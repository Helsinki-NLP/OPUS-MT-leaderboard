Members of the Wales Assembly do not want to go on the map.
Some members of the National Assembly would be displeased with the proposal to adopt the abbreviation MWP for their names (from Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The solution is related to plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from various political parties are concerned about possible jokes about this abbreviation.
One of the lobbyists, expressing his party's views, expressed concern that the new abbreviation “rifted Twp and Pwp”.
For our readers, not from Wales: the Valley twp means “tupid” and pwp means“ duck”.
According to a member of the Assembly of the Wales Party, his organization as a whole “was dissatisfied” and suggested other options.
Representatives of the conservative party “do not object” to the new abbreviation, but note that the MWP is close to Muppet.
In this context, the letter w in the Vallaian language is spoken almost like the letter u in the Yorkshire dialect of English.
The Assembly Committee, currently drafting a draft law on the change of name, made the following statement: “The final decision on what to call the members of the Assembly will, of course, remain behind.”
The Welsh Administration Act 2017 authorizes the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public opinion poll on the proposed options, according to which Parliament Wales replaced the Assembly with broad support among the local population.
With regard to the name of the members of the Assembly, the Committee favoured the option “Member of the Wales Parliament” (Welsh Parliament Members, or WMP), while the MWP option received the most public support.
It seems that the Assembly members are proposing other options, but it will be difficult for the presiding member, Elina Jones, to find a solution that will make all possible; let us recall that the draft amending law should be submitted within a few weeks.
The reform laws will include other modifications to the Assembly ' s working process, including new rules on disqualification of Assembly members and the Committee ' s system.
The members of the Assembly will vote in favour of the final version of their name during the debate on the bill.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change their country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians will vote in favour of the country's name in the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The popular vote is intended to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its province of Macedonia.
The Greek Government has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” implies territorial claims against the Greek province, and has repeatedly objected to its northern neighbour's accession to the European Union and NATO.
President Gjorge Ivanov of Macedonia, opponent of the change referendum, said that he was not going to accept its results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that changing the name of the country is the ultimate cost of joining the EU and NATO.
The crisis in the Harlems: St. Martin's Round is shut down forever.
“The elders in the area with which I had communicated said that there had been a bar and a church at every corner, ” Adams says.
“And now there is no other.”
The disappearance of bars is yet to be understood:
“Communication has changed”.
“Bar stopped being a sort of hotel all over the area where they came regularly.”
But as far as churches are concerned, funds from the sale of assets will be short-lived, no matter how their leaders rely on them.
At the site of the church, he added, there would be a multi-family home, whose residents would hardly support those in the area of arrival.
“Most of the buyers of these apartments will be white,” Adams says. “And this will be the day on which such churches will finally close, because the new neighbors will never be a part of them.”
Both churches were built with white congregations before Harlem became a black area: Metropolitan Comuniti in 1870; and St. Martin’s Church was built ten years later.
The first attendance of the Methodist Church left in the 1930s.
Their building was purchased by a black arrival in the neighborhood.
When St. Martin’s Church moved into the hands of a black community, it was headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a shop boycott on 125th Street, Harlem’s main trading artery, where they refused to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged as a result of the fire, and during the reconstruction work, Father Johnson’s father was ordered to install a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson, who changed him to the head of St. Martin's Church, proudly called the Carillon “the wheels of the poor”.
But the expert who tested the carillon in July referred to it as “a cultural heritage” and “a unique historical instrument”.
An expert from the University of Michigan Tiffany Ng also noted that it was the Carillon of St. Martin's Church that was the world's first instrument of the kind played by the black musician Dionysio A. Lind. 18 years ago that he was invited to play at a larger carillon in the Riverside Church.
According to Merrioezer, St. Martin’s Church has not yet been replaced.
The last few months around St. Martin’s Church have been difficult for architects and contractors, some of whom were invited by secular church leaders, others by the Episcopal Archdiocese.
The gathering of members, the governing body of the arrivals of world leaders, in July, turned to the diocese, expressing concern that the diocese would “try to transfer the cost of the work” to the assembly of its members, although the latter had nothing to do with choosing the architects and contractors assigned to the empire.
Some were displeased by the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
In California, a shark wounded a 13-year-old scuba diver who invented lobbying.
Official sources reported that on Saturday, the first day of the lobbying season, a 13-year-old diver was attacked and injured by a shark in California.
The attack took place about 7 a.m. near the Beach Beach Beach in Ensinitas.
As Chad Hammel said in an interview with KSWB-TV (San Diego), he dived with his friends on Saturday morning and heard a boy scream about help about half an hour later, and with his friends they swam on the boat to the scene of the attack and pulled the teenager out of the water.
According to Hammel, at first he decided that the boy was delighted with the lobster’s name, but he quickly “wrote that he was shouting, “I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
The dive to the diver, Hammel observed that “he had completely ripped his skin around the key”.
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water, ‘Here’s the shark, ” says Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Redy Children ' s Hospital (San Diego); his condition was assessed as critical.
The kind of shark that attacked a teenager, unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, reported during the press briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago but had not been taken to dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim of the attack was injured in the upper torso area.
The authorities blocked the area from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Ensinitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure the safety of the population.
Gails observed that there were 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them were not considered dangerous.
Seinsbury plans to subdue the UK perfumed cosmetic market
Seinsbury is going to set up cosmetics and perfumeries in Booths, Superdrag and Debenhams stores with cosmetologists, based on a model of luxury universes.
The UK perfumed and cosmetic market is estimated at £2.8 billion and continues to expand, while fashion and goods for sale are falling. In order to capture a significant proportion of this desired market as an experiment in 11 shops throughout the country, spacious cosmetics and perfumery units will be represented and, if successful next year, they should be expected in many other stores.
Supermarket owners are looking for a way to fill the shelves previously placed under televisions, microwave ovens, home goods, and investment in the perfumed cosmetic market seems to be a good solution.
According to the representatives of Seinsbury, it is planned to double the range of cosmetic products to 3,000 names, including for the first time trade marks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be presented on a larger scale, in specially selected locations, by the type of product organization in the Boots stores.
In addition, a firm guide for Boutique cosmetics products will be reorganized to meet the demands of young buyers.
Two of the Seinsbury stores will be presented to the perfume producer Fragrance Shop: the first one already opened in Croydon in south London last week, and the second one is expected to be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
The Internet trade and the tendency to buy a small amount of food every day in small benches near home led to the need for supermarkets to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Coop, President Seinsbury, says that the airports will gradually become a university, and his supermarket network fights for buyers in a competitive fight against cheap shops, such as Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food items.
There are hundreds of Sunsbury supermarkets with Argos and some of them have found Habitats stores since the network acquired both brands two years ago, which have led to an increase in the sale of food products and profits from these purchases.
Previous attempts at a supermarket to give new life to their cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments have failed.
The Seinsbury and Butts joint venture was organized in the early 2000s, but there were further differences between participants on the distribution of income from the sale of pharmaceuticals in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of the pharmaceutical business of Seinsbury (a total of 281 shops) by Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, for £125 million three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the implementation of the plan by adding a wide range of luxuries to care for La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Says Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Seinsbury: “We have completely transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our perfumery and cosmetics departments in order to create a more favourable environment for our buyers.
We have also invited specially trained consultants who will always be ready to help with the advice.
Our range of stamps for any taste, pleasant design and convenience of shops will attract many visitors in search of cosmetics and perfumes. This will be a completely new concept of shopping.”
Peter Jones “vulnerably” responded to Holly Willoughby’s withdrawal from the deal of £11 million
Peter Johns is angry with Holly Willoughby's TV broadcast from a deal of £11 million, which she intended to make with Peter's Lifestail Brand, but instead preferred new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willowby doesn't have time for their joint brand of Truly home clothes and accessories.
This couple's business was compared to Goop's actress, Gwynette Peltrow.
The 37-year-old lead programme, this morning, announced its decision in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby's decision to leave them with a profitable Lifestail Brand to focus on the new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV, led to Peter Jones' rage, the Star of the Dragon Hunt.
According to our sources, Jones was “worn” when a fan of television players during a tense meeting held at his business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday, admitted that after the conclusion of new contracts worth up to 1.5 million she would not have enough time for their common brand of household clothes and accessories Truly.
They were compared to the child's actress, Gwynette Peltrow, the Goop brand, and it was expected that its sales would double Willoughby's condition, estimated at £11 million.
The 37-year-old lead announced her resignation to Instagram, while Jones himself left Britain on a private plane in the direction of one of his villas.
According to one source, “the Truly brand was Holly’s top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would provide her with careless existence for the next few decades.
Its decision led all parties to the deal.
Everyone was shocked by what happened on Tuesday, as there were weeks left before the launch.
At the headquarters in Marlowe, there remains a warehouse filled with goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of the leading One Morning, one of Britain's most popular stars, could cost the firm millions of pounds sterling due to significant investments in goods, from pillows and candles to clothing, and the potential delay in starting the line.
In addition, it is a breakup of old friendships.
The three raising kids Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willowby created Truly's brand with Tara Capp in 2016, and Tara's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, headed the company's management in March.
Both couples often spend vacations together, and also Jones owns 40% of the shares of Dan Baldwin's television company.
Willowby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Anthony Macpartlin as the lead broadcaster of ITV "I am the celebrity".
A source from a nearby area of Jones said last night, "We can't comment on his business."
Complex negotiations, “and then we loved each other”
He made a joke about the criticism that the media would be overturned by the “indecent president” of the commentary and the positive appreciation of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump drop so many claims?
He said Trump, imitating the voice of the lead news.
"Nothing I haven't given up on."
He noted that Kim Chen Yin was interested in a second meeting after Trump called them the first summit held in Singapore in June a significant step towards reducing the stockpiles of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations are deadlocked.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, the high-ranking North Korean diplomat Lee Young Ho addressed world leaders at a meeting of the UN General Assembly on Saturday, stating that North Korea is still waiting for “appropriate responses” from the United States following the initial DPRK disarmament measures.
Instead, the United States, a diplomat noted, continues to use sanctions as a lever of pressure.
President Trump made a much more optimistic assessment during the gathering of his supporters.
“With North Korea things are going to be great,” he said.
“We were on the verge of war with North Korea.
Millions of people could die.
And now we have an excellent relationship."
According to Trampa, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Chen Yin had borne fruit: the rocket tests had been stopped, the hostages had been released, and US soldiers had also returned to their homeland.
Speaking of his relationship with Kim Chen Yin, Trump stressed that his unusual approach to diplomacy was not unusual.
“It’s so easy to tell the President, but then instead of 10,000 people in the street that are tearing down into this completely beaten room, there would be only 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd gathered before him.
In Indonesia, tsunamis and earthquakes: catastrophic destruction recorded, hundreds of victimsName
In the first days of the earthquake that struck Lombok, foreign NGOs said that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had lost their roof over their heads, the Government did not find it necessary to declare a national natural disaster, which was a compulsory condition for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that international support was not needed, so it was not easy,” says Selina Sambung.
Save the Children is preparing a team to send to Pala, but we do not know if the foreign team will be able to work on the ground.
According to Mr. Sutopo, the official representative of the National Disaster Management Office, the Indonesian leadership is assessing the situation in Palu in order to determine whether international organizations should be involved.
In view of the continuing seismic instability in Indonesia, the country continues to be horrifyingly ill-prepared for natural disasters.
Although Tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other shorelines.
Despite a tsunami threat warning, no siren was included in Palu to warn the population, most likely resulting in so many victims.
Transport between the numerous Indonesian islands is quite problematic, even in good weather.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The floating hospital, previously moored in Lombock to assist the victims of the earthquake, is on its way to Pala, but the road to a new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joko Vidodo made the strengthening of Indonesia's infrastructure a key element of his election campaign and spent untold funds on improving roads and railways.
However, President Joko's administration, which is on its way to a new deadline next year, has been derailed by funding problems.
The President is also criticized for exacerbating interfaith hatred between the conservative Muslim majority of Indonesia and the rest of the population.
Over a thousand people were killed, and tens of thousands were left with blood as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed machetes, bows with arrows and other shells.

Cromwell's Monument to Parliament sparked a heated debate on the “translation of history”
Cromwell's expulsion would be a well-deserved retribution for the barbaric destruction of the numerous cultural and religious artifacts of England by his followers, the Puritan fanatics.
However, the Society of Remembrance of Cromwell called the proposal of Mr. Cryk “insultance” and “an attempt to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, President of the Society of Memory of Cromwell, stated: “As part of the ongoing debate on the demolition of historical monuments, the question of Oliver Cromwell's statue to the Westminster Palace inevitably arose.
Cromwell had nothing to do with the iconocouric movement during the English civil wars.
Perhaps Oliver Cromwell suffers from the sins of his ancestor, Thomas, who lived centuries earlier.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell of the authorship of Sir William Hamo Tornikroft reflects the views of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of a man whom many still regard as worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith said: “Many people, especially at the end of the 19th century, considered Cromwell to be a defender of Parliament from external pressure, in which case the monarchy.
Whether such an opinion can be considered historically accurate remains the subject of the expert debate.
But it can be said with confidence that the conflict that arose in the mid-17th century affected our country's subsequent development, and Cromwell was a significant historical person representing one side of this section.
Its achievements as Lord Protector also merit high appreciation and respect.”
A Chinese farmer was killed by a pig killer.
In one of the markets in south-western China, a farmer is a pig victim, local media reports.
The affected body of the victim (in the media only mentions his name, Yuan) with the severed artery found near the hill on the market in Lupanshui province of Guajzhou in southern China. This was reported by Morning Post on Sunday.
The pigs are preparing to bring vaccinations to pigs on a pig farm on 30 May 2005, Sinin district of Qinghai Province of China.
Yuan and his cousin arrived from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, the cousin found Yuan’s breathless body, while the door to the nearby piglet was opened.
There was a huge blood spatter on the rill in the piglet.
A forensic examination found that the pig weighed 250 kg of the farmer dead.
“My brother’s feet were covered and searched, ” said Guyang Evening News Wu, a relative of the deceased.
The surveillance video showed that Yuan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The killer pig wasn't the brothers.
The market manager told the newspaper Evening News that the pigs had been isolated in a separate unit during the investigation, in order to avoid repeated attacks.
It is reported that the Yuan family is negotiating with the market administration for compensation for the farmer's death.
Porcine attacks occur uncommonly.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in the U.S. state of Massachusetts, severely traumatizing a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound-pounded animal plunged a Vallaian peasant onto a tractor and let her go, just afraid of a supportive wife.
In 2012, a farmer from Oregon in the United States had been eaten by his own pigs, and as CBC News told a Canadian farmer, pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act on their hidden aggression as a trigger mechanism.
“The pigs are playing,
They're cute and very curious, but they don't have a purpose in insulting you.
You should simply inculcate in your animals a sense of action and respect," he explained.
Hurricane Rosa will bring castings to a large part of the South-West United States
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to be losing power as she moves through the cooler-water zone to the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, in the next few days it will bring rain and floods into northern Mexico and south-west of the United States.
As of Saturday, 5 a.m. in New York City, the cyclone reached the 1st category with winds up to 135 km/h, 360 kilometres south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure zone is beginning to develop over the Pacific Ocean, which will move east to the western coast of the United States, nearing the coast of the state of Lower California, a storm will bring tropical moisture north of Mexico to the south-west of the United States.
More than 25 cm of precipitation is expected in Mexico on Monday.
Heavy castings are expected in the coming days in South-West due to tropical humidity that has entered the emerging low pressure zone.
Precipitation from 2.5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous rainwaters, muddy streams and possible landslides in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona, the rate of precipitation can be 5 to 8 cm per hour due to high tropical air humidity.
In some areas south-west of the United States, mostly in most of Arizona, precipitation is expected to reach between 5 and 10 cm.
The risk of sudden rapid development floods is not excluded due to uneven distribution of tropical rains.
At the current risk of tropical rainwater, walking in the desert has serious consequences.
The lions can turn the canyons into stormy rivers, and the thunder can cause the pitching winds to blow up the clouds of dust.
With low pressure zones on the coast of southern California, there will be flooding.
A drop of up to 1.5 cm may occur, which can cause small congealing flows and create slippery surfaces on the roads.
This is the first rainfall since the beginning of the rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evening and morning, tropical rains will take place in Arizona on Monday morning, extending to other territories by Monday evening and Tuesday morning.
By Tuesday, the valleys will take place in the four corners of the area and will be extended until the middle of the night.
In October there will be severe temperature fluctuations throughout the U.S., due to the low Arctic air temperature at fairly high tropical temperatures.
Sometimes this combination leads to severe temperature fluctuations in a small area.
Such extreme temperatures will be particularly noticeable in the central United States on Sunday.
Between temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and De Moines, Iowa, there is a difference of almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, summer heat will accumulate and extend to other territories.
In most central and eastern U.S. territories, warm weather is expected in early October, and the temperature will reach 27 degrees in the South Plains to the North East.
In New York City, Tuesday, air temperatures can rise to a temperature of up to 27 degrees Fahrenheit [27 ° C], 10 degrees Fahrenheit [10 ° C] above average.
Our long-term weather forecast promises an unusually high temperature on the eastern coast of the United States by mid-October.
Senate hearings on Judge Bretta Kavano's case saw more than 20 million viewers
The testimony of Brett Cavanaugh and Kristina Blazi Ford, who accused Cavanaugh of attempted rape in the 1980s, attracted over 20 million viewers of six television channels on Thursday.
The political opposition to Kavano's candidacy was unexpectedly continued, and an urgent communication was received in the media on Friday: Republican Jeff Flake made provision that the charges against the lawyer should be investigated by the FBI within one week.
As Ford stated at the Senate Legal Committee hearings, she believed “100 per cent” that Kavano was in a state of intoxication and tried to strip her at a school party.
Cavanaugh gave emotional testimony, stating that 100 per cent were confident that this was not the case.
According to the Nielsen Research Agency, Friday debates saw more than 20.4 million viewers.
The Agency took into account average data from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
Data on the number of audiences of other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, are not yet available.
Moreover, Nielsen’s rating does not always take into account viewers watching television at work.
In comparison, this is the middle audience following the US football match in playoffs or the Oscar handing ceremony.
The largest audience was at Fox News Channel, whose leading team strongly supported Kavano's appointment: Senate hearings that lasted all day looked at an average of 5.69 million viewers, reported to Nielsen.
The second is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS audience was 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC saw 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen reported.
After the hearing, the interest in the case was far from weakened.
On Friday, a real drama was played with Jeff Flake.
After a senator from Arizona who was considered a moderate Republican, he announced his intention to support Kavano's candidacy, CNN TV channels and CBS, he was able to seal the cell as Flake met with a group of activists who criticized the senator on Friday morning.
The whole world has seen him get a whiff of angry women on live CNN.
“I am standing before you, ” said one of them.
“Do you think he's telling the country the truth?”
“For you, while so many women are powerless, try to explain their position.
Flake told the activists that his office had already prepared a statement and he would address it at the committee meeting, and the elevator doors closed, closing the senator's vault from the cell.
When, a few hours later, the Legal Committee prepared to approve Kavano ' s candidacy and send it to the Senate for a general vote, all television channels broadcast the meeting live.
However, Flake made one condition — that the FBI investigate the charges against the candidate by next week as a democratic minority sought.
Flake claims to have changed his mind with the intervention of a friend, a senator from the Democrats Chris Kuns.
He made the final decision by talking to Kuns and several senators.
Flaka ' s decision had had an effect, as it was obvious that the Republicans lacked the votes to approve Kavano without an investigation.
By order of President Trump, the FBI opened an investigation into charges against Kavano.
British Prime Minister Teresa May accuses his critics of “political games” over the Brexith situation
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May accused politicians of criticizing her plan to leave the European Union of putting the interests of the small party ahead of society.
The British Prime Minister is attending a conference of a conservative party in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published on one May interview, former M.I.D. President Boris Johnson criticized her as the so-called "Chashki" plan within the framework of Brexit, claiming that she considered the introduction of customs duties between Britain and the EU "absolutely ridiculous".
Wade Simms' death in a shooting: Police have arrested Diane Simpson on suspicion of murder of a force guard at Louisiana University.
The police arrested a man suspected of murder as a result of a firefight by Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for Louisiana University.
According to the Baton Rouge police, 20-year-old Dateon Simpson was arrested and detained on second-degree charges.
The police released a video of a fight involving Sims and Simpson in which Sims lost his points.
According to WAFB, the CBS regional channel, the police found the DNA of Simpson at points found at the scene of the crime.
During his interrogation, Simpson admitted that he had wounded Wade in death.
According to the Advocate, a $350,000 bet has been set for Simpson.
The coroner of the east district of Baton Rouge published a preliminary detention on Friday: death was caused by a combined gunshot wound to the neck and head.
The Division thanks the Louisiana State Police Criminal Investigation Division, the State Criminal Police Laboratory, the South University Police and the locals for assisting in the rapid investigation of detention.
Joe Alleva, Director of Sports of the University of Louisiana, thanked the rule of law for their “good work in naming the criminal”.
Simsu was only 20 years old.
The two-inch forward was a Baton Rouge harvester, and his father Wayne also played for the Louisiana University team.
In the past season, Simms collected 5.6 points and made 2.6 average match selections.
Team coach Will Wade made a statement on Friday morning, saying that Wade Sims' tragic death caused shock and “current woe” among all players.
"That's what I've always feared," added the coach.
The volcano covered Mexico City’s ashes
Vulcan Popocatepetl sank the ashes of the southern outskirts of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Centre for Natural Disaster Prevention of Mexico recommended that the population should not approach the volcano: its crater recorded activity and 183 evaporative emissions per day.
According to the Centre’s observations, there were frequent logging and shivering near the volcano.
In some areas of Mexico City, such as Sochimilko, social network users have published photographs of frontal glass cars covered with a thin layer of ash.
Following the 7.1 Mw earthquake, which rocked the central part of Mexico in September 2017, geophysics recorded an increasing volcanic activity 72 kilometres south-east of the capital.
Vulcan Popocatepetl (or, for its own sake, Don Goyo) has been an active volcano since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the first anniversary of the referendum on independence
A multi-month rally took place on Saturday in Barcelona on the first anniversary of the referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which split the country into two camps, and there were no clashes between the supporters of independence of autonomy and the police; six of the riots were taken into custody.
The police pushed down protestors of independence, while the latter, dressed in black masks, threw away their eggs and powdered paint, raising the clouds of dark dust at the heart of Barcelona.
After the police dropped the crowds in the air, the riots resumed with new force.
For a few hours, independence advocates chanted, “We won’t forget, we won’t forgive,” and their opponents replied with a slogan, “Hello, Spain!”.
According to local press reports, 14 participants in the action were hospitalized with minor injuries.
On 1 October last year, a referendum was held on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which was recognized as illegal by the Spanish Government, but became an important milestone for separatists.
The Catalonia, with a huge overhang, voted in favour of leaving Spain, but the phenomenon was low because the opponents of the withdrawal mostly boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan official sources, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year in attempts to block a referendum at polling stations in violent clashes.
On Friday, the separatists nighted on the stated path of following a demonstration in support of the Spanish police in order to prevent it from taking place.
The demonstration was still taking place, but it took a different route.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcisse Termes, who visited a separatist rally in his wife's company, recalled that the hope of gaining sovereignty by Catalonia was becoming more and more confusing.
“Last year one of the most important events in our lives occurred.
My parents cried out for happiness with the opportunity to vote in a referendum, and today we are in suspended condition," he said.
In the recent December elections to local governments, the Catalan parties in favour of the separation from Spain have won an important victory, albeit with a small lead, but this year their movement is losing supporters, as many of the leaders of the movement are either on the run or in custody, awaiting the court ' s role in organizing a referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Pooch, a 42-year-old mechanic who enrolls a rally in support of the police, said that the conflict was heated by both sides of the political spectrum.
“The voltage is rising,” he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Zunkeras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalan Separatists, from the end of last year's pre-trial detention, announced his intention to run into the European Parliament next year.
“Participation in the next European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish Government,” he said.
Londonderry: the car crashed into the house, all three of the co-conspirators arrested
One of Londonberry’s houses was parked several times by car, where men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested.
The visit took place on Thursday, around 7:30 local time in Ballinaard Crossent.
As a result of the packaging, the gate and the building itself were damaged, according to Criminal Police Inspector Bob Blemmings.
There's been reports that a bow shot could have been fired in the car.
Livingstone's Victory over Rangers thanks to the Mengi Markh Goal
The first goal of Dolly Mengi brought a guaranteed victory to the Livingstone team.
Thanks to the beating of Livingstone, he won an unexpected victory over Rangers. For the main coach of the Scottish club, Stephen Gerard, this is just the second defeat for 18 games.
Dolly Mengi's punctual impact leveled Gary Holt's team with the Hiburnian Club in the chart, where they split second.
Gerard's club has been free to go to this Premier League season, and on Sunday there will be a meeting with the leaders of the group, the Harts, from which Rangers lags for eight points.
On Thursday, Rangers will host the European League match with the Austrian club Rapid (Vienna).
Livingstone Club continues to play its playing series in the division by playing six matches and not getting any damage since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as the chief coach of the team.
Missed moments for Livingstone in gripping with hard-working guests
Coach Holt's trustees were supposed to keep an account from the very beginning — the Rangers were obviously not able to cope with their efforts.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the line of defense, but the naked one of his weak attempts failed, and then Alan Lithgou, the defender, swinging too wide, couldn't stop Keig Halketta from getting into the net.
The host party allowed Rangers to play in front of their line of protection, counting on dangerous moments at the resumption of the game.
That's how they missed this important goal.
Rangers gave way to a free kick, and Livingstone took the opportunity: Declan Gallagher and Robinson made a handover to Menge, who killed him from the central position.
By then, Rangers had the advantage of possessing the ball, but the protection of the host team was impenetrable, so the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not concerned.
The second time continued in the same pattern, although Kelly still had to strike back from Alfredo Morelos.
The Rangers doorman Alan McGregregor kicked off Scott Pittman, and Litgo made a big deal out of the standard position.
The swords were constantly caught in Livingstone's fine, but all the attacks were reflected, and the two penalty demands, one for triggering Glenn Middleton's spare game and the other for playing by hand, were not met.
"Phenomenal" game "Livingstone" — analysis
From BBC Scotland — Alastair Lamont, a report with Tony Makaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a great result for the Livingstone team.
Absolutely all of the players were great, and once again, they exceeded their expectations by continuing to be the football Olympics.
Their style of play and composition has remained virtually unchanged since their entry to top rankings, and coach Holt's great credit for mobilizing this team from the outset.
There were a lot of real heroes on his team.
Captain Halket led a perfectly organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warallu from relaxing.
At the same time, Rangers could not enter the rhythm.
Although they had a good time playing with Coach Gerard, this time they failed to meet our expectations.
In recent minutes, they lacked the power of the ball and only once managed to defend the host team. The Rangers, who had dropped into the middle of the table, had something to think about.
Erdogon's cold reception during a visit to Cologne
Saturday, 29 September, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast, the weather was beautiful, and the two superiors were in a great mood.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany to establish relations between the two NATO countries, a visit that had already involved some conflicts.
Heads of country were unable to understand such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
After Erdogan went to Cologne to participate in the opening ceremony of a huge new mosque.
Cologne has the largest Turkish diaspora outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police did not allow a 25-thousand mob to enter the mosque, but many Ergogan supporters were in position to see their president.
In the same place, opposers of the Ergogan regime, including the Kurds, gathered to condemn in full both Erdogon’s policy and the German Government’s decision to invite him to Germany.
A radically opposing view of the meeting reflects the mixed nature of the figure: many Germans with Turkish roots despise Erdogon, while others view him as a tyrant.
Deptford road accident: a collision with a car led to the death of a cyclist
In London, the car faced a cyclist who died at the scene.
The accident occurred not far from Beestud Street and Evelyn Street, a lively crossover in the south-eastern part of the city of Depefort, approximately 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car and the ambulance were trying to help the cyclist, but the man died unconscious.
This is not the only fatal accident in the area: just a mile and a half from the scene, on Childers Street, another cyclist was hit by a vehicle whose driver was hidden.
The London police report that work is currently under way to identify the deceased and to notify his immediate relatives.
Meanwhile, roadblocks and bus routes have been closed and changed at the scene: drivers are asked to stay away from the area.
Long-Lartin prison riots: six police officers wounded
Six police officers were reportedly wounded during the riots in the men ' s high-security prison.
The Long-Lartin (Wustershire) regime of men's high-security prison has been in turmoil since Sunday, which has been around 9:30 local time.
The Tornado group was responsible for the repression of the riots involving eight prisoners from one wing.
Police officers suffered minor injuries to the soft tissue of the person and were provided with medical assistance on the ground.
According to the prison official, “in order to resolve the incident at the Long-Lartin Correctional Facility, special trained staff were recruited.
Six of them were injured.
We categorically condemn the use of physical force in our institution, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and their preventive measures may be changed for a longer period.”
Long-Lartin currently holds over 500 prisoners, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the prison manager had been hospitalized and attacked by a prisoner.
In October of last year, the prison authorities were forced to engage special-purpose units in order to calm the raging prisoners who threw their billiards into the guards.
Hurricane Rosa could sink Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which would benefit the drylands)
Arizona rarely enters the zone of an intense tropical cyclone, but this time it was lucky: early next week, Hurricane Rosa, after the last break, must pass over the desert part of the South-West and risk the rainwaters.
The National Meteorological Service has already warned of the threat of rainwaters on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and south and eastern Nevada, south-east California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to take a straight line over Phoenix on Tuesday and fall through the rainwater on Monday night.
The Phoenician National Meteorological Service reported in Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression since 1950, within a radius of 320 km from Phoenix.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) passed 65 km from the border of Arizona.”
According to the latest projections of the National Meteorological Service, it will fall from 5 to 10 cm in precipitation, reaching 15 cm on the Arizona Plain of Mogolon Rome.
In other desert regions of the South-West region, such as the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is possible to drop to 2.5 to 5 cm in precipitation, and precipitation can reach 10 cm in rainfall.
The rain brought by Hurricane Rosa may be a real blessing for areas whose torrential flows will pass away, since the region has long been plagued by drought.
While reindeer floods may pose a risk, heavy rains can facilitate a dry season that does not take place in the South-West of the United States.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 per cent of the territory of Arizona has at least a strong drought (second heavy category),” says the weather.com website.
First, Hurricane Rosa will attack the Mexican state of Lower California.
As of Sunday morning, a hurricane with a maximum speed of 137 km/h is 360 km south of the town of Punta Eugenia (Mexico), moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
Hurricane found himself in a cooler zone on the Pacific coast, thus losing its power.
In the afternoon, the hurricane will reach Mexico in the category of “tropical storm”.
It is expected that there will be massive flood-threatening floods in some areas of Mexico.
“The territory from Lower California to North-West Sonora may fall to 7-10 cm in precipitation, places up to 25 cm,” reports the weather.com website.
Hurricane Rosa will then head north through the territory of Mexico, and on Tuesday morning, he will reach the border with Arizona in the tropical cyclone category, and from Arizona he will come to the southern part of the state of Utah by Tuesday evening.
“The main potential risk associated with Hurricane Rosa and its remains is the heavy rainwaters in Lower California, the north-west of Sonora and the deserts in the south-west of the United States,” reports the National Meteorological Service.
It is expected that precipitation will cause dangerous rainwater floods, floodwater flows in the desert and possible landslides in the mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton assault: four suspects arrested in attempted murder
In Somerset, a 16-year-old boy was seriously stabbed and three young men and 20-year-olds were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The victim of a severe injury was found in the area of Excelsior Terras in Midsomer Norton about 4 a.m. on Saturday.
After hospitalization, his condition is assessed as “stable”.
On the same night, four suspects aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in Radstock, reporting Avon and Somerset County Police.
The police are looking for possible witnesses to a crime that has any video footage of a mobile phone.
Donald Trump: On Cavanaugh, “all hatred, all the malice of the Democrats”
“The voice behind Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics used by the Democrats,” said Trump at a rally of his fellow countrymen in Wilinga, West Virginia.
According to Trampa, during the process of approving the nomination of Kavano, the candidate was “injured by all hatred, all malice” of the Democratic Party.
On Thursday, Cavanaugh gave testimony at the U.S. Congress, in his emotional response, categorically rejecting Christine Blazi Ford's accusation that he sexually harassed her more than 30 years ago when they were both teenagers.
Dr. Ford also testified during the prosecution hearing.
On Saturday, the President of the United States said that on that day, “the American people saw the brilliant mind, class and courage” of Cavanaugh.
“The vote for the approval of Judge Kavano is a vote for the approval of one of the most outstanding lawyers of our time, with an uncontaminated public service list,” said the president of the group of his colleagues in West Virginia.
In his speech, the President indirectly addressed the issue of the nomination of Kavano, referring to the importance of the Republican appearance of elections in Congress and the House of Representatives.
“For the most important elections in our lives, only five weeks remain.
I do not participate in them, but I participate in the race in another sense," he said.
“I am worn as burnt and I am fighting for our excellent candidates.”
Trump believes that the Democrats have set themselves the task of “strengthening us with every force”.
By regulation, the first key vote in the Senate, following the approval of the Kavano candidacy, should be held no later than Friday, reported by the Assistant High Representative of the Republican Party.
The earthquake in Indonesia claimed hundreds of lives, and the total number of victims continues to rise
On Saturday, the Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had been killed, many of whom had been taken by giant waves taking over the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulava, which had been hit by an incredible tsunami and an earthquake.
The first victims of the disaster were hundreds of visitors to the beach festival in Palu, where on Friday the coastline reached waves of almost six metres high, which boldly made their way and led to the instant death of many of the present.
Tsunami followed the 7.5 Magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale.
“When a storm warning was announced yesterday, people continued their beach vacation instead of immediately escaping into hiding and lost their lives as a result,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, official representative of the Indonesian National Disaster Management Office at a press conference held in Jakarta.
“The tsunamis did not come in one way, with the flow of water being cars, the logs, the whole houses, the storm destroyed everything on its way,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami had crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km/h and had hit the coast.
Some of those present were taken to the trees that saved their lives.
Approximately 16,700 local residents were evacuated in 24 shelters in Palu.
At the air photo shoot of the disaster management office, there are destroyed houses, shops, bridges and a flooded mosque.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still shaken by underground pushes.
An earthquake has occurred in the territory of 2.4 million people.
The statement by the Agency for the Assessment and Use of Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) indicates that the earthquake-induced energy emissions were about 200 times higher than the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
The tsunami may have been stronger than expected from the geographic location of the city at the end of the long narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as “scale”, adding that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of the dead were found in the ruins of the buildings, with 540 injured, and 29 others missing.
Nugroho added that victims and destruction could be even more extensive along the coastline of 300 km from Palu, at the site of Dungal, which was closer to the earthquake epicentre.
Communications from Dungal were “completely destroyed, received no information”.
“Over 300,000 people live in the area of Dungal”, reports the International Committee of the Red Cross, whose staff and volunteers have already gone to the disaster zone.
“A tragedy has occurred, but it is not yet a limit”, the communication said.
The Office was severely criticized on Saturday because it did not report the arrival of the tsunamis in Palu, but the authorities believe that the waves reached the coast at the time when the initial warning was still in effect.
Social networks have produced a loving video in which a man on the top floor screams about the impending tsunami, desperately trying to attract people's attention on the street.
A few minutes later, a wall of water is being demolished, entire houses and cars are being carried away.
Reuters has not yet been able to confirm the authorship of this video.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have led to major electrolytes, which have caused Palu to lose communication, which has made life-saving operations very difficult.
Military transport aircraft were sent from Jakarta and other cities with humanitarian assistance, but the evacuated population still lacked food and essential supplies, government sources reported.
The city airport was opened only for humanitarian assistance; it would be closed for other flights until October.
On Sunday, the evacuation centres in Palu will be visited by President Joko Vidodo.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's a very bad situation.
The volunteers of the World Vision Charity Organization arrived safely from Dungala to Palu, where the staff found shelter in the tarpaulin tents that were broken into the yard of their office building.
“They saw a huge number of destroyed houses, ” he says.
It's a very bad situation.
Charity organizations have begun to implement humanitarian assistance mechanisms, but many complain that experts from international NCAs have not been able to reach Palu.
Indonesian legislation allows for the recruitment of financing, humanitarian assistance and personnel from foreign organizations only after the announcement of the site where the disaster struck the national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It is considered to be a local disaster,” says Aulia Ariani, Spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the Government announces a national disaster, we will be able to accept foreign aid, but so far the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster that struck Palu, the friends and relatives of the missing, still look forward to their wonderful salvation, which will bring the people back to their faith in the best.
A little boy fell into a sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuers dragged a woman who spent two days there, next to her mother's breathless body, from the wreckage of the building.
Gendon Subandono, a national team coach for paraplaneism, has prepared two of the missing pilots for the recent Asian Games in Indonesia.
Among other people trapped in Roa Roa’s hotel were his disciples, including Mandagi.
“I’m not the last person in this sport, and it’s emotionally difficult to survive,” he said.
Ghendon recalls that after learning about Roa Roa's breach from other paraplanetists, during the next hours he desperately tried to contact whatsApp with his pala buddies who were resting at the beach festival.
However, his reports were presented with one set of beams, not two pigeons.
“This means that no messages have been received,” he says.
Derzka kraja $26,750 during ATM maintenance in Newport-on-Liwi
On Friday morning, the insurgency kidnapped $26,750 from Brink's, a cashier in the city of Newport-on-Liwie, in a press release from the NYPD.
According to investigator Dennis McCarthy, a armoured van driver took cash from a ATM located in a entertainment complex and was going to supply it with new bills.
At that time, “a man named Brink's from his back has been run over by a criminal and stole a bag of ATM bills.
Several suspects were reported to have escaped from the scene of the incident, but the police did not indicate the number of potential participants.
Citizens with any information on these persons are requested to contact the Newport Police Department, number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Yee
Rapper Kanye West came up with a new name: Yeh.
He announced on Saturday in Twitter: “The personality formerly known as Kanye West”.
41-year-old West has long worn this alias and even named it his eighth album, which came out in June.
News of this appeared in advance of Kanye's release on Saturday Night Live, where he plans to present his new Yandhi album.
Kanye West will be a co-conspirator in place of Ariana's singer, who cancelled her participation because of “emotional experiences”, the author of the transfer reports.
West had previously stated that the pseudonym was not only a reduced version of his name but also a religious sense.
“Yes, the most common word in the Bible means “you, ” as West explained the name of his album in one of the recent Big Boy radio interviews.
"I mean, it's you, it's me.
First, there was Kanye, which means “single one, ” and now I’m the only one who reflects all the good, bad, misunderstood things in us right away.
And the album is an attempt to figure out who we are.”
Kanie's not the first known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Deeddy, Pi Diddi, or simply Diddi, asked to call himself Love this year or Brassa Love.
Westo's rapper, J.Z., also changed his name several times: with a defis, and without, capital letters or strings.
President of Mexico solemnly pledges not to use military forces against civilians
President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico vowed never to resort to military force against the civilian population in the run-up to the 50th anniversary of a student demonstration that had ended in a bloody confrontation.
Speaking on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square, President López Obrador promised to “never resort to military assistance to suppress the Mexican people”.
On 2 October 1968, during a peaceful demonstration of students, the first shots were fired on the crowd and a massacre began, which claimed the lives of 300 people, which occurred against the backdrop of an increase in left student movements in Latin America.
López Obrador also promised to support Mexican youth through a monthly scholarship to study and to open more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and the lack of school opportunities lead young people to a criminal world.
The funding of the development of FDI needs to be doubled.
China and its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence (IDI) — the United States should redouble its investment in scientific developments, believes that Lee Caifa, investor and entrepreneur in the development of FDI with experience in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Several U.S. ministries have made prior statements on the IDI, although the United States as a whole does not have a clear strategy for the development of IDI.
At the same time, China presented its own plan last year: its goal was to be the first in the innovations of FDI by 2030.
“Increasing the research budget for FDI would twice be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind in the United States, and we expect the next breakthrough in the field of FDI,” Lee said.
The increase in funding could double the chances that the next major FDI achievement would be made in the United States, Lee CNBC said in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “The Superintendent of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order”, was published this month by Haughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Director-General of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most outstanding companies in China, China, Face ++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie-Mello, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that surpassed the highest player in American Otello, and then he was a leader in Microsoft Research and the president of Google China.
Li mentioned previous US government technology competitions, such as Robotics Challenge of Defence Advanced Research Projects, and asked when the next competition would be held to help find people with unconventional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
“It is not China that absorbs academic leaders, but corporations,” Li.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring light from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Li is convinced that changes in immigration policies can also help the United States develop artificial intelligence.
“I think that the Green Cards should automatically be offered to the candidates in the field of artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Council of State published a plan for the development of artificial intelligence for the next generation.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation provides scientists with funding similar to that of the National Science Fund and other governmental organizations that provide money to American researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower, Lee argues.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre of Artificial Intelligence, with industrial and scientific partners involved, and the White House announced the establishment of an Ad Hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced the investment of $2 billion in the AI Next programme.
With regard to NSF, he is currently investing more than $100 million a year in the research of FDI.
However, the U.S. legislation, which has sought to establish a National Intelligence Security Commission, has been failing to take action in this regard for several months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would resolve the multi-year dispute with Greece, which blocked its applications for entry into the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is a province of Macedonia, argues that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim in its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments concluded an agreement based on the proposal for a new name, but opposition nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slav majority of the Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not vote in a referendum and the boycott campaign questioned whether the voter appearance would correspond to the minimum of 50 per cent required for the referendum.
The question raised in the referendum was: “Do you support NATO and EU membership, subject to the adoption of a treaty with Greece?”
The supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that Macedonia, one of the countries emerging after the break-up of Yugoslavia, should pay this price for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that she could live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska, a resident of Skopje.
A sufficient number of members of Parliament stated that they would observe the outcome of the vote to make it decisive, although it was not legally binding.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority of the members of Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no violations were reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe”, says 62-year-old Yose Tanevski, an elector from Skopje’s capital.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia on a change in the name of the country, which will pave the way for her joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Before Parliament's building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage by putting chairs in front of tents set up by citizens who are going to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and EU membership, but we want to be united with a high-level head, rather than bypassing the thresholds of the cabinets of officials,” Kavadarkov said.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of self-esteem.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can address other countries, like China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring investments in Macedonia, which were so much needed in that country, where unemployment was more than 20 per cent.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour of, because more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO”, Zayev said after the vote.
He believes that a positive response will be “a key to our prosperous future”.
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies showed that between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, but that was below the required figure.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telecom TV channel found that 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of this quantity is claimed to be a positive vote.
For the referendum to take place, the phenomenon must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first major blow to the policy of the Western Government since it came to power last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City bypasses the Bryton defense to kill the goal
Sergio Aguaro and Rahim Sterling quarreled with Brayton's protection, bringing Manchester City to a 2-0 victory on Saturday at the Taehad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguaro scored a 65-minute goal, it seemed like he had no problem.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine attacker received a pass in the center of the field.
He scurried among the three brayton defenders before breaking into open space.
Aguaero was surrounded by four rivals in green T-shirts.
He left one defender behind and took a few more to the edge of the Brighton fine zone.
He then handed the sword to Sterling on the left.
An English striker in the fine zone returned Aguero's ball to the right leg of Matthew Ryan's doorman to the right corner of the gate.
“Aguaero is experiencing some problems with his legs,” said Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola to journalists.
“We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are fortunate that he killed the goal at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an initial advantage in the fight against the Premier League.
That goal was scored at 29 minutes.
In this game, Aguero won the ball, deep inside Brayton
He gave a great cut on the left flank on Leroy Sana.
Sanye made a few appeal before handing over Sterling to the long haul.
The invader, the Blue Sky, killed the ball at the gate right before flying out of the field.
Manchester City collided with Hoffenheim in the League of Champions group on Tuesday at 12:55 on the Rhine-Keckar-Arene in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer's going to pick out the points at Colorado Rockies.
After Washington Nationals left the battle for playoff, there was no particular reason to push events.
But the tireless Sherzer hopes to take the lead in the fight against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if Roquez has one game ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division has problems in playoffs.
By winning 5-2 over Nationals on Friday night, Roquez had already won at least 7 or 8 seats, but they were still hoping to get their title in the first division.
“Although we play just that, but at least we can maintain positions, knowing of the great importance of the atmosphere in Denver in the presence of viewers and other teams, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss such a thing?"
Nationals has not yet announced a drinker on Sunday, but, according to the latest data, in the current situation, they tend to put Sherzer on that role.
Sherzer, going out for the 34th game on Thursday, threw the ball on the pitcher, and on Sunday, on his weekend, he'd be a pitcher.
Washington, DC – 18-7 rating ERA 2.53 and 300 cars in 220 2/3 innings in the current season.
The Trump is holding a pre-election race in Western Virginia
Referring to the importance of the Republican appearance in the interim elections, the President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavano, the candidacy put forward by the President to the Supreme Court.
“All we did was put on the map in November.
Five weeks left before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't run, although I do run, fighting everywhere for good candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their power by using all necessary means, and we see vileness and abominations.
They do not care who they offend, through whom they must move, to gain power and control, which is what they want — power and control, but we do not intend to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he argues, have set out the objective of “defying and obstructing”.
“And you have been watching this for the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “evil, mean, ugly and lying”.
He referred to the Senate Legal Committee by mentioning Democratic Senator Diane Feynstein, which caused loud cries from the hall.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you allow the contents of this document to leak?
Mmm... mmm... what document?
The tongue of the body betrayed it, and I have never seen the language of the body so contrary to the words.”
The Labour Party is no longer an organization with different views.
It does not tolerate those who express their opinion
When the Momentum activists in my local party put forward a proposal for an air of distrust to me, it was not surprising.
After all, I am the last member of Parliament from the Labour Party, who has not yet been told that we are not welcomed for expressing our views.
Similarly to my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, and Europe is ironic of fate to the issues that Jeremy has not agreed to with previous leaders.
The notification of the Nottingham Eastern Labour Assembly on Friday stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of the time since my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Labour Party, the evening Friday meetings of the GC were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today's tone is not in line with many meetings, and the promise of a “more human and soft” policy has long been forgotten if it ever was.
The fact that the Labour Party does not allow for differences of opinion is becoming increasingly evident, and each opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the Party.
It began shortly after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues whose political perspective I had previously considered similar to my own began to expect me to radically change my views and take a position with which I would never agree — whether national security or the EU single market.
Every time I make a public statement — no matter what I say — the social networks are subject to a series of insults calling for the abolition of elections condemning the policies of the centre or claiming that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And it doesn't just happen to me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me still tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who face daily attacks on sexual or racist grounds, but never retreat.
Most of all in this policy, it is disappointing that such a number of insults have become a norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the “wide church”, and with every willful lack of confidence or change in party selection rules is already taking place.
In the past two years, I have received many recommendations calling me to sit quietly and cut my speech, and then I will be fine.
But that's not why I came into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Force 32 years ago as a school student, outraged by the disdainful attitude of the Government of Tetcher, which literally broke out in my class, I have tried to uphold the highest standard of public service for those who need it most — whether it be the work of a local MP or a government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, I have not done so in past elections.
No one in Notting East could misinterpret my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this vote on Friday, I would like to say that our country is so hard to move towards Brexit, which is guaranteed to bring economic, industrial and public damage, and I do not understand the desire of some to waste their time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only audience I'd like to address is not Nottingham Momentum, but my voters, whether they're lobbyists or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats to the abolition of election results or political desirability will prevent me from acting as I deem necessary in your best interests.

Er 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Er comes first
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result, but without a doubt, Er deserved a triumph in this surprisingly interesting match of the Prime Minister of Tennant.
They now head a table, the only unbeatable team of tens.
After all, all thanks to their excellent protection, as well as their ability to choose the right moment, which gave the receiving team and coach Peter Merci the full right to be pleased.
“All this time we were tested for strength, and we are still invincible, so I have no reason to grieve,” commented Peter Merci.
Robin Christy, Melrose: “It’s worth paying tribute to Er, they have done better for us.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Freser Klimo led Er forward, but the yellow card released to the Scottish player Rory Hughes allowed Melrose to move forward, and Jason Baggott caught up with the unfulfilled attempt.
The Klimo increased Er's break from the fine before, right in the middle of the game, earned a point and then took a single attempt at a break to account for 17-5 in favour of Er.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, carried out by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long interruption due to the serious injury of Ruard Knott, who had been dissipated, and after his re-entry, Er moved on because of the attempt by Stafford McDawwell, an attempt by Climo.
The current Captain Er was then given a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the rivals to pay another player for the unfulfilled attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the period of fierce pressure.
However, the landlords returned, and when Struan Hatchinson received the yellow card for intercepting the Klimo without the ball from the fine line, McFerson made the touchdown behind the incoming mole Er.
Klimo realized the advantage by not stopping almost the second time, after Kyle Row was struck by David Armstrong and sent extreme attacker Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt by the field owners.
The Star Still Game is about to start a new career in a restaurant business
Still Game Ford Kiran is about to start work in the hotel industry: it became known that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show, the script he's writing to, and he's doing it with a long-time comedy partner named Greg Hemfil.
Duett announced that the next ninth series would be the last on the show, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Kraiglang.
According to official information, he is Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this information, although the source Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan was planning to participate in a “promising restaurant business” in Glasgow.
Our Sea: Bolivia's landlocked hope that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
The sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
There are blue flags hanging on public buildings.
Sea-sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with slogans: “We have our right.
It is our duty to return it.”
Throughout Bolivia, the landlocked region is still a living memory of the coastline lost in favour of Chile as a result of the 19th century ' s bloody conflict because of resources; and the desire to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes may have been the most courageous in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting an international court ruling, which will take place on 1 October as a result of five years of debate.
“Polivia has the energy, the spirit of unity and the balance of mind and, of course, there is a positive outcome here,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will observe the decision-making process in the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will be able to support Bolivia ' s statement that after decades of intense negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign access to the sea of Bolivia.
Evo Morales, charismatic president of the indigenous peoples of Bolivia, who is fighting for re-election next year, is also looking forward to a decision on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he asserted at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favour of Bolivia, and if it does, it will change little.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no authority to manage Chilean territory and has already stated that it will not affect the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the ruling of the International Court of Justice was rendered only six months after the last arguments had been heard indicates that the case “was not complex”, says Pas Zarat, Chilean expert on international law.
In the last four years, Bolivia’s case has not progressed, but it has been delayed all the time.
“The current administration of Bolivia has used the issue of access to the sea for criminal purposes,” Zarat said.
She said that the military rhetoric of Morales had destroyed Chilean's last kindness.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions afterwards.
These two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Velce, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagrees that a court decision was rendered too quickly.
Monday will provide Bolivia with “an excellent opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and the chance to end “the 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit”, he argues.
Kalzadilla also disagrees with the fact that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, is using the naval problem as a political leverage.
“Bolivia will never abandon its right of access to the Pacific,” he argues.
“The decision of the court is an opportunity to make sure that we have to go beyond our past.”
North Korea states that there will be no nuclear disarmament until it is able to trust the United States of America
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yeon-ho states that his country will never go to destroy its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at a meeting of the UN Genass Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at the Singapore summit among its leaders.
His comments are received as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gradually returns to the path of the resumption of deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Chen Yin in Singapore.
Ri asserts that the dream that the long US sanctions and objection to the declaration of the end of the Korean war will ever put the North on its knees is utopia.
Washington is afraid to approve this declaration if Pyongyang does not take significant steps towards disarmament in the first place.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump of the United States want to hold the second summit.
But the skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security, is widespread.
Pompey plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Tram.
Paris fashion shows are showing the newest line of massive headgears that promise to appear in the mass sales, and they will carry them right next to you.
If you want to add a hat to your collection or completely protect yourself from sunlight, there's no need to look for anything else.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a mass of unusual headgears that are part of their SS19 collection and blinded visitors to Fashion Week in Paris.
This summer, extremely impractical hats won the popularity of Instagram subscribers, and designers decided to send their snogs to the podium.
Valentino’s distinguishing copy: the main beige, decorated with broad featherslike fields, was painted on the heads of models.
Other massive accessories included embellished with precious stones of the watermelon, a hat of a sorcerer, and even a pineapple, but all these headgears were not designed to warm their heads in cold weather.
Tom Brown also presented the world with a collection of strange masks, which had to take place on the eve of Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks would be sewn up and more like the portrait of Gannibal Lecter than the work of the boxes.
One of the pieces resembled underwater swimming with tube and protective glasses, while the other looked like ice cream.
If you're a fashion admirer, you're lucky.
Fashion critics predict that these huge hats have every chance of getting into mass sales — right next to you.
The huge-sized hats follow the heel of La Bomba, a straw hat with two feet wide skirts, all of which have been worn, from Rianna to Emily Ratakovski.
The cool label that released this extremely impractical hat, which has gained so much popularity on social networks, has produced and sent out another huge accessory — a solo beach bag, almost as big as the model wearing it in the bathing suit itself.
The orange bag from the ref with a white leather handle and a handkerchief from the refinery became a vivid copy of the Jacques La Riviera SS19 collection on Fashion Week in Paris.
Selebritist Luke Armitage explains the publication FEMAIL: “I think big hats and beach bags will appear in the mass sale the following summer, and since the designer has already produced such a furry, it would be very difficult to ignore the demand for huge accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is of great importance to the citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland continue with the tradition of brilliant education, once again confirmed in 2018: the outstanding results of the examinations demonstrated individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other social and significant disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 pupils are enrolled throughout Scotland and seek to provide a higher level of services for pupils and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their pupils for the further attainment of higher education, their chosen careers, and their status as citizens of the world.
As part of the education sector, which is responsible for the development and implementation of the individual school programme, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of school choices.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you call to his mind.
If you speak to him in his own tongue, you turn to his heart."
This is a convincing indication that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relations with and trust citizens of other countries.
This year's final examination shows that the languages take leadership positions in the league tables and have the highest score of independent school examinations.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages received the highest score of “A”.
Data from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of students received “A” in Mandarin (the Chinese language), while 72 per cent of students from German, 69 per cent of students from French and 63 per cent of Spanish students also received “A”.
This proves that foreign languages in independent schools in Scotland are clearly considered vital for children and young people in the future.
At present, language subjects have the same demand as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in independent schools and other educational institutions.
A survey carried out by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 revealed that 17 per cent of the reasons why employers had difficulty filling vacant jobs had a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly becoming a key to a successful future career for young people.
Given that more promising jobs require language knowledge, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what profession the student chooses, if he learns the second language, in the future he will gain a real advantage by taking on another additional skill that will be useful to him throughout his future life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who knows several foreign languages competitive advantages.
According to YouGov, in which more than 4,000 British adults participated in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak well enough in a foreign language to support the conversation and the French language was the only bilingual language — 15 per cent of respondents speak it.
That is why investing in language education is so important now.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those with developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In schools in Scotland, there is quite a wide variation in language, which is taught — each school has its own set of languages.
A number of schools are concentrated in more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important to Britain in the light of the future development of the country by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, in independent schools there will always be a choice of several languages with teachers whose members are experts in these languages.
The independent schools of Scotland seek to create a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills needed to achieve success, regardless of what the future holds for them.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages remain vital in the global business environment in terms of the future of the country ' s development, so this should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages must indeed be regarded as “the skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, which provides diversity and advantages for Scottish youth.
Il faut bien only ferre.
John Edwards, Director of the Board of Independent Schools of Scotland
LeBron debuts at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The huge expectations of fans to see LeBron James perform for the first time in Los Angeles Lakers are almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in a pre-season Sunday match against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
But we still have to figure out how long it takes him to play.
“More than one and less than forty-eight”, replied Walton on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited time.
After training early this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games in Lakers' schedule.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare for the season,” the game responds.
Trampa Pre-election Race in Western Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is beginning the wave of election meetings tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned Trump meetings next week, including friendly Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote on the candidacy proposed by him for the senior judge had been postponed, Trump sought the support of the forthcoming intermediate elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the vote was to be held in November.
At what time will the Trump meeting be held in West Virginia this evening, and how can we view it online?
The meeting with Trampo, Willing, West Virginia, will be held at 19:00, Eastern Time, today, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch the Trump meeting with Western Virginia voters online on live YouTube.
Tramp will probably speak at this week's hearings to appoint his candidate, Brett Kavano, to serve as chief judge, and the proposal by Tramp of this candidacy has triggered a series of negative reactions, as Kavano was charged with sexual harassment, and the vote that was due to be held in the Senate will be postponed until the week of the FBI's investigation.
But the main goal of this action is to help the Republicans in the November elections to increase the electoral pace.
President Trump's campaign is thus aimed at helping these five meetings next week to “activate volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives”, Reuters writes.
“Congress control is so important for its agenda that the President must visit as many states as possible, as we are entering the tense election campaign season,” says the Spokesman of the Trump election campaign, who has refused to be called, Reuters reports.
The action planned today at Wesbanco Arena in Willinga may attract supporters from "Ogayo and Pennsylvania, and attract media attention from Pittsburgh," says West Virginia Metro News.
A visit to West Virginia by Trammm on this Saturday is already the second visit to this state in the last month, since it has been here that he received the advantage of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
The Trump is trying to help the Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morris, who is behind the polls.
“The fact that, in order for Morris to get ahead of the polls, the president must come is a bad sign for Morris himself,” says Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia (cit from Reuters).
Raider Cup 2018: The U.S. Assembly shows willingness to fight and gives hope on Sunday for couples' competitions
After three unilateral sessions, the Saturday game by two may have been just what Ryder's Cup needed.
The moving initiative is an outstandingly invented sports concept, but it is played by players, and it is especially expressed in such competitions.
So who has the initiative?
“They had a six-point advantage, and now four, so I think it’s a small initiative for us,” said Jordan Spit leaving.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of four points, and another twelve points.
The Americans, according to Spista, feel the “wind in sails” and have reason to hold the spirit on high, not least because of the form of Spist and Justin Thomas playing together all day long, and each can boast three out of four points.
The sleep was consistent between you and the Grin before you set a personal example.
The winning shouts grew louder as his round lasted, driving the decisive ball in the hole, closing the match when Thomas and he and Thomas joined two by two.
His stroke, which gave them a victory in the 15th moon game, was met with a similar ad, one of the ones who spoke of his belief in a chance for the American team.
“We need to gather with all our strengths and focus only on our game,” commented the Spit.
That's all the players left now.
Go through 18 holes and become winners.
The only players who have earned more points in the past two days than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, who have undoubtedly entered the history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe got four out of four, and they don't seem to know the mistakes.
Molywood was the only couple who didn't have a god on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the gods on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and, again, Friday morning.
Such a series and how their energy seems to circulate between them and unsuspecting fans, strengthens their belief that Sunday will not win, and when the sun is hidden beyond the Le Golf National horizon, there will be no more famous player to conquer Europe than Flintwood or Molinari.
It would be nice if they were both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is premature to speak of the glory of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson had a quick fight with Sergio García, the morning hero of four games when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The gods and the two double gods at the first nine holes kicked out a Spanish man and stole a hole from which they could never get out.
So on Sunday, no one will help you get out of your pit.
Thus, it is exciting to watch four balls and four players play by interacting with the couples, the councils they exchange, and who deliberately silence, and how the strategy can change into a single moment.
Until now, Europe has played better than a team, and has made a significant breakthrough in the last day, but this session of the Quartet has also shown that the U.S. gatherers have all the strength to fight, in which some, particularly in America, have doubted.
On the final day of the Raider Cup, Europe is running 10-6.
Europe will have a tangible advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after the end of Saturday's four-ball and four-way games with the advantage of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duet, Tommy Flintwood and Francesco Molinari, led the fight against two victories over the fighting Tiger Woods to bring the Le Golf National account to four points.
The European team, Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to recover a trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the U.S. team's mistakes in morning games by winning the 3-1 bill.
The United States has shown more resistance in the fours by winning two matches, but they have not been able to close the account gap.
Jim Ferrick's command takes eight points out of the 12 Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Flintwood is the first European novelist to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, who received the name Mollywood after a sensational weekend, became only the second couple to win four points in the first four matches in the history of Kubek Ryder.
By destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in four games, they were then wonderfully united to win the fallen spirit of Woods and the American novel Brian Dechebmo with an even stronger 5/4.
Woods, who had spent two Saturdays, showed periodic flashes, but now he lost 19 out of the 29 matches in four games, and four in seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who died in the morning at four, returned to his partner, Henry Stanson, on Thursday, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepku with a score of 2/1 covering the first and third places in the world.
For Europe, the game has not been an easy and pleasant walk of refreshing day to the south-west of Paris.
A three-time champion by Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas on Saturday, two points became an American reference point.
They won a strong 2/1 win against the Spanish John Ram and Ayan Polter in four games and came back later to play Polter and Rory McCillroy with a score of 4/3 in fours, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Kubak Ryder was the team pulled out of the four-point stand alone, given that the Ferrika team, as masters, had to play for nothing in order to hold the trophy.
However, after two days of retention, the Sunday counterattack looks as if it is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea said that “quickly” would not be disarmed unilaterally without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated at the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions increased the lack of confidence in the United States and that his country would under no circumstances give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yon Ho stated at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had adopted “practical measures of goodwill” last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of a nuclear range and the obligation not to increase stockpiles of nuclear weapons or to develop nuclear technology.
“We don’t see a symmetrical response from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we will not be able unilaterally to take action on disarmament first.”
While Ri repeated the North Korean complaints of Washington's “phased” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for its gradual steps, his statement seemed important in the sense that it had not rejected unilateral denuclearization without control, as was done by Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Chen Yin and Donald Trump at the first summit in history between the current President of the United States and the North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June; then Kim promised to start moving towards the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump promised security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea sought to officially complete the Korean war 1950-53, but the United States stated that Pyongyang must first renounce its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resists calls for the reduction of severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that “the primary issue of denuclearization should be denuclearized” and increase the level of pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its objective and even oppose the “declaration of the end of war”, says Ri.
“The notion that sanctions can put us on our knees is the utopian dream of people who don’t know us.
But the real problem is that the ongoing sanctions reinforce our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Tram, which the US leader mentioned at the United Nations early in the week.
Instead, the Minister focused on three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Muno Jae In in the past five months and added: “If the issue of denuclearization were South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be such a deadlock”.
However, Ri's tone was very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's missile targeting on the U.S. mainland was inevitable after Mr. President Trump called Kim "the suicide rocket".
This year, at UN Trump, which threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said that much remained to be done, and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea was disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not specify any time-frame for the process: “Whether it is two years, three years or five months is irrelevant”.
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue actively and necessarily until we see a complete, final and confirmed denuclearization”.
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with a view to preventing the financing of Pyongyang ' s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri in the coutures of the UN General Assembly Summit and reported that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
He left Pyongyang in July, said that progress had been made, but within a few hours of that visit, North Korea sentenced him to “bandit requirements”.
North Korea promised to dismantle the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States, for its part, took “appropriate measures”.
He said that Kim had told him that the “appropriate measures” he was talking about were security assurances that Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to relax in special courses
This year's new course, introduced at Harvard University, has helped all students learn more about sleeping and fighting the chauvinist culture of the continuous consumption of caffeine in order to keep up the night for the spring.
One academic found that the most successful students in the world often had no idea how to care for themselves.
Charles Chaseler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a clinic specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believed was the first in the United States.
After its opening, he had been fueled by the idea of introducing such a course, with a preliminary report on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning processes.
“At the end of my report, a girl came to me and said, ‘It’s a pity that I learned about this only now that I’m almost finished.’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep — which surprised me,” he said.
The course offered to students for the first time this year describes how sleep habits contribute to academic and sports achievement and how it improves the overall self-esteem of people.
Paul Barreyra, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University Health Service, said that the university had decided to introduce this course after it had been found that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The class lasts for one hour, and students perform a number of interactive assignments.
One section of the course offers an image of a room in a dormitory, where students pressured on coffee cups, curtains, coaches, and books receive information on how each of these activities and substances — coffee, light, which also causes a lack of sleep — affect sports results and how important it is to get enough sleep every day.
In another section, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
An interactive campus map encourages participants to think about their daily lives.
“We understand that these classes do not change the behavior of students at once.
But we believe that they have the right to know how any other person has the right to know about, for example, how smoking affects his health," added Professor Chasesler.
He said that a false sense of pride for being able to “smoke all night”, was still sufficiently widespread, and modern technologies, just as increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is becoming a problem.
He said that a sufficient amount of sleep of good quality was the “secret weapon” of a student to combat stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to combat excess weight, since malnutrition was a means of spreading the brain into hunger, forcing him to constantly experience hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who was studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chasesler develop a course by attending one of his first years in Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to distribute this information throughout the campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all postgraduate students to have a similar curriculum before entering a competitive educational institution.
Professor Chasesler recommends that students set up a alarm clock to warn you that you should sleep and wake up and remember the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps that violate human bioethm and cause problems with falling asleep.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga brings victory over Gerard's team
Rangers survived another sad exit meeting, as Dolly Menga scored Stephen Gerrard's uncuffed team with a 1-0 count in Livingstone.
The Ibrox team hoped to win its first victory after winning score of 4:1 in St. Johnston in February, but Gary Holt's team defeated only the second out of 18 games as a manager, leaving his team behind eight points, giving a light victory to the Harts team, the leaders of the Scottish Premier League.
Menga killed seven minutes before the break, and Rangers, who had lost the power of the spirit, did not seem to be going to balance the bill.
While Rangers is now in sixth place, Livingstone is in third place, and only Hibernian is in the proportion of the head killed.
And Rangers may face additional problems after the linear judge, Kalumu Spence, had to heal the wound on his head after some item was dropped from the guest sector.
Gerard made eight replacements on the team that went through Er in the semifinal for the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, in turn, went with the same line of Livia 11, which increased the break-up with Harts last week, and he would be pleased to see his well-managed team tighten their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have been in charge of the sword, but Livingstone survived far more when the ball hit them.
They should have killed the goal in just two minutes, when the first transmission to Meng Scott Pittman stopped Allan McGregor, but the half-protector took the chance.
Kigan Jacobs took a fine against the Captain of Craig Halkett's team, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgo, only managed to send the ball to the next strike.
Rangers intercepted control, but there seems to be more hope in the last third than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was convinced that he was to strike a fine at the forty-fifth minute when he and Steven Lawless faced a collision, but Judge Stephen Thompson disagreed with the Colombian statement.
Rangers made only two strokes in the first time, but the former doorman of Aybrox, Liam Kelly, was hardly concerned about the impact of Lassan Kulibali's head, and the weak impact of Ovi Ejaria.
Although the first goal of Livia, which was killed for 34 minutes, may not have been in line with the game, no one can deny that they earned it solely by their own work.
Again, Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' game of standard.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who tried hard to hand the ball over to Menga for completion.
Gerard began acting on a break when he switched the Culibali to Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately resulted when the final half-protector gave his pass to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran off from his line to intercept.
But Livingstone continued to involve the guests in the game they intended to play with Lithgo and Halket, constantly making long deals.
Holt's team tried to widen the gap in the final stages, but McGregor was able to block Jacobs before Lithgo gave up the field angle.
Rangers, Glenn Middleton, once again demanded a fine after he faced Jacobs, but Thompson refused again.
Almanac: Geiger counter inventor
And now the page of our Almanac on Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, German physicist Johannes Wilhelm Gage was born that day.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity — an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as Geiger's counter.
Having become one of the basics of science, Geiger's meter has also become one of the foundations of a popular culture, and this has been reflected in the 1950s 'Coronado Colony, 'Royal Coronado', 'Roygers and Dale Evans' 'Cowboy-like' film, which seems to be not like scientists, in the main roles:
Man: What is this thing?
Rogers: “This Geiger counter is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can really hear the effects of the atoms generated by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: "Look! Now you hear!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, didn't live just a few days before he was 63 years old.
But his invention, named after his author, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” anomalous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” abnormally growing cells and kill them
Part of the vaccine treatment is to teach the immune system to recognize anomalous cells.
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions.
As a result, cells have the ability to “see” the type of protein that is characteristic of many cancers, then cells must be re-treated.
The test vaccine shows promising results for patients with different cancers.
One patient who was introduced this vaccine and whose immune system has learned to recognize anomalous cells has had ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions, after which modified cells can “see” HER2 protein, characteristic of many cancers, and then reintroduction of the modified cells to the patient.
Professor J. Berzofski, U.S. National Cancer Research Institute, Wifdesda, Maryland, states: “The results we received suggest we have a very promising vaccine”
Professor Berzofski explains: HER2 “stimulates the growth of several cancers”, including breast cancer, ovaries, lung and colorectal cancer.
A similar method was successfully applied to leukemia treatment, consisting of the removal of immune cells from patients and their “training” to the effect on cancer cells.
Kanye West spoke in defence of Trump in the MAGA cap after his appearance at SNL.
Everything went wrong.
Kanye West was enlightened at the Saturday concert, at which he spoke in defence of President Donald Trump, who claimed that he would resume the post in 2020.
After performing his third song, entitled “The Ghost City”, which he performed, he wore the hat “Make America Great Again”, the performer spoke against the Democrats and supported Trump.
"Very often I talk to white people, and they ask me, "How can you support the Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," said the performer.
The SNL channel made a parody show with Matt Damon in the main role in which the Hollywood star ridiculed the testimony of Brett Kavano to the Senate Judicial Committee on Christine Blacy Ford's allegations of sexual harassment.
There was no indication on television of the mob's outrage with West's speech, but this video was downloaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is now unclear whether Rock tried to mock West with this step.
In addition, West complained to the public that behind the scenes, his cap was ridiculed.
"They hopped on me behind the stage.
They say don't go out in that hat.
They really touched me!
Washington Examiner quoted him as saying: “And they also said that my position was not cool.”
West continues: “Do you want to know what’s not cool? Put on superman’s coat so no one can tell you what to do. Do you want the world to continue to develop?
Then you need love."
His comments, at least twice, attracted the audience's attention, the members of the SNL acting group seemed sore, and one person said to the publication, “The whole studio was silent”.
Westa was last invited as a replacement for Ariane Grande's singer, whose ex-boyfriend, Reper McMiller, died a few days earlier.
Many were puzzled by the performance of the Westham song “I Love It” in the Perrier bottle suit.
West received the support of TPUSA Kandis Turner, the head of the conservative group, who wrote on Twitter: “One of the bravest people: SAVED FOR THE SUPPORT OF MANY”.
Karen Hunter, who is leading the show, wrote on Twitter that West was just “the one who is and is absolutely wonderful”.
“However, I do not want to support anyone (buying music, clothing or otherwise supporting his creativity) who, in my opinion, shares and disseminates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
So are we," she said.
Prior to the start of the show, the rapper announced in Twitter that he had changed his name by saying that he was now “formally known as Kanye West”.
He's not the first artist to change his name and walk on the feet of Diddy, also known as Puff Duddie, Puffy and P. Diddy.
His colleague, Rapper Snoop Doga, originally had the name Snoop Lyon, and another example was, of course, the author who recently became a legend, the Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, and then to an artist formerly known as Prince.

Keith Harrington's Game of Thrones Star Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Keith Harrington is known for his role as the sword-breathing John Snow in the cruel medieval fantasy series of HBO Games.
Nevertheless, a 31-year-old actor recently bitterly criticized the stereotype of macho, said that such characters often suggest to young people that to be respected, you must be cruel.
In his interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said that he believed that something had gone wrong and wondered how to solve the toxic masculinity problem in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his colleague in the Game of Thrones film, Rose Leslie, a crazier, admitted that he was “very indifferent” to the problem.
“I personally take this question quite seriously: where did we go wrong with the perception of courage?” asked the actor.
“Why do we teach teens that we have such a problem today?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for this explosion of toxic courage due to too much muscular characters.
The actor continues: “What is born and what is acquired?
What do they teach on TV and on the streets that makes young men feel that they have to show only one aspect of courage?
I think it's really one of the biggest problems of our time, and the question is, how can we change that?
Because today, with young people, there really is something wrong.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any of the games of the thrones after the show ended in the next summer, stating that he had “ended with battles and horses”.
Since November, Keith will play a major role in Sam Shepard's "Real West" re-recording film producer and his brother, the rapist.
The actor recently announced that he believed that meeting with Rose’s wife was the best game of thrones for him.
“I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and my future life,” the actor said.
Rose played the Gamerist, the subject of the passion of the character Keith Jon Snow in a fantasy series awarded by Emmy.
The couple observed a wedding in June 2018 at Leslie's estate in Scotland.
China reported a 14 per cent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of people with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country are suffering from these diseases.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were recorded.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease was sexually transmitted, indicating a change in past trends.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
However, the number of HIV infections was almost reduced to zero, Chinese health representatives stated at a conference in Yunnan Province.
The number of people with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000 each year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community of China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but LGBT discrimination is still widespread.
Studies confirm that 70 to 90 per cent of men who have sexual relations with men are eventually married to women because of the conservative values of the country.
In many cases, the transmission of diseases is due to insufficient protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Government of China has pledged universal access to medicines against HIV as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters refutes information leaks on the guilt of Republican senators, complaining of “a dangerous lie” and “a conspiracy theory”
On Saturday, U.S. Parliamentary member Maxine Waters rejected charges that one of her staff had posted personal information to three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia's lawmakers' pages.
A Democrat from Los Angeles claims that claims were falsified by “ultural” experts and websites.
“False, lying and even more lying,” says Waters in his Twitter account.
The published information is reported to include U.S. Senators' home addresses and telephone numbers, Lindsay Graham, South California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person at the Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on sexual harassment charges against the Supreme Court candidate Bretta Kavano.
The leak occurred some time after three senators questioned Kavano.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the messages was linked to Waters' office, and disclosed information on Waters' staff, Hill reported.
“This unsubstantiated allegation is totally false,” Waters assures.
“My personnel, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these frauds, were not in any way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded assertion is a complete lie.”
Waters' statement immediately sparked criticism on the Internet, including from former White House Spokesman Ari Fleischer.
“It’s an angry denial, ” writes Fleischer.
“This means that the author has a temperament that is not suitable for the Congress.
When you're accused of something, what didn't you do, why are you mad?
And you don't have to justify yourself.
And you don't have to dig in the prosecution's motives either.
We must remain calm and cold.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction with the criticism of the Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused him of being too angry during the Thursday hearings.
Omar Navarro, a candidate for the Republicans, who has been ballotting in the place of Waters in the intermediate elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“If that’s true, it’s very important, ” he writes.
Waters states in his statement that her office warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about these frauds.
“We will ensure that criminals are found,” she writes, “and that they are held legally responsible for all their actions that may be destructive and dangerous to all and every one of my staff.”
Johnny English strikes again — a weak parody on a spy named Rowen Atkinson
Today, it has become a tradition to find the meaning of Brexit in any new film in which the United Kingdom is involved; it is also the new parody spy franchise, Agent Johnny English, which began in 2003 and continued in 2011 with Agent Johnny English: reloading.
Will the self-iron picture with the "evidently we're all shit" of a new attempt at national exports?
In any case, the pupe of profane Johnny English with a rubber face has gained his right to chaos for the second time — his name is more than suggesting that it is a wide-screen comic design designed for the non-English cinematographic audience.
The hero, of course, is a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims on the glamorous lanes, received a little Clouseau, Mr. Bin's drawings and a portion of this guy who made one single note to Chariots of Fire in London in 2012 at the opening ceremony of the Olympics.
Initially, this character was created on the basis of the identity of the traveller and the mysterious “international” Atkinson, once played in the now forgotten television commercial Barclaycard, in which the hero leaves behind complete chaos.
In this last issue, JE has one or two pleasant moments.
I loved the scene when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the shovels crawled on his helmet.
Yes, it shows Atkinson's gift to the physical performance of comedy scenes, but the humor itself seems rather weak and strangely unnecessary, especially because “serious” cinemas such as “Agent 007” and “mission impossible”, are now confidently offering comedy as elements.
It's a feeling that humor is designed for children, not adults, and for me, Johnny Ingles is not as inventive and appropriate as Atkinson's movies about Mr. Bin.
The constant message now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker penetrated the top secret British spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of the on-call agent Kevin Eldon here, unfortunately, an episode role.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, a hard-headed and hard-working figure already suffering from a great political non-popularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything he can for a Quazi-Tereza-Mey character, but there is nothing in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that since every active spy has been compromised, she will have to resign.
And there is Johnny English himself on the stage with his own character, who now works as a schoolteacher in a sweatshop, but also provides informal lessons on secret operating work: there are a few good jokes, because English offers the skills of a “year” spy academy.
English is returning to Whitehall for emergency training and is reunited with his former insensitive friend Baff, whom Ben Miller is playing this time.
Baff is now a married man who submits to the commander of the submarine, the role of the happy hockey club, in which Vicky Pepperdin loses a little bit.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game because her Majesty's secret service has made terrible mistakes, and they're facing the beautiful annual woman of Ophelia Bulletov in the performance of Olga Kurilenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously placed under the charm of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems — the sinister Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Baff are starting their image of farce jokes: disguised as officers, they're starting a French restaurant; they're creating chaos, smuggling themselves into Volt's luxury yacht; English is producing a complete anarchy, trying to use virtual reality to get to know the interior of Volt's house.
All of these scenes, of course, are a sweet and embarrassing invention, but there is something very childish about all of this.
Pretty moderate stuff.
And, as with other movies by Johnny Inglis, I couldn't help but think: can't the British film industry really give Rowen Atkinson a role that's commensurate with his talent?
Leiborists deny that they are developing a plan to reduce the working week of the British to four days for a five-day salary
The Labour Party Jeremy Corbin is going to consider a radical plan that says the British will work four days a week, but will receive payment in five days.
The party reportedly wants company leaders to provide savings to workers resulting from the artificial intelligence revolution by providing them with an additional weekend.
This would allow staff to enjoy three days of weekends at the same salary.
Sources reported that the idea was “entering” on the party's economic agenda and would help the people to take sides with the workers.
The Trade Union Congress approved the transition to a four-day working week so that workers could benefit from a changing economy.
The Sunday Times said that the high-ranking source of the Labour Party is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“This will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is our goal, which is in line with the party's approach to changing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this desire is not currently approved by the majority of the Labour Party.
A representative of the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy or is not considered by a party”.
Tene Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to specify his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to remove power from the “lessy directors” and“ speculators” of utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current watershed shareholders may not get their full share back, as the Labour Government can “calculate” on the basis of alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the plans to include employees in the boards of directors of companies and the establishment of Inclusive Outnership Funds to transfer 10 per cent of the capital of private sector firms to workers who could receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are saying "60 minutes", whether the FBI investigation into Cavanaugh can change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavano delayed a final vote on his appointment as a senior judge for at least a week and asked whether the findings of the agency could encourage any of the Republican senators to support Kavano.
In an interview on Sunday, a 60-minute reporter, Scott Pelley, interviewed the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham, whether the FBI can find anything to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Yes, of course,” replied Kennedy.
"When I went to the meeting, I said I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that, and I came up with this information, and I said, "Did you do it?
His answer was firm, clear and unequivocal.”
But Graham's opinion in the vote remained constant.
“I have made a firm determination about Brett Cavanaugh, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments, by the force of action comparable to what is dynamite,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, turning to Christine Blacy Ford.
“Neither one of the witnesses was able to corroborate these facts.
It's been a story for 36 years.
And I didn't see anything new about it.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has he done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be the Global Citizen Festival (the Festival of Peace Citizens), an annual musical event featuring an impressive star formation with an equally impressive mission — the end of poverty worldwide.
It has been the seventh year of the Festival of Peace Citizens as tens of thousands of people flocking to a large patch of Central Park, but not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendez, but also to tell about the purpose of the event: the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The festival of world citizens opened in 2012 is a continuation of a global project on poverty, which is being carried out by an international group of human rights defenders who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if you are not ready to pay for the VIP ticket), you had to participate in volunteering or send an electronic letter to the world leader, make a telephone call or do any other or other meaningful action to help raise awareness of your goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was the Festival of Peace Citizens in 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is there an idea of paying people free to visit a concert really convincing fellow citizens to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "crylativeism" when people believe they make real changes by signing an online petition or sending messages to Twitter?
Global Citizens organizers claim that since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” held by its supporters have been recorded at the festival, which pursue many different objectives.
It is recalled that these actions have led world leaders to promise more than $37 billion, which should affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group sounded 390 commitments and pledges made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or collected.
The Panel estimates that the funds provided direct assistance to nearly 649 million people around the world.
One of the most important commitments is the title The Power of Nutrition: the British investment partnership and the implementation specialists committed to “helping children to fully realize their potential”, promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help put an end to malnutrition in the district, which was done after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British Government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, such as you, we can make social injustices about the lack of nutrition in past history,” said Ambassador Power of Nutrition Tracy Ulman at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions had been taken calling on Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the Government had announced funding for the Food Force project, which would cover 5 million women and children through food improvement activities.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the festival website: “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The organizers of Global Citizen reply: “This will be a long and difficult path, on which we will stumble and fall from time to time.
But like in the big civil rights and apartheid movement, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendez, Cardie B, Jeanelle Mone are some of the artists who will perform this year's New York event, and its leaders will be Deborah-Lee Fernès and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use the Navy for the “block” to prevent Russian energy exports: Minister of the Interior
U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke stated that Washington could use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including in the Middle East, if necessary.
Zinke argues that the presence of Russia in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate Government, is a pretext for studying new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are certain ways and means to address this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, is able to ensure the openness of maritime routes and, if necessary, the blockade so that their energy does not enter the market,” the Minister said.
Zinke approached the participants of the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that would position itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He then compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they were actually the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less efficient use and replacement of fuel”, says the Minister, calling Russia “a pony with a trick,” whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements were made because the Trump administration had been tasked with increasing exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe by replacing Russia with a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials from the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step out of the “necessary” project of the North Stream-2 pipeline, which, according to Trampa, Berlin has made Moscow a “swift”.
In Moscow, it has been repeatedly stressed that the North Stream-2 project, worth $11 billion, which should double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's violent resistance to the project is due to economic causes and is an example of unfair competition.
“I stress that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position created a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
German industries through the Federation of German Industry (BDI) called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third State interferes with our supply of energy, this poses a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), following the recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren will study closely the possibilities of balloting for the presidency in 2020.
Senator Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts, said on Saturday that she would study carefully the possibilities of balloting for the post of President after the interim elections.
At a meeting of the city's Duma in Holiok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider participating in the election race.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and “rest” our broken government, and for that, we need a woman upstairs,” says Warren The Hill.
“After 6 November, I will consider carefully the possibility of balloting for Presidents”.
Warren appreciated President Donald Trump's activities during the meeting, “leading this district in the wrong direction”.
“I am worried to the bone that Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is an open criticism of both Trump and his candidate for Chief Justice Brett Kavano.
In her Twitter on Friday, Warren wrote: “We definitely need to conduct an investigation into the FBI before voting.”
A Thursday survey, however, showed that most of Warren's voters do not think it should be held in 2020.
According to a poll by the Center for Political Studies of the University of Saffolk/Boston Globe, fifty-eight per cent of the “probable” voters of Massachusetts stated that the senator should not be allowed to run.
Thirty-two per cent of respondents, on the contrary, support her plans.
The survey showed that the population was more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38 per cent supported his possible participation in the elections and 48 per cent opposed him.
Other well-known names of Democrats discussed in the context of the 2020 perspective include former Vice President Joe Baden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden argues that he will make a formal decision by January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Paylin described the post-traumatic stress disorder of Trak Paylin at a meeting with Donald Trump voters.
Trek Paylin, 26 years old, joined the army in September and spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
“My son, who has returned home, is now living in the same way as other family members who are suffering from PTSD and injured and our soldiers return with injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Tramp in Tals, Oklahoma.
Paileen called his arrest “white on the eye” and said of her son and other veterans of war: “They are returning to others who are enraged, asking questions, and whether their comrades, soldiers, pilots and any other military who have given their country are equally respected.”
Trak Paylin was arrested on Monday in Vasile, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman by interfering with the situation of violence and the possession of weapons in the state of alcoholic intoxication, according to Dan Bennett, a representative of the Vasily Police Department.
18 states, D.C., support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the district of Colombia support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy, which prohibits the provision of shelter to victims of escape or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and districts submitted an analysis note by the court's consultant on Friday in Washington to support an asylum-seekers who disputed policies.
The full name of the plaintiff in “Grace v. Sessions”, submitted by the American Union of Civil Liberties in August against federal policy, is not disclosed.
The woman claims that her civilian husband “and his sons in a criminal gang” abused her, but on 20 July, U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum.
She was detained in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace say that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are applying for asylum in the United States, as countries with widespread problems with criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy repealed the decision taken by the Immigration Appeals Board in 2014, which allowed immigrants to submit an application for asylum without documents that would save them from domestic violence.
District Attorney General Carl Rasin stated in his statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of State, federal and international law”.
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be examined on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the complaint, and that such prohibition violates this principle”, said the Counsellor ' s communication.
Lawyers also argue that policies prohibiting the entry of immigrants are detrimental to the U.S. economy, stressing that it is this category of citizens that is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provides the necessary labour”.
In June, the Attorney General, Jeff Sachns, ordered immigration judges no longer to provide safe haven to victims of domestic or gang violence.
“The asylum will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political belief”, said Sashns in his statement of 11 June.
This instrument has never been intended to solve absolutely all the problems, even the most serious problems that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate efforts to save the people in Palu: the number of victims doubles in search of survivors
The situation was becoming increasingly difficult for the survivors.
“It’s very hard now,” says 35-year-old Riss Kusum’s mother, comforting her sick child at the evacuation center of the destroyed town of Palu.
“Each minute, the ambulance brings the wounded.
Clean water in great deficit.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes, dig in wet things, and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals affected by the 7.5 earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including the Two Harris, who had had a vertebral fracture and a shoulder, rested near the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated in the open air because they had to leave the room because of continued strong pushes.
He's crying, remembering how a massive earthquake destroyed the room on the fifth floor that he took with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for salvation.
I think I'm stuck in the wreckage of the wall, ” says Harris Associated Press, explaining that his family came to town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife scream and ask for help, and then the silence came.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope they are saved and now they are well.”
US Ambassador accuses China of “invasions” carried out through “advocacy”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in the United States daily, describing the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to a paid supplement of Des Moines Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper edition of Iowa State, with accusations against China in an attempt to interfere with the 6 November US Congress.
Tramp's accusation that Beijing is attempting to intervene in the U.S. elections is a confirmation of the fact that US officials have informed Reuters: there is a new phase in the growing Washington pressure campaign on China.
While it is the norm for foreign Governments to place trade promotion advertising, Beijing and Washington are currently in a state of escalation of trade war, resulting in their balancing tariffs for their countries ' imports.
China's responsible tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were intended to strike exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Thrompa, had been declared by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products in China, claims that Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, says Branstad in an article published in the Sunday magazine Des Moines Register, “now doubles this grass by putting advertising in our own free press”.
“By spreading its propaganda, the Government of China uses the American tradition of freedom of speech and free press to pay for and place advertising in Des Moines Register,” says Branstad.
“However, in newspaper kiosks here on the streets of Beijing, you will hardly hear divergent voices and will not see the true diversity of views the Chinese could learn by learning about China’s alarming economic policy, since local media are under the strict control of the Communist Party of China,” he writes.
He also added that one of the most famous Chinese newspapers had been “scraped” by the proposal to publish his article, although it did not give an exact title to the publication.
Analysts caution: Cavano's delivery of the Republics push women voters off the eve of the interim period
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to stay away and defend the candidacy of Supreme Justice Brett Kavano despite several allegations of sexual violence, and analysts warn that there is a negative reaction, especially on the part of women, which may affect the upcoming intermediate elections.
Emotions over this situation have spread to an extreme, and most Republicans have officially declared that they want to continue to vote.
These things cannot be returned later, ” writes Grant Rier, professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in an article published on Saturday.
Rier doubts that attempts by Senator Jeff Flak (R-Arizona) to investigate the FBI in the last minute will be sufficient to appease angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they won’t forget it tomorrow or November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, Senior Adviser and National Representative of the progressive group MoveOn newspaper Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors chanted “November ahead!” against the Senate, when the Republicans in charge of the Judicial Committee decided to stand for Kavano despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blacy Ford, Mic, reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the limits,” said journalist Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political scientist on the news site.
“People say that the situation is getting tough enough already, and that’s true.
But everything can get worse, especially in terms of female voters in the suburbs and young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they do not like the President, often do not vote.”
Even before Ford publicly testified against a candidate for the Supreme Judge, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed the nomination, this step could lead to a retaliatory response.
“This is already a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steel, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It is not only about voting in committee or final voting or whether Kavano has settled on the bench of defendants, but also about how the Republicans deal with how they relate to them,” said Guy Cecil, Director of the U.S. Priority Group, who is helping to elect Democrats, the news channel.
Nevertheless, the Americans seem to have been somewhat divided about who to believe — Ford or Cavanaugh — and slightly more inclined toward the latter.
The new survey of YouGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents believe Ford's testimony precisely or most likely, while 35 per cent said that they believed Kavano.
In addition, 38 per cent believed that Cavanaugh was likely or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
On the insistence of Flaka, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford, as well as at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford, under oath, testified to the Senate Legal Committee that Cavanaugh, while in a state of intoxication, attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Justice candidate showed her his genitalia at a party during her studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest design of technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the Berners-Lee Solid Open Platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people to access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Burners-Li, he joked that the purpose of Inrupt was to obtain “peaceful domination”.
“We have to do it now,” he says about his startup.
“This is a historic moment”.
The annex uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own “personal online data storage facilities” or SD.
It may contain contact lists, cases, as well as calendars, a music library and other personal and professional data tools.
The application works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify - everything can be used in the same browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of a personal online data repository is that it is fully managed by a user who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “a variety of empowerments through data”.
According to the CEO of John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company has provided resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Burners-Li, Bruce, the IBM security platform, several state-owned developers with whom the project was contracted and the volunteer programmers community.
Since this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not negotiating with Facebook and Google about whether his companies should make radical changes that would make all their business models completely different at the same time.
“We do not ask them permission.”
In his post at Medium, published on Saturday, Burners-Lee wrote that “the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid”.
In 1994, Burners-Li converted the Internet by creating a World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee's voice has been quite influential in the debate on net neutrality.
Even by launching Inrupt, Burners-Li will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet,” said Burners-Li.
Bernard Vann: Church servant rewarded with Victoria's cross during World War I
In the history of the Church of England, only one warrior priest was rewarded with Victoria's cross during World War I, and this event was recorded in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded this award on 29 September 1918 for taking part in an attack on Bellenglise and Leuukur.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, so he never realized that he had won the highest British military prize.
The memorial was solemnly presented to his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was “very symbolic” that the monument was opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London newspaper of 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann conducted his battalion through the St. Kanten channel “in a very thick fog and under strong fire of field tools and machine guns”.
Later, he threw himself on the line of fire and with “the greatest courage” led the group forward and then with one hand dropped the field gun, beating down three soldiers of the unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 — just over a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old grandson of the hero Michael Vann said that “he could hardly do the same heroic thing, but it calms down”.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed a wreath at the end of the parade led by the Imperial Youth Orchestra Brentwood.
Michael Vann said that “it is a great honour for him to take part in the parade” and added that “the virtue of the true hero is confirmed by the support that will be provided by many people”.
The MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, but they were shown Peppa lead instead.
Imagine that you haven't slept all night to see the full Bellator 206, but you haven't seen the main event.
The San José table contained 13 fights, including six main programme battles, were broadcast all night live on 5 British television channels.
At 6: 00 a.m., when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, British fans were stunned to see the Peppa Lead screen.
Some sufferers were not impressed, since they did not sleep until morning just to watch the fighting.
One of the Twitter fans called it a change in the broadcast of a child's cartoon “some sick joke”.
“A government order came out that for six o’clock in the morning this content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to children’s programmes,” said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice President Bellator of Marketing and Communications, when asked why it happened.
"Yes, Pig Peppa.
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said they planned to draw up a schedule in such a way that future fighting could also be seen by viewers from Britain.
“What is the matter with the show again, I think we can solve this issue,” said Coker.
"But it's Sunday, six o'clock in the morning, and we can't solve this until Sunday, and for them it'll be Monday.
But we'll do our best.
Believe me, when the news message was changed, there was a lot of text messages, and all of them were far from friendly.
We tried to solve this problem right away, we thought it was some kind of technical malfunction.
Turns out it wasn't, it was a matter of public importance.
I promise you, next time it won't happen.
We're going to reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for fans, we're trying to increase that number, but we've got a cut.
Yes, it didn't work out well."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt incomplete due to his sexual orientation
Olympian diver Tom Daily says he's growing up feeling worse because of his sexuality, but that's what motivated him to succeed.
A 24-year-old sportsman said that he did not understand that “not all of them were like him” until he went to high school.
Speaking in the first program Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Lavern, he said he spoke about gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He also said that the victory in the Olympics became less disturbing after the child had appeared to him.
Kirsti Young's permanent multi-year show has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley, who was the main guest in the Lavern program, said that he felt “more useless than any of the peers” because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both for boys and girls.
He says: "To this day these feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy have been quite real, but they have given me strength, and I have been able to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was “something” so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
A two-time bronze Olympic medalist became known to LGBT activists and at his presentation at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he expressed his opinion because he was fortunate enough to be able to live an open life without consequences, and wanted to give “hope ” to others.
A three-time world champion said that his feelings for a man, American director Dustin Lance Blacke, whom he met in 2013, “received from him. ”
Last year, Daly married an Oscar laureate who is 20 years older than him, but claims that age difference was never a problem.
“If so many things happen in your life at such a young age, ” he went to his first 14 - year - old Olympics, and his father died of cancer three years later,“ it is difficult to find a peer who has the same radical opposite life experience.
The couple became parents in June, they had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daly, and Daley said that “all his world perceptions” had changed.
“If you asked me last year, it would be all that “I need to win the gold medal”, says the athlete.
“But you know, there are things and more important gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not want to accept what he was dying, and one of his last requests was first-class tickets to the London 2012 competition.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you won’t be there anymore, and you won’t be able to sit there in the front row,’ says Daley.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing did I finally realize that he was not invincible,” the athlete said.
Next year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
“I just knew that it was not a better feeling to dive in front of a bunch of compatriots at the Olympic Games,” he said.
It also inspired him to choose his first favorite song — Proud by Heather Small — which helped him prepare for the Olympics and still enjoy it.
Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, Sunday, 11:15 A.M.
Michelson, not in shape, spent this Saturday at Ryder's cabin on Saturday.
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th match with the Ryder Cup, but he'll have to pull the form to avoid an unpleasant milestone.
Michelson, who played the biennale on record 12 times, was sent by Captain Jim Furik to the bench on Saturday for four balls and fours.
Instead of being at the centre of events, as was often the case in the United States, the five-time winner divided his day between watching the game and working on his own game in the field in the hope of correcting what was bothering him.
Never having the most direct impact, even at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old athlete is not the ideal candidate for the Le Golf National hardway, where the long shelf usually punishes for inaccurate blows.
And if the course itself is not scary enough, Michelson will meet the exact champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari on Sunday at the ninth match, who joined up with the new guy Tommy Flitwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who lost four points in 12 single games, make a bright start, Michelson's match may be decisive.
Ferik expressed confidence in his partner, although he could say something else.
“He fully understood the role assigned to him today, smothered me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” said Ferik.
"He's pretty confident of himself too.
He's been walking the Hall of Fame, and he's done so much for these teams both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I was hoping for more, but it was, and that's how we decided to go.
He wants to be there with everyone."
On Sunday, Michelson will score Nick Foldo's record by the number of matches in Ryder's Cup.
This could mark the end of a career in Ryder's Cup, which never matched the heights of his individual record.
Michelson had 18 victories, 20 defeats, and seven others, although Ferik said his presence had been of little use to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s witty, he’s into people, and he’s a great guy with whom he wants to be,” he explained.
“I think young players had fun with him this week, and it was interesting to see.
Its play is much more than just a game.”
Captain Thomas Bjorn of Europe knows that a great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from his experience that a significant single-level leadership in Kupka Ryder can easily turn to an adverse side.
Dutchman debuted in the match in 1997 in Walderram, where the team headed by Severiano Ballesteros had the advantage of five points over Americans, but overcame the finish line just a little bit ahead with the least difference, winning with an account of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You continue to remind yourself that we had a great advantage in Walderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Walderram where we won, but only so far”, said Bjorn, sealed in a photo after the 2018 class, winning the 5-3 Le Golf National field on Friday and yesterday, which resulted in a score of 10-6.
So history will prove to me and the whole team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow you'll be on full alert.
Go and do what's right.
As long as you don't put your glasses on the table, it's not over yet.
We have a goal, and it's a chance to win a trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I spoke silently, focusing on the 12 players of our team, but we know very well what we stand against – the greatest players in the world.”
Bjorn added: “I would never get over it.
Another test awaits us tomorrow.
Tomorrow, individual statements begin, and this is a different matter.
It's always nice to be with your partner when things are going well, but when you're alone there, you're experiencing all your professional golfer powers.
That's exactly the kind of idea that players need to get to the full tomorrow.
Now the partner remains behind, and he must also make all his efforts.”
Unlike Bjorn, his rival, Jim Ferrick, believes that his individual players will perform better than partners except Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Ferric himself has spent the last few days, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn, before finally losing when Europe had a miracle in Medina.
“I remember every damn word of it”, he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, united his players before the last day.
"We've got 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to get it over faster than in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When the initiative moves in one direction, it exerts great pressure on the match in the middle.
We've built our plan on the game properly, and we've set our guys up as we thought was right, you know, we're going to try to create a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the resistance by meeting with Rory MacElroy at the top-mother with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ayan Polter, as well as other European players at the top of the tournament table.
“I have chosen this group of guys, and in this order, because I believe that they will thus cover all possible disadvantages,” Bjorn said, commenting on their choice of individual players.
Introduction of a new German warship has been postponed again
The new frigate of the German fleet was to be put into service in 2014 to replace the ageing warships of the cold war, but this will not happen at least next year because of faulty systems and avalanche growth, the local media report.
The commission of the Rhineland-Pfaltz, the main ship of the brand new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit with reference to a military representative.
The vessel was to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery complicated the fate of an ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be replaced by the ageing frigates of the Bremen class.
It is known that they will have a powerful rifle, multiple anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some steles technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer service periods, which should be possible to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
Nevertheless, the constant postponement of the entry into service means that the most modern warships that are said to allow Germany to spread its power abroad are becoming obsolete by the time they reach for arms, notes Die Zeit.
The evil F125 frigate fell in the headlines last year, when the German Navy formally refused to operate the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned the ship to the shipowner after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media referred to a number of critical “programme and hardware defects” that made the warship useless when used in combat.
The software deficiencies were particularly critical, as Baden-Württemberg ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors — only half the labour force on the old Bremen frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship was too heavy to reduce its productivity and limited the ability of the IMF to implement future updates.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rhineland-Pfaltz twice as heavy ships of the same class used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to defective equipment, the cost of the entire project, including team training, is also a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) compared with an initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of retention on the anchor of the newest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings about the reduction of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Committee, admitted that the naval forces “have actually completed the stock of ships capable of deploying”.
The clerk said that the problem had become worse over time because the old ships had been removed from operation, but they had not been provided with a replacement.
He visited that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class had ever been able to carry a fleet.
National Trust listens to the secret lives of bats
A new study conducted in one of Scotland’s mountains has the task of showing how bats use the landscape to find food.
It is to be hoped that the data obtained will allow a new look at the behavior of unique winged mammals and will help to continue to preserve the species.
A study organized by scientists of the Scottish National Fund will examine common bats, soprano bats, and brown long haired mice and Dobanton Nights, inhabited by Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special registrators will be installed at some locations around the site to monitor the operation of flying mice throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile field surveys using manual detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of screams and activities for which different groups of these animals are responsible.
A map of the habitat would then be drawn up and a report prepared to provide a detailed picture of their landscape behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Adviser, hopes that these results will show which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the main areas of work in the management of habitats, such as the formation of meadows, as well as the maintenance of forest masses, optimal for bats and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and all over Britain have declined significantly over the last century.
They are at risk of disappearance because of construction and nine-year-old works that affect their lives and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting installations may pose a danger, as well as a adhesive band for flies, chemical treatment of building materials and hunting of home cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, their nightly hunting habits are more beneficial than their eyes to catch prey.
They're using complex echo-location techniques to accurately identify obstacles to the flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very serious about the population of bats.
Ten trained experts are working in the organization, who regularly conduct interviews, visits and sometimes rescue work.
The organization even established the first and only reserve in Scotland for bats at the Threave in Damfris and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of Scottish bats live.
The real estate manager, David Thompson, says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave, a great place for bats," he said.
“There are old buildings here, many old trees and all the elements of a good habitat.
But much about bats remains unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to understand better what they need for a good existence.”
He recalls the importance of testing the presence of bats before maintenance within private property, since the unintentional destruction of one nest could lead to the death of up to 400 females and young people, and possibly even to the destruction of the entire local population.
Flying mice are protected by law, their destruction, herbing or destruction of their habitats is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the bat conservation fund, calls on the public to assist.
She says, "We still have much to learn about our bats, and we just don't know how many different species live."
Ronaldo denies rape charges, and his lawyers are about to sue a German magazine.
Kristian Ronaldo denies the charges against him of rape, calling them “fee news”, and claiming that people simply “will smoke” using his name.
His lawyers are about to file charges against a football player in a German news magazine called Spegel.
Forvard Portugal and Juventus were charged with rapeing an American woman named Catherine Majorga, who allegedly took place in a hotel number in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident, Spygel reported on Friday.
Speaking in Instagram, in which the football player 142 million subscribers a few hours after the charges were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo described this information as “fey news”.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is all the feicing news, says a five-time Ballon d'Or winner on camera.
“They just want to smoke using my name.
It's okay.
They want to become famous, say my name, but it's only part of their work.
I'm a happy man, and I'm great," adds an athlete with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are ready to file charges against Spegel, which they called “unacceptable information on confidentiality suspicions” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Shertz stated that the game intends to seek compensation for “moral damage in the amount of a legal violation that is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
It is alleged that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino hotel in Las Vegas.
Upon meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in an anal manner, according to documents filed at the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the alleged incident Ronaldo fell on her knees and told her that he was “99 per cent a good guy, but was single-percent.”
The papers allege Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was mutual consent.
Majorga also claims that she turned to the police and that the hospital had taken pictures of her injuries, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she felt “feared that she would be avenged” and feared “public humiliation”.
A 34-year-old woman said that she was trying to change her place of residence because she continued to experience traumatized feelings as a result of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was going to join Real Madrid in Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he moved to the Italian giants Yuve in a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: United Kingdom “Wishes to Autoproducers Lost Forever”
The Minister for Business and Enterprise, Greg Clark, stated that Britain would “suffer for good” if Brexit lost its world leader's car manufacturing status after Brexit.
He also commented on information that Toyota UK had informed BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Bernaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
A Japanese car manufacturer stated that the consequences of delays at the border in the absence of a deal within Brexit could result in job losses.
The Bernaston plant produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, and last year it released almost 150,000 cars, 90 per cent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped,” said Marvin Cook, Managing Director of Toyota in Bernastone.
Other car manufacturers in Britain expressed concern about leaving the EU without an international trade agreement, including on Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims to close a Mini Production plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that, in the absence of a deal within the Brexit supply chain, autoproducers say, supply chains would be at high risk.
The Toyota production line is launched “in due course”, and the parts for custom-made vehicles are delivered by British and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
Should Britain withdraw from the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be setbacks at the border, which, according to industry representatives, may result in delays and delays.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to keep supplies at its Derbyshire factory for more than one day, so the production will be stopped.
Mr. Clarke said that Teresa May's Chekers plan on future relations with the EU was “precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border”.
“We need a deal. We want to make a better agreement that will allow, I repeat, not only to succeed now, but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future,” he said in BBC Radio 4, “Today”.
“Not only Toyota, but also other producers argue that we must be absolutely able to continue successful supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to clarify the period for which production would be stopped, but in the longer term it warned that additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Zuvallaris, who worked in Bernaston for 24 years and is the head of the factory union, says, the concerns of the members of the organization are growing: “In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we can no longer return them.”
The representative of the Government said: “We have developed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU”.
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, according to information from the White House
Donald Trump's responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “transferred to another week” as the fight for the candidacy of Brett Kavano for the Supreme Judge continued, the White House declared on Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Special Adviser Robert Muller, who is investigating Russia's electoral intervention, the links between Trampa and Russia's assistants and potential obstacles to justice by the President.
Whether Trump would dismiss the Deputy Attorney-General, thereby endangering Muller's independence, there have been many speculations in Washington over many months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of wire to record conversations with Tram and the possibility of impeachment of the President through a 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denies that information.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House allegedly to resign.
Instead, on Thursday, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Tramp said he would “prefer not” to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a collision with the Senate judicial committee, where Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blacy Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's investigation into FBI complaints in Kavano, further delaying the Senate's full vote.
Secretary of State of Trump, Sarah Sanders, spoke to Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of the meeting was not yet scheduled, perhaps this week, and perhaps it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all the other events in the Supreme Court”.
But let us see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists contest this allegation: Sanders has not briefed the White House since 10 September.
Leading Chris Wallace wondered why.
Saunders said that the absence of briefings was not due to the “disappointment of the community” of television reporters, although she added, “I will not deny that they are playing in public”.
She suggested that the number of direct contacts between the Trump and the press should be increased.
“The president is holding more meetings in response to questions from journalists than any other president before him”, she added, without giving, however, exact figures: “We have those numbers”.
Sanders assured that the briefings would continue, but “if the press has the opportunity to direct questions to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me”.
We're trying to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we've had in the past few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the President of the United States, it's a worthy replacement for press briefs.”
The Trump regularly answers questions from the White House by attending open meetings or press conferences with high-level individuals.
For the press only, it is rare.
Freelance, and sometimes the President's strange behavior before the journalists gathered this week in New York may be the answer to why.
Minister of Health addresses EU workers in Scotland with a letter concerning concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health approached EU staff working in the Scottish GHS to express their gratitude on behalf of the whole country and to wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, MSP, had addressed this letter to staff less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the cost of applying for status applications to EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “The negotiations between Britain and the EU on exit continued during the summer, and an expected solution should be made to this autumn.
However, the British Government is also strengthening the preparation of a possible scenario with no transactions.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I want to emphasize once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery in connection with a head injury
Michael Organ of Tennessee reported that the half-protector, Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie, carried out an emergency operation with a head injury on Saturday after defeating 31-27 in a match with Vanderbilt Kommodores.
Tennessy Rod Reed, chief coach of state, told reporters that the injury had been sustained shortly before the break.
“He went up to the sidelines and just went down there,” said Reed.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before putting it on the stretchers and taking it to medical examination.
An official from Tennessee told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operating at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “until details of type/step injury are available”, and Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
For Abercrombie, who only took second class, it was the first season of Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, before leaving the game, he successfully intercepted five balls, which amounted to 18 balls per season.
Foreign buyers will pay higher herb charges for the purchase of real estate in Britain.
Under the new Tori plans, foreign buyers will be charged with higher herb charges for the purchase of real estate in the UK, and extra cash will be used to help the homeless.
This step will reverse Corbin's attempts to attract young voters.
Increased herb fee will be charged to those who don't pay taxes in the UK
Treasury expects it to raise up to £120 million a year in favour of the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher herb charges for the purchase of real estate in Britain, and extra cash will be used to help the homeless — announced today by Teresa May.
This step will reverse Corbin ' s attempts to attract young voters, which promises to make housing more accessible and raise citizens ' incomes.
The increase in the Herb fee would be charged by individuals and firms who did not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional funds thus obtained should stimulate the Government's efforts to assist homeless citizens.
The existing herb fee, including an increase of up to three per cent two years ago for secondary housing and rental accommodation, may amount to up to three per cent.
Treasury expects that this step will provide up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of London ' s new real estate is not purchased by British residents, which increases prices and complicates the task of buyers buying their first homes to improve their housing conditions thereafter.
Many elite areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country when they buy their homes.
The new policy was developed a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for the reduction of the herb fee to help the greater number of young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction firms of stifling property prices by acquiring land but not actually using them, and called on Ms. May to withdraw from available housing quotas in order to correct the “punishment situation with housing” in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms that would include rent control and the cessation of unjustified evictions.
He also wants to give local government more power to build new houses.
Ms. May stated: “I said last year that I had dedicated my Prime Minister to fulfilling the British dream of making life better with every new generation.
And that includes solving problems on our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build lives here.
However, it is unfair that for people who are not British citizens, as well as for foreign companies, the acquisition of real estate is as accessible as for hardworking British people.
For too many people, the dream of acquiring their own home has become too far away, and the threat to some is too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to control Scotland"
Boss of the Sunderland Club Jack Ross says that his “final goal” is to become Scottish Manager at a certain point.
A 42-year-old Scottishman enjoys the rebirth of the north-eastern club, which currently ranks third in the first league, separating from the top three points.
This summer he moved to Stadium of Light after returning St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a B cap, and everything," said Ross Sportssound BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching my father in Scotland in Hampton when I was a child, and it always attracted me back.
However, such an opportunity will occur only if I can become a successful manager of the club.”
Ross' predecessors, the managers of Sunderland were also Dick Lawyer, David Moies, Sam Allardays, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kin, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former manager of Alloa Athletic said that he did not suffer from such authoritative names in such large clubs, earlier abandoning the Barnsley and Ipswich Town proposals.
“For me, success for the moment will depend on whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
This club certainly belongs to the Premier League, according to its structure and possibilities,” says the coach.
“Bring him there is not an easy task, but I will take it that I have done my job only if I can get the club back.”
Ross worked for only three years as a manager, first as an assistant manager at Dumbarton, then spent 15 months at Hearts Training Headquarters.
He then helped Alloa rise from the third level and in the next season led St Mirren from the bottom positions in the champions.
Ross claims that today he feels more comfortable than ever in his game career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
“It was probably a real crossword,” he recalls his responsible work at Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that the management was more suitable than the game.
That sounds strange, because I've done everything right, well earned this job, and achieved some success.
But it's more complicated than that.
There are a lot of things that need to be done weekly.
I still have stress on my job, but I feel good about the manager.
I have always wanted to lead, and now I feel most comfortable as a fish in the water for the rest of my adult life.”

Summer heat has resulted in increased sales of British pubs, but has reduced sales in restaurants.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July and fell by 4.8 per cent in restaurants.
Peter Martin of the CGA Business Consulting Company, who received this statistic, says: “The continued solar activity, as well as longer than expected, meant that England’s participation in the world championship meant that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when sales in pubs grew by 2.8% and in restaurants, on the contrary, significantly decreased.”
The June decline in earnings in the restaurant trade by 1.8 per cent also continued in July.
The pubs and bars selling liquor showed much higher results comparable in restaurants.
The pubs that only sell food also suffered from the heat of the sun, although not as much as restaurants.
It's like people want to jump out of the street just to skip the glass.
The sale of beverages in pubs and bars increased by 6.6% per month and the food by 3%.”
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst for leisure and hotel business, says: “These results continue to be a trend that we have seen since late April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remain essential in the case of non-market sales.
It is not surprising that restaurant networks continue to experience difficulties, especially since the decline in sales by 4.8 per cent per annum will be particularly painful due to the continuing price pressure.
Long hot summer has proved more than ever to be for food operators, and it is not yet the fact that August, with a more moderate temperature, will give much-needed a break.”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened restaurants, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slow down in branding.
Industrial sales monitoring Coffer Peach Tracker in the British pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes 47 networks with a total turnover of more than £9 billion and is a recognized industry reference.
Every fifth kid has secret accounts in social networks that he hides from his parents.
According to the survey, each fifth child — some 11 years old — has secret accounts in social networks that he hides from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in Facebook pages
This news has raised concerns about the content of the sexual nature
Twenty percent of students said they had a “core” account that parents knew about.
However, every fifth child — some of them just 11 years old — creates social accounts that he hides from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of Insti feicing accounts, i.e. Instagram, a photo sharing site.
This news has raised concerns about publications of a sexual nature.
Twenty per cent of students said that they had a basic, “clean” account that their parents had access to, but also secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally had access to her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, came across a teenager who called on others to “rape him. ”
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) found that 40 per cent of children between 11 and 18 years of age had two social profiles, half of which had admitted that one was usually classified.
Head HMC Mike Buchanan says: “Many teenagers are trying to create online spaces that are not available to their parents and teachers, and this is a worrying fact”.
Eilid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" of Scottish Light Athletics
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eilid Doyle was elected to the board of directors of Scottish Light Athletics as an observer member of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most titled athlete in light athletics, and President Ian Bitty claims that this step is a great opportunity for sports leaders to take advantage of the vast experience of athletes at the international level over the past decade.
“Eilid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and World Air Force, and we are confident that its participation will bring great benefit to the athletics in Scotland,” said Beatty.
Doyle says, “I strive to become the voice of athletes, and I hope that I can make a really good contribution and contribute to the development of sports in Scotland”.
An American who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games has four gold Olympic medals in total, and now works as a regular commentator at the BBC, after a transfer, lost his ability to walk.
He writes in his Twitter account: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I've lost the ability to move.
The doctors said that only time would tell me whether I was going to make amends, and if so, to what extent.
It was a debilitating job, but I'm completely cured, I've learned to walk again, and today I'm doing the soft exercise!
Thank you very much for your support!"
Advertising of breast milk, in which nursing mothers were compared to cows, shared the opinions of Internet users
The dairy company has raised disputes on the Internet by publishing an advertisement where nursing mothers are compared with suckling cows.
By placing on the market, it is said, “the world’s first silent milky system that can be worn on the breasts”, Elvie published a commercial music video showing the freedom that the new milky system provides to nursing mothers.
Four real moms dance in a full haystack under the music track, which says, "Yes, I'm feeding my own milk, but you won't see my tail," and "If you haven't noticed, it's not a wash, it's my breast."
And then chorus: "We drive, we race, we feed our babies with breast milk, we race, we drive."
This advertisement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: the video received a mixed response from the viewers, many of whom say it sheds light on the shocks of the dairy industry.
“A very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to become pregnant and give birth to milk, except that their children are taken away from them within a few days of birth," one user writes.
Lactose Elvie is dressed directly under a special bragalter (Elvie/Mother)
Here is another comment: “It is clear that it is equally traumatic for both mothers and children.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breast milk for mothers who leave behind their children? "
Another user adds, “Adverted from reality”.
Others, on the contrary, defended the role, and one woman even wrote that the song was “just great”.
"I think that's a great idea.
If I was feeding a baby, I'd have to buy one.
Breast - feeding really made me feel like a cow.
Advertising, of course, is a little crazy, but it's kind of like that.
“A genius product,” wrote one user.
And another comment: “A beautiful advertisement designed for mothers who feed their breasts (often they do it directly at their workplaces or in the toilets) and who, indeed, feel a little ‘coves’.
This advertisement is not to praise or brand our dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women showed that they were all dancing with these inseparable breasts hidden under their bras.
The concept of this advertising campaign is precisely based on the fact that many women who breast feed say they feel cows.
In fact, Elvie’s milky system is completely incomprehensible, has no ducts or tubes, is freely placed in a feeding bra, while it is undetected, giving women the opportunity to move, to hold little children and even to go out during feeding.
Ana Balarin, a partner and early development specialist for Mother’s children, commented: “Molokootsos Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserves a bold and provocative advertisement.
In keeping with the parallel between women and suckling cows, we wanted to focus our attention on breastfeeding and all its problems, while demonstrating in a joking and cheerful way the incredible sense of freedom that gives new dairy.
It's not the first time that Elvie's milk system gets into the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the stage of the designer Martha Jakubowski using this product as an appointment.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent on the border with Texas unhindered
The number of migrant children detained has increased dramatically, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be accommodated by their guardians.
Usually, most sponsors are the same immigrants without documents and are afraid to endanger their stay in the country under the supervision of the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential custodians and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a high-ranking immigration and customs officer, testified at Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested to take custody of minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees had not been tried before.
“About 80 per cent of those who are either guardians or members of their families are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are foreigners who have committed the crime.
We therefore continue to persecute these persons," said Olbens.
According to the shelter, in an effort to speed up the process of child formation, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to be brought before the court within a month of detention, not 60 days, as before.
In order to assert their legal status as immigration judge, many of them are present on video rather than in person.
Those who are considered not entitled to assistance will be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and information from the system in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression, which may lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say that these problems are increasing in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child is having difficulties are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that transporting children to tent camps without giving them time emotionally to prepare or say good - bye to friends can add to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders the “occupation forces” of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country had been in war for the eighth year.
Mualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism, and “will be considered accordingly”.
“They must leave immediately and without conditions”, he said to the assembly.
Mualem insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, millions of people have been expelled from their homes, “the war on terrorism is almost over”.
He said that Damascus would continue “to fight this sacred battle until we had cleared all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, who mainly train and advise both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs who speak against President Bashar Assad.
The French contingent has over 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said that good conditions had been created for their return, and accused “some Western countries” of the “spreading of irrational fears” that had prompted refugees to remain outside the country.
“We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of citizens”, he said.
“They politicize what must be a purely humanitarian issue”.
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped to recover until a political agreement to end the war between Assad and the opposition is reached.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large fence of the Idlib rebels created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province where three million people lived.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had “a clear deadline” and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against Jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaida-related front of Nusr, who would be “destroyed”.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the Government and opposition, will soon be convened to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian Government to participate in the committee, stating that the work of the commission should be limited to “considering the articles of the current constitution” and cautioned against interference.
Why Trump Wins Second Term
In line with this logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-election in 2020 if the impeachment and scandal do not bring his presidency to an early conclusion, which is likely to be hoped for by many liberal viewers.
And this will undoubtedly be “the most dramatic final of the presidency in history!”
At present, there are no signs of the fatigue of the viewers.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have grown more than twice — up to 1.05 million CNNs and almost three times — to 1.6 million MSNBCs.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million prime-time viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC show "The Rachel Maddow Show" exceeded cable channel ratings by collecting 3.5 million viewers per night during the main news show.
“This is the fire to which the people are drawn, because it is outside our understanding”, says Neil Barr, director of the ABC drama “The Appointed Survival”, of a cabinet member who becomes president after the Capitol was destroyed as a result of the attack.
Nell Sköll, a long-standing comedy writer and author of "Just funny: A few unpleasant truths about getting into the Hollywood Boys Club" offers another theory.
She recalls that she once went to a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told her she was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He replied, “Yes, because he is funny,” she said.
In all this chaos, there is something precious — fun.
Of course, unlike the rest of the content broadcast on television, Washington news lines can determine the future of Row v. Wade and answer questions about the possibility of family reunification of immigrants and the health of the world economy.
Disfellowshipping is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, when you see for the sixth hour in a row how the group of experts discusses the use of Bob Woodward's Deep Background for his book Strah, or Paul Manafort's jacket for $15,000 from ostrich skin (the garment, the warmed-up pride, says Washington Post), or about the sharp description of Storm Daniels, let's say, the anatomy of Mr. Tramp is already beyond normal awareness.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario again with the same eyes.
“It’s often his job to make us feel that the reality show is that he feeds you something every night,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the creator of "Pawn Stars" about the changing actor composition of the Trump show and the daily turn of the plot (drake with N.F.L., praise Kim Chen Yin).
You can't afford to miss a single episode, or you're hopelessly behind.
When I contacted Mr. Flays this week, there were 27 degrees of heat on the northern coast of Cauai, the sun lit, but he hid inside his house and watched MSNBC during the CNN recording.
He could not get away from the screen, at least not exactly when he showed how Brett Kavano was presented to the Senate Legal Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was being decided.
“I remember when we did all these crazy shows, people said, “This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” says Mr. Flays.
"Then I still thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Outsaider's money is poured into the fiercest intermediate elections that White House leads.
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives a cash flow through the change of districts in Congress, where two officials participate in the race for the same place.
This suburban district of Pittsburgh, whose geography has not been changed for so long, is supported by a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lamb, who received a seat in another district in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb is opposed to another active official, the Republic of China Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is significantly intersecting with the new 17th.
The cards were reviewed after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January ruled that, as a result of election machinations, the old districts had been assigned to the republics in violation of the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a heated debate on the financing of campaigns between the financial forces of the main party — the Committee of the Congress of Democratic Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NRCC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after winning a small difference in the March special elections in Congress in the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This place has been occupied by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the county with 20 points of advantage.
Political experts give Democrats a small advantage.
The United States ordered El Salvador to support China, but then retreated.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, causing a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama, and he also owned it in Panama until the partners moved out the management team of the Trump organization.
Representatives of the State Department decided to withdraw United States heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the grounds of “the recent decisions on Taiwan's non-recognition”, said a press secretary at the beginning of this month at the Heser Nauert Department.
However, only El Salvador received about $140 million in assistance in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed sanctions, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country, with its high unemployment and killings.
Against the backdrop of regular internal meetings, the representatives of North and Central America postponed the high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which should have been held to follow up on a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in preventing migration to the United States.
By mid-September, however, the senior officials of the Administration had made it clear that they wanted the preparation of the conference to continue, and had actually discontinued the consideration of El Salvador ' s punishment.
According to diplomats, the conference is scheduled to take place in mid-October and will be addressed by Vice-President Mike Penz in a sense that the administration attaches real importance to this meeting.
Three American diplomatic representatives returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without bringing any new strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debates described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal issues subject to anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an outside analyst who was involved in the administration but also spoke anonymously.
Study History
The next step could be to report to Special Adviser Robert Muller on the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump ' s justice, which is now very substantial evidence in public reports.
Mr. Muller was also reportedly investigating the existence of a collusion of the Trump campaign with Russia and its attacks during the last elections.
If Congress replaces the host, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in this body, just as he is preparing to speak to the electorate again, and perhaps eventually before the jury of its colleagues.
But there's a lot of "if"; I don't mean to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, as well as the fall of his equivalent in Europe.
We will all make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to establish a coup d'état and overthrow Hitler, and this would have happened if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
However, we have not done so and have missed the opportunity to avoid the bloodshed of the years to come.
The course of history unfolds at such points, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are experiencing some of these critical moments right now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the newspaper, last year, he proposed to make secret records of the activities of the President and considered his office unfit.
Mr. Rosenstein argues that the Times data is incorrect.
“How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Cavanaugh is not complete or true, or if he is still approved for the post of Chief Justice despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
First of all, will we vote for Congress in the medium term, which will bring Mr. Trump to justice?
If we do not pass these tests with dignity, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we can pass them with dignity thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jewish exiled to Auschwitz under the same Nazi regime, whose officials once occupied an ambassador's house, where I lived many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she guided me to light a Saturday candle on a table with a swastika symbol.
With such a family past as I may not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic in the run-up to the Rapid Vienna football club.
Rangers accept the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after an impressive nobody in Spain over the Villarreal at the beginning of this month, will enable them to take strong positions in Group G of the League of Europe.
The knee trauma prevented half-protector Graham Dorrans from performing for the first time in the season to no one with account 2:2 against Villarreal, but he believed that Rangers could use the result as a tramp to achieve great results.
“This was a good time for us because Villarreal is a good team,” said a 31-year-old football player.
"We got into a game thinking we could get something, but we left with nobody.
Perhaps, after all, we were able to do it, but in general, no one was likely the right result.
They probably played better in the first time, and our success came to the second time where we were better.
This Thursday will be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but this will be a difficult game because they showed a good result in their last game, but given the support of the fans, I'm sure we'll be able to move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard, given all my injuries and my replacements at the club, but now there's a good factor in this place.
The composition is wonderfully similar, and the boys really enjoy it; the training has gone to “ura”.
I hope we can move forward, leave behind last season and succeed.”
Women are losing sleep because of fear of their retirement savings
Although the interviewers had a clear idea of how they wanted them to be cared for, few spoke to family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the national study said that they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
However, only 10 per cent said they spoke to their children on the subject.
“People want to be taken care of by a family member but do not try to discuss the subject with them,” says Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide in life insurance.
And that's exactly what we need to start with.
Talk to your spouse and your children: you cannot prepare your family for what they may have to take care of you if you do not make your wishes sound in advance.
Discuss with your consultant and family where and how you will receive medical care, as this choice may be an important factor in the cost plan.
Get along with your financial consultant: it will help you develop a plan to pay these costs.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may be covered by a traditional long-term insurance policy or mixed life insurance policy that will help meet these costs or self-insured by your own property, provided you have money.
Order your legal documents: get rid of the legal battles.
Make sure that you have a medical check-in and identify a trustee who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in the event that you cannot communicate.
It is also recommended that the possibility of financial trust be considered.
A trusted person should be selected to help you make financial decisions and to monitor your accounts if you prove ineffective.
Remember that your elderly parent needed urgent medical attention, and he is on his way to the hospital.
Would you then be able to provide information on what medication he is taking and what his allergies are for?
Write down all these details on the paper so that you can prepare for each case.
Martin adds: “It is important not only the availability of finance but also the choice of doctors”.
“What medicines do you take?
Who's gonna take care of your dog?
Write down and write down this plan.”

A man fired from a pneumatic rifle several times, returning home from a party.
The victim, whose chest, abdomen, and arm had been shot for 40 years, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon.
The police described the shooting that took place at around 02:30 in English summer time as “accident”.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening and the police are currently looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
Officials say that at least 384 people were killed as a result of the massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian town of Palu on Friday and are expected to increase.
As a result of communications, rescue workers cannot obtain any information from Donggal, the area north of Palu, which is closer to the 7.5-ball earthquake epicentre.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu as a result of a natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggal, located on the island of Sulavez:
Palu is the capital of central Sulavezi Province, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of Sulavesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 (data for 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a district stretching along 300 km (180 miles) of the coastline in the north-west of Sulava.
The district, an administrative district smaller than the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the cornerstone of the Central Sulavez province's economy, particularly in the Donghala coastal region.
The custom of nickel is also important for the province's economy, but is mainly concentrated in Morovov, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, over the past 100 years, the tsunami has experienced several destructions in Palu and Donggal.
In 1938 the tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Tsunami also took place in the western part of Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on a Pacific volcano ring and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: The heavy earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province of Indonesia in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami of 14 countries that killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: The follow-up to the heavy earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Earthquake by 6.8 hit southern Java, Indonesia ' s densest island, causing tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: Magnitude earthquake took place in Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people have died.
2010: Earthquake of 7.5 points occurred on one of the islands of Mentaway in Sumatra, causing tsunamis of up to 10 metres, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hit Pidi Jay County in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because people remembered the devastating earthquake of 2004 and the tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the destruction of buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit Indonesia ' s Lombok tourist island, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists temporarily remained in ruins.
Sarah Payne's eldest son is arrested on domestic violence charges.
Trak Payne, the eldest son of former Governor Alaska and vice candidate of President Sarah Paylin, was arrested on charges of assault.
A 29-year-old Paylin, from Vasilyla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence situation and resisting arrest, according to a report issued on Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took her phone.
According to KTUU, Paylin is in the Mat-Su Detention Facility and will be released on bail of $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked whether he was guilty, he declared his “single innocence”.
The drug is threatened by the three minor crimes of Class A, which means that he may be deprived of his liberty for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B crime punishable by one day ' s imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Paylin.
In December 2017 he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Payne, called the police to report an alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of the report on domestic violence and for the possession of weapons in an alcoholic state in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her on the face.
Sarah Paylin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she explained the violent behaviour of her son by post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly resulting from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died as a result of the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulavez on Friday.
The 7.5 - blob earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication are not working, and the number of victims will increase in the next few days.
The earthquake occurred near central Sulavesa, north-east of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
There are video recordings of an accident on social networks.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal Prosecutor's Office wants to impose a rare death sentence on a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York.
The Federal Prosecutor ' s Office in New York seeks the death penalty for Saiful Saipov, suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York, which killed eight people, a rare punishment for a federal crime that has not been used in the state since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly hired a truck home Depot to launch an attack on a bicycle on the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, beating down pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight people and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to achieve the death penalty imposed in the South District of New York.
According to the judicial document, the death penalty may be imposed on both charges.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury read out to Saipou a conviction with 22 counts, which included eight counts of murder for a racket commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and automobile destruction.
According to prosecutors, the attack was “pretentiously planned and deliberate”, Saipov carried it out, as described in “a disgusting, cruel and criminal manner”.
“Sifullo Habibullaevich Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Lora Decadetta, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlia, Hernan Ferrogui, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiana Pagnukko”, says the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the prosecutor demanded the death penalty in the southern district of New York for a criminal offence.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, the accused, was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.
For the last time, the federal death penalty in New York was applied in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed using an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the judicial documents of the Saipov, the child of Uzbekistan had shown no repentance after his attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was glad he did it.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired to see IGIL's video on the phone to carry out the attack.
He also asked the IGIL flag to be hanged in her hospital room, reported to the police.
He denies his guilt for all 22 counts of indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders on the side of Saipo, said that they were “evidently disappointed” with the decision of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
“We believe that the death penalty decision, not the life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only exacerbate the pain of these events for all of their participants,” Patton said.
The defence of Saipov had previously appealed to prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Member of Parliament from Tori said that NAIJEL FARAJ should not be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Today, during the protest at the Tori Najgel Farage conference, he vowed “to mobilize the people’s army”.
Former Ukip leader said that politicians should “sense” Eurosceptics, since a member of the Theresa May Parliament suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Peter Boone, a member of the Conservatives' party, said at a rally in Birmingham that Britain would already be “above” if Mr Farage had been the Secretary of Brexit.
However, the problem faced by Ms. May in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks is compounded by the fact that the members of the Tori party who are opposed to leaving the EU join a separate protest against Brexit, which is taking place in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to preserve his compromise plan, which has been sounded at Chekers in the midst of the attacks by the supporters of Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The Allies insist that she continue to try to make a deal with Brucessel despite the negative reaction, and thus force the Eurosceptics and Labourers to choose between her package and the chaos.
Mr. Boone said at the Leave Means Leave (To Survive) meeting at Solichal that he wanted to play "Cockers".
He suggested that Mr. Faraz should be leveled and held responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been responsible, we would have gone out,” he said.
Deputy Wellingboro added: “I will continue to speak for Brexit, but we need to play the Checkers.”
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We have not fought in the wars of the world to be dependent.
We want our laws in our country.”
Mr. Boone rejected the assumption that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British had changed their minds and wanted to stay was completely untrue”.
A participant in Brexit from the Tori Party, Andrea Jenkins, was also at a rally, giving journalists the following comment: “I say, Prime Minister, just listen to the people”.
“Checkers is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, and he is also unpopular among the members of our party and our activists who are actually storming the streets and most of all elect us.
Please put the caser aside and listen to what they say."
In her strong appeal to Ms. May, she added: “Premier ministers remain at work if they remain faithful to their promises”.
Mr. Farage said that if the politicians were going to give away the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, they should be forced to “feel”.”
“It is now a question of trust between us, people and our political class,” he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "We're not going to let it go."
Turning to the excited crowd, he added: “I want our political class on the verge of Brexit’s betrayal to feel at ease.
“We are mobilizing the people's army of this country, which has made us victorious in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become independent, independent and proud of the United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, the opponents of Brexit attended a demonstration on Birmingham, then held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Several activists waved "Tori v. Brexit" posters this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, criticized conservatives because of security problems in their mobile annex.
“And these people argue that they can set up Canada plus IT systems and technologies to work on borders for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
"It's one perfect farce.
There is no good Brexit in principle," he argues.
Warren plans to “examine” the opportunities for participation in the presidential race
U.S. Parliament member Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections, she will “studently explore the possibilities of balling in the Presidents”.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts on Saturday told about her future at a rally in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Jeff Dil, a member of the Republic Party, co-chaired by the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
Talking about having a chance to take up the post of Trump in 2020.
On Saturday, in Holiok, she held another meeting with the voters; since Trump took office, it has been her 36th meeting with voters in the format of a meeting of the town hall.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it was time for the women to go to Washington to "rest" our broken government, and that it would take a woman to be upstairs."
As a result of the assassination of Simsa (cloaked), LSU was arrested
Baton Rouge Police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the murder (shooting) of a basketball player, LSU Wade Sims, who took place on Friday, was arrested.
At 11:00 in English time, Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years of age, at a press conference.
On Friday, the police department released a video of the shooting request to help identify the person who was able to download the video.
20-year-old Simms was shot near a South University campus Friday morning.
“Wade Simms received a gunshot wound to the head that resulted in his death,” said Chief of Police, Murphy J. Paul, to journalists on Saturday.
Wade joined his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to participating in the incident, carrying weapons and shooting at Wade Sims.
At the time of his arrest, Simpson did not resist and was detained at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
A young man who grew to be 1 m 82 cm raised in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starters last season and gained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 selections for the game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the title of the World Cup after a team tactic gave him victory over Sebastian Fettel
From the time that Walter Buttas was trained on a Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team tactics would play a major role in the race.
Already, with the poul-position of Bottas, he was a good starter and a practical hanger on Hamilton when he defended his position on the first two turns, and invited Fettel to attack his comrade on the team.
Fettel went first to the pit stop, leaving Hamilton dancing in the tail of the whole group – the choice that became decisive.
Mercedes went down a pit-stop one circle, and then went behind Fettel, but Hamilton, after some wheel-wheel struggle, rushed forward, leading the Ferrary driver reluctantly left the inner space free, at risk of crashing after a double motion to protect on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from behind a number of nets and was seventh to the end of the first round.
He then ran most of the race, holding on to his home tires, in order to finish quickly, bringing Kimi Rykkonen to fourth place.
As a result, he went to a pit stop in the 44th circle, but was unable to increase the pace of the remaining eight circles, as Rikkonen took fourth place.
It was a difficult day because Walter had done fantastic work on weekends and had shown true generosity by sharing it with me.
The team has done such an exceptional job to have a few tricks in stock," said Hamilton.
Transmitted Sign Language
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Diane Feynstein at a meeting with the voters on Saturday for her assertion that she had not published a letter from Christine Blacy Ford, who accused Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Judge, of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not mention directly the statement given by Ford to the Senate Legal Committee, he said that the Senate had shown that the participants were “bad, disgusting and lying people”.
“The only possible response to all of this, and what has been happening in the last few days in the Senate is wonderful, it is anger, anger, abomination and lies,” he said.
“You see all these diversions, and then they say, ‘No, I did not.
I didn't do it.”
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you guys do information?
Remember her answer... did you "say" the information of the document?
Oh, no.
I wasn't.
Yeah, stop.
"Did we, "have we?"...No, we didn't "pray," he added with the senator's intuition.
A letter detailing the charges made by Ford v. Kavanaugh was sent in July and it was unlawfully made public in early September, but Feynstein denies that the leak took place in her office.
“I did not conceal Dr. Ford’s allegations, but I did not disclose her information,” said Feynstein to the Committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep this information secret, and I did as she asked.”
However, the manner in which she denied the charges of flight did not seem to like the president who commented on it during the Saturday meeting: “That’s what I’m going to say: the language of the body has failed her well.
Maybe she wasn't barking, but the language of the body was the worst thing I've ever seen."
The President, while continuing to protect his candidate for the post of Chief Justice, whose three women were accused of sexual harassment, suggested that the Democrats were using these charges for their own purposes.
“They certainly try to regain their power by all means available.
We are watching the depravity, disgustingness, they don't care who they're insulting, through whom they have to overreach to gain power and control," the Mediate quoted the President as saying.
British Elite Hockey League: Dandy Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Duier scored two goals for the "Jiants" in a game against Dandi
In the game of Elite Hockey League, Dandy Stars paid for Friday's defeat against Belfast Giants, winning the match Saturday with a score of 5-3 in favour of Dandy.
Jiants received an early advantage in two goals thanks to the blows by Patrick Duier and Francis Boviler.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney raised the level of the home team before Duyer led the Jayants to the leaders.
François Bushard compared the Dandy score before two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory.
For the people of Adam Cephas who won the Dandi score of 2:1 in Belfast on Friday evening, it was the third defeat in the Elite League season.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the parties, when the Giants won three previous matches.
The first goal of the dueler came in at 3:35 p.m. after Kendall McFoll's bare belt with David Rutherford's support, after which Bovilleer doubled the advantage four minutes later.
During the start-up period, Sullivan returned the owners to the game at 13:10 before Matt Markwardt designed Coney's balance sheet at 15:16.
Dwyer was assured that the Jayants had taken the initiative at the first break when he scored the second goal at night at the end of the first period.
The masters were regrouped, and Bushar leveled the bill again, scored a goal at 27:37 p.m.
Coney and Charles Corcoran united to help Nielsen give Dandi the chance for the first time to take the lead at the end of the second period, after which he and his team won, holding their rivals in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
Jiants, currently losing four of the last five matches, are headed to Milton Keynes for the next match, which will be held on Friday.
Air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on board could avoid an earthquake
The Indonesian air traffic controller was posthumously assigned to the character after he deliberately died so that a plane with hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
More than 800 people died and many were missing as a result of the severe earthquake on the island of Sulavese on Friday that caused the tsunami.
Strong underground poles continue to destroy the area, and many of the inhabitants of Palu have been under the rubble of buildings.
Despite the fact that his colleagues escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the extremely high station at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport, Palu.
He remained in his seat to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
Then, when he felt that the tower was coming down, he jumped with it.
Later, he died in a hospital.
The representative of Indonesia's air navigation, Johannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reports the Australian Agency ABC News.
We set up a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to get him to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the dispatcher died before the helicopter could land in Palu.
“We are very sorry for this loss,” he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths caused by the earthquake can reach thousands because, according to the disaster management agency, access to the cities of Donggal, Sighi and Butong is limited.
“The number of victims is likely to increase, as a large number of people are still under debris and many are still unable to get out of there,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative.
The waves, six metres high, devastated the city of Palu, where the destruction of the dead will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide humanitarian assistance to the affected city.
Rissa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, says Sky News: “Early aid brings victims every minute.
Clean water isn't enough.
Mini-marts are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, says CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross workers are already rushing to help the survivors, but we do not know that they will stop there.
Tragedy has already taken on a rather serious scale, but everything can be much worse.”
President Joko Vidodo, of Indonesia, arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's armed forces, saying, among other things: “I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
“ Are you ready? ” CNN says.
Earlier this year, Indonesia suffered from an earthquake in Lombok, which killed over 550 people.
Microphone crash: Air Niugini now reports that one person is missing after a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline that was flying, the victim of a crash in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports that one person was missing, while it was said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had safely left the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini reports that as of Saturday, it has no information on one male passenger.
The airline stated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find this person.
The airline was unable to respond immediately to requests for further information on the passenger, such as his or her age or nationality.
Local sailors helped save other passengers and the aircraft team after it fell on water, trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline also reported that on Saturday, six passengers were hospitalized and all are in stable condition.
The reasons for the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The United States Air Force and the US Navy claim that the aircraft landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane was unable to land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes says the plane started to set in on the runway too low.
“And that’s very good, ” adds Janes.
Janes told us that he and other passengers had been able to make an emergency exit to the sinking plane because the water level was a belt.
He also said that the stewardesses panicked and shouted on board and that he had a slight head injury.
U.S. Navy reports that the seamen repairing the docks nearby also helped rescue by using an inflatable boat on which they delivered people on the shore before the plane sank about 30 metres (100 feet).
Data from the Air Safety Network show that 111 people have been killed in air accidents with aircraft registered in PNG, but none of these accidents have been related to Air Niugini.
The intelligence analyst was able to prove the burning of a woman alive.
On Saturday, the prosecution filed a case against a man accused of burning a Mississippi resident in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Roulett gave many hours of testimony as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He told the department how he used mobile phone records to make a general picture of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim of Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Roulette explained that he had received data on the whereabouts of these people from several mobile phones; according to this data, Tellis spent time with Chambers that evening, contrary to his previous testimony, reports The Clarion Ledger.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the data he received, his mobile phone was near Chambers; when the circumstances became clear, the police questioned Sanford.
In his testimony, Sanford said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Sanford if Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Stanford said that "it was a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before she died.
However, according to phone records, they were only called within one week.
Roulett also showed that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he removed her text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” says Hale.
The defence must begin to present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is Hip-hop?
Three hip hoppers are going to fight the negative attitude towards this genre by filling their music with positive content.
The High Breed Group from Bristol claims that the hip hop content has changed from original political and social problems.
The group wants to go back to their roots and make hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common recently witnessed rebirth in Britain thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one!
New York nanny sued a family couple because of racist texts.
A New York nanny sued a family couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a report from a woman complaining that a nanny was “another black” who mistakenly sent a nurse instead of her husband.
Spouses deny that they are racist, claiming that the action is filed with “the purpose of extortion”.
Lynci Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, was concerned that the new nanny offered by Childcare Services, Giselle Morris, was black when she came to the family on her first day in 2016.
“She’s not here, it’s not that, but one black one, ” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flexman in a text to her husband.
However, instead of texting her husband, she misplaced him twice, Miss Morris.
Conscious of her indiscretion, Plasco-Flexman fired Morris, stating in the service that a nanny who was African-American was doing her job badly, and that they were expecting a Filipino, not an African-American woman, reported New York Post.
Morris was paid for one day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Morris is now suing a family couple and requires compensation in the amount of $350 a day for six months, under the terms of the original oral agreement, which, however, was not secured by any contract.
“I want them to understand: such things are unacceptable,” she said on Friday, adding, “And I know that this is discrimination.”
Spouses disagree with the charge of racism and claim that the dismissal of Morris could be considered a reasonable step, since they would no longer be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her a message saying that she didn’t really mean it.
She's not racist.
We are not racist," said the husband, Joe Plasco, the Post.
"But would you trust your children to someone with whom you were rude, even if you were loaded, not wanting it yourself?
Would you trust your newborn child?
Come on!'
Calling the claim a “extortion”, Plasco said that his wife had only given birth to a child two months ago and found herself in “a very difficult situation”.
“And you are ready to pursue a man in that position?
Not very nice of you,” added a banking worker specializing in investment.
The trial is still ongoing, but public opinion has already handed down its sentence on social networks, accusing the couple of unacceptable behaviour and problems with logic.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not understand the move with the speaker bear, says a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted as a publisher, commented: “It is difficult to put yourself in the place of the first reader before it was published.
It's very funny to know that Paddington is very successful.”
She also said that her father, before he had decided to write a children's book on bear bear, had worked as an operator for the BBC and had turned down the publication with optimism, and added that the 60-year anniversary of his books was “and happy and bitter” because last year their author had not become.
With regard to Paddington, she refers to him as “a very important member of our family”, and that her father was quietly proud that his character eventually became known.
“He was a quiet and modest person, ” says his daughter.
“It was only for him that Paddington was so real, and it was almost as if his own child had been successful; he was proud of them, although he did not really consider this success to be his own merit.
I think that's how he treated Paddington's success.
Subdington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he always paid tribute to the bearer himself.”
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After the plane landed, her daughter was taken to Nitsa Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors vainly tried to save her life.
“On the phone regularly and said that everything was really bad, something went wrong,” said Mrs. Eden-Laperuz.
"Then he called again and said that she would die in the next two minutes, and that we should say goodbye.
I did.
I said, "Daddy, I love you so much, honey.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that the doctors gave her, forcing her heart to work, gradually ceased to function as she left her body.
She died before expected.
I should have just sat there and waited, knowing that everything was coming to an end.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold on tightly to myself.”
Eventually, Mrs. Edenn Laperus, in his grief about losing her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers, accepting the enormous loss she had just had to endure.
“No one around knew what had happened,” she says.
"My head is up, I'm still crying.
It's hard to explain, but it's just during the flight that I've experienced this inextricable feeling of sympathy for Nadu.
He so needed my love and support.
I know how much he loved her."
Women who have lost loved ones prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are trying to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey post cards on the Welsh Bridge with comforting words and phone numbers that people can apply for support from.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 years old when he was depressed, and at the age of 18, he died.
“I don’t want other parents to experience the same things that I experience every day,” she says.
45-year-old Davis, living in Lidney, tells us that her son was a great cook and had a fucking charming smile.
“Everyone loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiled, the room seemed to be lit by light.”
But before he died, he left his job because he had been in a truly terrible time.”
This happened in 2014, and Tyler, who died with him, found his brother, who was 11 years old.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm not anymore afraid of a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis invented these cards, "so people know there's someone to talk to, even if it's your friend.
We must not sit and be silent, and we must speak to people.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her husband, who was 15 years old, did not come soon after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, upset or anything like that,” she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed changes in his mood.
He was especially ill at Christmas; he did not even look at the children when they opened their presents."
She says that his death was a huge injury to them, but they have to go through it, this event has shaken our family.
It ripped her apart.
But we must continue to live and fight."

Britta Cavanaugh's future hanging on the hair: FBI launches investigation
“I thought that if we could get something like what he asked for — an investigation limited in time and volume, we could bring some unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was “breaking up” against the backdrop of a growing party chain reaction.
Why did Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the reason for their hesitation.
The interim elections will take only five weeks, 6 November, and if, as is expected, everything goes badly wrong for the Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their efforts to obtain the person they want and elected him as the country’s supreme judge.
George W. Bush calls the senators, lobbying for Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked in the White House for Mr. Bush since then, and who thanks Bush to his future wife Ashley, who was then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
A vote will be taken in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavano will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate meeting, which would allow Vice-President Mike Penz to resolve the issue of equality of votes and to confirm his candidacy for the post of Chief Justice.
The number of North Korean refugees decreased with Kim
Since Kim Chen Yin came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has decreased, the South Korean legislator said.
Pak Byong Seugg, referring to data from the Ministry of the South, stated that, compared to 2,706 cases of escape recorded in 2011, last year this figure fell to 1,127 cases.
Mr. Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China had become key factors, as well as higher rates charged by smugglers exporting people.
The pheny of public comments does not make any difference.
The overwhelming majority of North Korean refugees are eventually offered the nationality of South Korea.
Seoul claims that, since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most people flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a secure demilitarized zone (DPZ) between the two Koreas.
China viewed refugees as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often subjected them to forced repatriation.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is still in war, has improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to resume the deadlocked nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This took place following the June historic meeting of President Donald Trump and Kim Jong in Singapore, at which they reached general agreements on the disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yoon-Ho accused the United States of preventing progress in this matter by sanctions.
“If we do not have the slightest confidence in the United States, we will also have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will in no way be able to begin disarmament unilaterally,” said Mr. Ri in his statement to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Cavanaugh “hysterical” and claims that he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the Nancy Pelosi House named Brett Kavano, a candidate for the post of supreme judge, “extremely” and said that because of his temperateness, he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosy made this comment in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman would ever be allowed to behave in a similar way, she would be immediately referred to as “the spark”, says Pelosi, who responded to Kavano’s testimony in the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavano emotionally denied Dr. Christine Blacy Ford's allegations of sexual harassment, which allegedly occurred when they were both teenagers.
Cavanaugh spoke emotionally enough, sometimes even screaming and choking, talking about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the democrats of the committee, calling it “the grotesque and clearly planned killing of the person acting”, organized by liberals who were upset that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi also said that, in her opinion, Kavano merely confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was biased against the Democrats.
“I think that he disqualifies himself with his allegations, as well as with the way he moves on the Clintons and Democrats”, she said.
Pelos was outraged when she was asked whether she would try to bring Kavano to justice if his guilt confirmed and if the Democrats received a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I say this: if he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not suitable for the Supreme Court only, but also for the court in which he is sitting now,” Pelosi said.
Kavano is currently the judge of the District Court of Appeal, D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible decisions by Kavano with regard to the Accessible Medical Services Act or Row v. Wade since he was considered representative of conservative justice.
In his candidacy, Cavanaugh left the question of whether he would cancel certain Supreme Court decisions.
“Now is not the time to let a person who is virulent and biased into the office of a superior judge, and to say, ‘How wonderful!’ ” said Pelosi.
And women have to own it.
It is righteous anger, months, and years of rage; it cannot go through this without tears.
"When we get angry, we cry," Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s as unusual as you think it is?”
She continued: “I was very helped by a woman who worked somewhere in a senior position, and she said that she also cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique to explain to her interviewer, ‘You might think I was crying because I’m upset.
I'm really pissed."
And then she just kept talking.
I was impressed by this approach.”
The tears are allowed to come out of anger partly because they are mistreated in the root.
One of my most painful memories of the first job in the office where men dominated me was once crying out of anger, but I was grabbed by an elderly woman's neck, a soulless manager, who I've always been terribly afraid of, and dragged to a stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
They do not know that you weep for evil.
They think you are upset, and they rejoice, thinking that they have finally brought you to life."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from the Democrats in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential elections.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught on some serious plot and left the race, Ms. Schrader, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason to prevent her from running for the presidency.
“This decision was not well thought out,” she admitted to me 30 years later.
“The race was already attended by seven other candidates, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone named the case "Bellowman and seven Dwarves".
The campaign had already come to an end, and she was far behind in the fundraising process, so she swore she would not participate in the race unless she collected $2 million.
It seemed to be a completely lost option.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, only offered her 250.
“What do I do for them, appreciated goods, what?” she wondered.
When she spoke, declaring that she would not conduct a formal campaign, she was so emotional that she was grateful to the people who supported her, to the disappointment of the system, which had made it so difficult to collect money and access to voters, and to the anger of discrimination on the basis of sex that she had breathed.
"You'd think I had a breakdown," said Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
"It was possible to think that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking, what are they going to write on my diary?
"She's got no end of the sobbing"?»
How trade war with America can be beneficial to Beijing
The experts believe that the first waves of trade between the United States and China were deafening, and, while the battle is still far from over, the division between countries can benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, made the first warning at the beginning of this year by taxing major Chinese exports, including solar batteries, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week, when new tariffs affected goods worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), actually taxed half of all goods coming from China to the United States.
Beijing has each carried equivalent counter-attacks, most recently setting $60 billion worth of US goods in the amount of five to ten per cent.
China had promised that responses against the United States would be equal every time, and the second largest economy of the world would hardly begin to experience at least the slightest difficulty in the near future.
To force Washington to withdraw means to waive the demands, but publicly, the US would be too disgraceful for CJingpin, the President of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing is able to play its maps correctly, the United States trade pressure can provide long-term support to China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a speedy political solution in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to economic corruption in any of those countries is in fact much more dangerous than the observers previously acknowledged,” says Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Center for New American Security, a specialist in Asia.
Minister for Foreign Affairs said that Syria was “ready” to return refugees
Syria states that it is ready to return refugees voluntarily and seeks assistance in the reconstruction of a country that has been devastated by a war of more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem reported that the conditions in the country were improving.
“Today the situation on the ground has become more stable and secure thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The Government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can live peacefully there.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they had to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives have now been established.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would be grateful for its assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept assistance under any conditions or assistance from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe fortifies victory in the Raider Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Raider Cup, winning the U.S. team with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National in the outskirts of Paris, France.
The United States has already lost six consecutive times on European soil, and the European Ryder Cup has not won since 1993.
Europe returned the crown thanks to the team of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn, who gained 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who persistently fought most of the tournament, made his first long blow to the water on the 16th moon pair-3, giving his match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds, became the 1st-4 players who had ever walked 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit was defeated by a 5-4 player with the lowest rating on the European team, Turbjørn Olesen of Denmark.
One of the best players in the world, Dustin Johnson, joined 2-1 Jan Polter of England, who may have participated in Ryder's Cup the last time.
Spanish Sergio García, veteran of eight Ryder Cups, won a tournament in Europe with 25.5 points for his career.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't hold back today.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get a cup again.
It's a team thing, and I'm glad I could help," says emotional Garcia after a European victory.
He's handing over a torch to his compatriot John Ram, who won the US golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday with a score of 2:1 in a single game.
“I am extremely proud of this victory — I have grown up watching Tiger Woods play,” says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These figures are quite strange for one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 major titles, giving up only to Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. Congregation struggled all weekends in vain trying to succeed, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau, who showed the highest class golf course throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furick said after his team said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we managed to hit Europe slightly.
It didn't work.
We're taking our hats off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played great.
We'll regroup, I'll work with PGA America and our Kupek Ryder Committee, and we'll move forward in pursuit of success.
I love all 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We need to be able to lose.
We have lost.”
Red tide: news The concentration of micro-organisms declined in Pinellas, Manatas and Sarasote
The latest report of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission reflects a general decrease in red tide concentrations in some parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to FWC, there are abundant flowering reports in the Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier districts, which indicate a decrease in microorganism concentrations.
The red tide stretches about 130 miles [130 km] of coastline from the northern Pinel to the southern districts of Li.
Glasses can be seen approximately 10 miles from the Hillsboro district, but their numbers declined significantly compared to last week.
The red tide is also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, average concentrations were reported in and near Pinellas County, from low to high concentrations in the Hillsboro Coastal Zone, high concentrations in Manati and Sarasota Districts and in coastal zones, average concentrations in Charlotte County, high concentrations on the coast of Li District, and low concentrations in Collier County.
In Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier districts, there is still a potential for irritation of the airways.
No such probability was reported last week in northwestern Florida.
