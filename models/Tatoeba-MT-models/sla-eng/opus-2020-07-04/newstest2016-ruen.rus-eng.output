The social map of the people of Ivanov Region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The amendments provide for the maintenance of travel facilities in public passenger transport.
Since 24 September, the provision of a concessional travel of citizens using a social map of the people of Ivanova has changed.
According to the Russian Government's press service on the Ivanov area, the changes provide for the maintenance of public passenger travel facilities and bring the social map to a social map framework in line with the requirements of Federal Act No. 161 of the National Payment System.
At the same time, the social map of the resident of Ivanova is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application are changing.
For example, the limit of replenishment is now set, not on travel as before, but on money, with periods of winter and summer, not more than 400 roubles, but not more than 800 roubles for the current month during the summer period.
The social map holders will now need to track the balance of the money, rather than the remaining travels.
The cost of a concessional journey for citizens would be 1/2 of the fare in force with the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of travel is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The schedule of the social security map is still valid, from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new social map travel arrangements will have a number of advantages.
For example, it is possible to keep a detailed account of the expenditure on the social map, with an accuracy of the copies.
In addition, there is the possibility of the return of credited but unspent funds.
Add also that the schedule of calculations with carriers becomes transparent, as now half the cost of travel is paid by the citizen, and the same amount reimburses the carrier for the budget.
No commission will be charged on a cash map.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, Deputy Chief of Road and Transport Department of the Ivanov Region, reported that more than 33 million social map visits were made in 2014 and nearly 25 million trips were made in 2015.
The regional budget provides for more than 470 million roubles for the concessional travel of citizens using a social map.
As at 1 September, the amount for this purpose amounted to over 312 million roubles.
During a 911 call, a teacher admitted to murdering a friend
At a 911 call, the teacher at the university of Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that there was a need for staff to come to their homes.
Lamb emphasized that there was a dog in the house who was alive, but probably upset, and said that the contacts of the family members of the deceased could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a note written carelessly on a white sheet of laminated paper: "I'm sorry, I'd like to bring it all back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," says the note, according to the representatives of the organs signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who took two online courses at the University of Delta State in Cleveland, Mississippi, had been able to travel 300 miles to a university campus by that time, where police thought he had shot all respected history professors Ethan Schmidt at the threshold of his office.
The Chief of Police of Delta State, Lynn Baford, reported that the university staff found out about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb had made that real call at 911 shortly thereafter.
By the end of the day, the victims will be one more: Lamb killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The next day, after shooting at a school facility had forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, officials were still trying to put the motive behind Lamb.
Information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped to produce a portrait of a talented but possibly concerned teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to his classes.
The police in Gothi, where Prentiss died, reported that he was not charged with violence or criminal matters.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote, in which he expressed appreciation for the “fine people ” with whom he crossed into his teaching life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 teachers, and many students attended lectures by both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
One student who spoke well of Lambe, Brandon Bivers, said that he also seemed anxious and nervous, “like something was wrong with him”.
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb at the end of the school year 2014-15 had told him how he was coping with stress.
Before that, Lamb asked the Delta State University to give him a sick leave, said he had some health problems.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in university employment rules meant that the doctorate who had worked so hard for Lamb would not automatically ensure that he received a teacher's position.
William Laforge, president of the University, said that he had no knowledge of the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but “evidently Mr Lamba had something on his mind”.
These are questions Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
Police attacked after Lamb after he fled campus when he was heading back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself from a 38-calibre rechargeable pistol in the back yard of the house, about a mile south of his parents' house in the Greenville suburb of Mississippi, reported Washington Township coroner Mettel Johnson.
His engine was still on the driveway.
It was unclear why Lamb had come to this house, although Johnson said that he believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb started working at a university with 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12000 in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received a Ph.D. in the spring of the same year.
One old friend of Lamb’s described him as a smart, charismatic, and cheerful person.
Carl Hayerston told me that she was 15, and Lambo was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a cool guy older than he was trying to teach her how to play guitar for a few years.
In those years, he enjoyed the success of women.
All the girls used to hide when he was around," says Hayrston, who is now 40 and who lives in Jackson, Brandon's suburbs.
Lamb and Prentiss have probably been dating for some time.
During the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gothi in a Cypriot house whose opposite side is on the canal.
According to the police, the dog's fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Sean O'Stin, reported that they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and that they have a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"She's completely depressed," O'Stin told me about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he didn't date Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer festival three years ago.
Then they played concerts from time to time together.
O'Stin said his daughter wrote music and sings.
Prentiss was a nurse and worked online for various companies.
Mike Schaffer, the barman and a co-founder of entertainment programs in the shower-lit Bar The Jule Room in the suburb of Gothia, said he had last seen Lamba and Prentiss on the night of 5 September when Lamb finished playing guitar and a lip gun for a few visitors.
There was nothing suspicious.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We had fun and trained each other.
I mean, they were both very clever.
Schmidt, a deceased teacher, held seminars for first-year students and specialized in the history of indigenous Americans and colonial America, said Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English in the same educational institution.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at the University of Kansas, Emporia, and was president of the fraternity and student self-government.
On Tuesday evening, some 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and members of the community, participated in the Memorial celebration of candles.
Schmidt Liz's wife and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a ceremony during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The class will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," said Laforge.
Crisis's over.
Today's the day of recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped prepare the authors Associated Press Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with a police statement that Lamb's call came into service after Schmidt's murder, and that although Lamb spoke of Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer staff for the holiday season
Toys R Us reports that it will not hire as many staff for the holiday season as it did last year, while the player of toys and goods for children assures him that he will provide staff and temporary staff with more hours of work.
The company reports that it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and wholesaler bases throughout the country, which is less than the 45,000 who were hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company reported that it would start interviewing the applicants this month and would increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although the holiday season is still months away, the purchase season is getting closer and companies are getting ready to hire temporary staff to have enough state in the shops and for sale, shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is kidding about seeing Princess Diana.
"Back to the Future" premiered for Michael J. Fox as a great event.
She was also noticeable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royal family to arrive, and I noticed that the place next to me was free, and I was struck by Princess Diana sitting next to me," he told the documentary "Back in Time" in the trailer.
I'm starting a movie, and it's coming to my mind that I'm literally at the distance of my hand and in one false phone call from seeing Princess Welsh.
"Back in Time" is a documentary about "Back in the Future" film, which includes an interview with Fox, Lee Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zeekis and executive producer Stephen Spielberg.
The movie "Back to the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"For me, Spielberg says, this is undoubtedly the greatest movie of travel in time ever taken."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in some cinemas in October.
UN head states that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon responds to Russia's military support for Syria, which for almost five years “no military solution” and the increase in armaments will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The head of the United Nations once again called upon all participants, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Mr. Ki-moon stated at a press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet with the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent members of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that differences in the Council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, had “made the situation unsolved”.
Mr. Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they demonstrated in addressing the issue of the Iran nuclear programme and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 poll results that show Donald Trump's not gonna joke
Some of them tried to put a provocate label on it.
The others turned away from him, taking it as a joke.
And some people are asking for a scandal.
However, as some Republicans try to shake Donald Trump's position in the polls, they have failed (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys demonstrated Donald Trump's preference in two-digit figures, and some began to ask seriously what it meant to the magnet of real estate in terms of chances of obtaining nominations.
Of course, it's just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to nominate the Republican Party.
Experts point out that during this time, in 2011, Rick Perry gave up his surplus to Germany's popularity with Kane, none of whom had won a single state in the process of nomination.
And there are many reasons why he would have fought in general elections.
But outside groups, such as Jeb Bush's “Supercommittee of Political Action”, and the Economic Conservative Group “The Growth Club” recognize the irresistible power of the Trump and begin to get their dollars to overturn it.
Here are some of the numbers of interviews that say that the magnet of real estate is not just an intermediate phase:
Sympathy ratings for the Trump were turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his application in mid-June, a survey at Monmouth University showed that only two of the 10 Republicans had a positive attitude towards this magnet in the field of real estate.
By mid-July it was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, this was 52 per cent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans are positive for Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these figures are top-notch in the initial stages.
The Quinnipiac survey in Iowa last week revealed that 60 per cent of the Republicans were more likely to refer to the Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would appoint Trump as a candidate.
In a survey of CNN/ORC last week, 67 per cent of the Republicans said that they were either “welcome” or “welcome” if Trump became a candidate.
Only two out of ten say they'd be "disturbed" if he were a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent say they would be "welcome" against 40 per cent of those who say the same thing about Trump).
Next in line?
Marco Rubio, who has only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republicans say that they will be "not satisfied" or "displaced" if they favor the Jeb Bush nominee.
Most Republicans do not consider the Trump temperament a problem.
While the Mass Tram is criticized for its boasting and insulting, 52 per cent of voters across the country think that the Magnanat has the right temperament to be president, according to a survey of ABC News/Washington post held on Monday.
The same figure appears in the first closed assembly in Iowa State, where the same 52 per cent of Republicans think he has the same person as the chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 per cent think that he is not the person who can be effective at the post, and nearly six out of 10 independent voters say that his temperament is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post reports.
Republicans get used to that idea.
When they wear their stamp hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
To the question of who was the most likely winner in the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump was a favorite, according to the CNN/ORC survey last week.
This is no longer the case when four out of ten were placed on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters had never had a proper magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the past cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent supported a possible candidate, Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, this shows that many GOP voters find the Trump campaign convincing.
Even if the Republicans were to unite around another candidate, Trump would still be ahead of the rest.
Some signs suggest that such a variation is likely to favour the Trump, while those that do not support the Trump are equally distributed among the more than ten other candidates supporting the Trump.
But the survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September shows that in the hypothetical competition “one for one” between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump almost always receives the support of the majority.
He's ahead of Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points, and finally Randa Paula, John Casic and Chris Christie at 33 points.
He's got nobody with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate that cares about him?
Ben Carson chased the businessman to 19 different points in the hypothetical one-on-one competition.
A little over half of Donald Trump's supporters say they've changed their minds.
The new CBS/NYT survey, held on Tuesday, shows that only over half of the voters supporting the Trump say they are confident in their voices.
Obviously, much can happen and change the situation, and no one really can say that he will never change his mind.
46 per cent say they leave the door open to other candidates.
However, the most intense competition with Trump at the moment, with my partner outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but the voters who say they've changed their minds are likely to choose the Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump named immigrants from Mexico two months ago "violents" in his campaign, the topic of immigration has become the most relevant in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's pose will discourage key voters of Latin American origin from the republican party and interfere with the rebending.
However, according to the ABC/Post survey conducted on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration matters.
Therefore, as long as immigration draws the attention of all, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Disappointment by the Government is gaining new momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now counting on the support of approximately half of the Republican voters, mainly because of their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans on Monday, a new ABC/Post survey, state that they want a political outsider rather than a person with experience in government work.
And they're also insulted in Washington.
A survey of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed with the activities of the Republicans in Congress, with 54 per cent “unsatisfyed” and 21 per cent “in anger”.
The Government will decide the fate of pension indices in October.
Vice-Prime Minister Olga Gladets stated that the Government was now looking for options for implementing the pension indexation law in 2016 to a real level of inflation, the WG said.
It noted that the decision should be found by 8 October, by the time the draft budget was submitted to the Government for the following year.
In addition, the Cabinet is discussing the extension of the decision on the freezing of the Russian reserve pension.
The Hunger noted that the pension savings amounted to 350 billion roubles.
Approximately the same is true of the full pension index for the following year.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there is no final decision as to who should pay for non-working citizens.
Hunger is of the opinion that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not apply to socially vulnerable categories of citizens, it is not fair that society pays for him.
Previously, the media reported that there were two options for balancing the budget in the cabinet.
Why is it that the ages are often irritated and red?
Tatyana Levashov's Ophthalmologist responds:
Our centuries are wide, protecting the eyeball from the multitude of tiny particles that sit on them.
Forgetting the regular cleansing of the century, we often contribute to the development of blephrite.
Output simple:
Do not rub your eyes with dirty hands, carry a special wet napkin for centuries.
at least 1-2 times a day, cleanse the end of the century of the harmful substances stored in them.
Cleaning procedures should also be accompanied by warm compressions with herbs (shalfia, rosca) which ignite the thick secret of the salty glands and then massage the edges of the century, which should be carried out by circular movements of the pillows of the fingers;
Do not use alcohol - bearing products by washing makeup.
They dry and decontaminate the skin and further thicken the secret of the salt glands.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclear scientists have created an atomic warhead.
The North Korean authorities reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country, a nuclear complex in Yonben, was “full-powered”.
This was reported on the website of the country ' s Central Telegraph Agency.
It is noted that the DPRK is ready at any time to respond to “aggression and nuclear threat” and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “both in quantity and quality”.
The most recent test of nuclear weapons was conducted by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
However, plans to resume full reactor work have not been reported since.
Pyongyang claims that it has succeeded in creating an atomic warhead.
The DPRK has also tested medium and low range rockets, says Polit.ru.
Girinovsky demanded that the reference to brotherly peoples be removed from the Russian anthem.
LDP leader Vladimir Girinovski believes that the reference to the union of fraternal peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
He said so during the meeting of the House, he said, “Russian News Service”.
Who are these people now?
Fascists and murderers!
"A very long anthem, the longest in the world, even sportsmen can't stand," said Jirinowski.
The Deputy considers that all the quarters in which this line is to be removed should be deleted:
In the summer of 2014, Jirinovski stated that the current anthem needed to be changed to “God, the king of food, ” and the Russian tricolor to replace the imperial flag, writes Polit.ru.
Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
The President of Syria, Bashar Assad, urged all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe is to deal with the refugee problem, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is, not that Europe accepts or does not accept refugees, but that the root causes of the problem need to be addressed.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, they should stop supporting terrorists.
That's our opinion on the issue.
"That is the essence of the refugee question," he said in an RT interview.
We must continue our dialogue to reach consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are not possible as long as people are dying, as long as bloodshed continues, and as long as people do not feel fully secure.
"In this way, we can reach consensus, but we cannot achieve anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria," Assad stressed.
Recall that about 500,000 migrants arrived in the countries of the European Union this year, including from Syria.
The European Commission stated that the current migration crisis in the world has been the largest ever since the Second World War.
It is possible that thousands of extremist groups of “Islamic State” can be among migrants arriving in Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia can use the situation to establish their cells in the EU to carry out terrorist activities.
The inhabitants of the German city celebrated a holiday for the refugees.
In the past month, Germany has become a leader in the reception of refugees, although it has recently strengthened border control to contain their influx.
The authorities estimate that some 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts call it significant numbers.
Since early September, more than 90,000 refugees have already arrived.
Correspondent bi-bi-si Jenny Hill visited Darmstadt, where migrants are given very warm receptions.
Jeremy Corbin is debuting for the Prime Minister at the session.
Following Mr. Corbin ' s election, his debut at the Prime Minister ' s session is expected with great anticipation.
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbin, will be speaking to the Prime Minister for the first time at the session with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will speak with the first of the six questions raised in the afternoon; his statement will likely be followed closely by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He called for “less theatres and more facts” in a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that he could miss some meetings by leaving them to their colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbin as the leader; it will take place after the appointment of the shadow cabinet and his speeches at the annual Tread Union Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour Leader to remain silent during the execution of the national hymn on Tuesday, during the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain, sparked criticism by a number of conservative members of Parliament and became the theme of several leading articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbin ' s decision not to sing the public anthem attracted attention
Mr. Corbin, Spokesman, said that he had “standing silently” and recognized the “heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain”.
However, a member of the shadow cabinet, Mr. Corbin Owen Smith, informed the BBC 2 Newsnight that he would advise the leader of the Labourers to sing the national anthem “independently” of his conviction that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to play in Mr. Corbin ' s team, raising differences on economic, defence and international policy, while less than one sixth of the members of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
A BBC political correspondent, Robin Brant, said that political differences were also “buried” in the levies following Mr. Corbin's appointment as a European Union post and the Government's restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr. Corbin stated at the Tread Union Conference that the Labour Party had made amendments to remove the very idea of restrictions in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow Minister for Labour and Pensions said that the party had a “complete clarity” on the fact that it was in opposition only to government plans to reduce the ceiling from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the Labourers to meet David Cameron at the Curie Box in the last ten years since he became leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Labour Committee, who had promised a different approach to politics, said that he had “inculcated collective resources” to raise Mr. Cameron's ideas and had received over 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament from the Aylington North district said that the Prime Minister's questions were too confrontational and that he would refrain from the witty responses and the exchange of lynx instead of promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and problems facing young people.
Mr. Corbin said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Economy in the Shadow Office, would replace him with Prime Minister's affairs when he was absent, for example, when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also raised the idea of letting other colleagues take the floor if possible, saying that he had approached the Speaker of the Chamber of Commons, John Berkoe, to discuss the matter.
Having become a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to withdraw from the political style of the "marmochny Balagan", often associated with the Prime Minister's question procedure, but acknowledged several years later that he had failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister's issues have been a key indicator of the leadership's views, their ability to govern the House of Commons and the reputation of other Members of Parliament, although critics have stated that this has become a cartoon and requires extensive reforms.
"Sun in Johannesburg" Young Homeless People Learned From Photographers
Johannesburg Business Center is a difficult place for the homeless.

Pound sterling rises as wages increase in the UK
The pound has risen against the backdrop of growth in wages in the UK, with the FTSE 100 index rising thanks to the SABMiller offer.
From May to June, earnings in Britain, minus bonuses, increased by 2.9 per cent compared with the same period last year.
Growth rate has been highest since 2009 and has been seen as a shift to earlier projections of possible growth in the cathode rays.
The sterling pound increased by more than 1% in relation to the dollar to $1.5505 and 0.84% in relation to the euro, amounting to €1,3730.
FTSE 100 rose to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
Against the background, SABMiller shares were allocated, which increased by 20 per cent because of the purchase offer made by AB InBev.
The deal would bring together two of the world's largest brewers, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares increased by 0.9 per cent against encouraging news from the competing group of luxury producers of Richemont.
The latest sales data for Richemont exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China, on the key market for Burberry, were again growing.
Glencore stock grew by 5% after the mining giant declared that it was able to obtain $2.5 billion through stock placement as part of the debt reduction strategy.
The Mondi paper and packaging group shares were the leaders of the index drop by 4.3 per cent, after Goldman Sachs reduced the group's rating to “sell”.
Shares of JD Sports increased after a company supplier of sports clothing reported an 83 per cent increase in profits up to £46.6 million in half-year tax.
Chief JD Sports says higher wages can prevent expansion
Executive Director JD Sports Peter Caugil says that raising the minimum wage for British workers means “greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers”.
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power would outweigh the cost of labour, he said.
Costs could have affected plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash launches a bottom-up campaign to combat Aldi pressure
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA stores from the pressure of Aldi in South Australia and Western Australia.
The wholesale food supplier launched the IGA market share campaign at the bottom in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the upcoming inflow of Aldi $700 million.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 shops in South and West Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and promote the IGA brand by marketing in leading media and social networks and at Adelaide Show events.
The campaign is supported by IGA dealers and suppliers, such as Simmo's ice cream producer from Dansboro, who offers tastings in IGA stores, and shopkeepers selling permanent tickets to South Australia's football leagues with discounted permanent customers.
Metcash is expected to disclose more details of its protection strategy on 29 September - the day when this wholesale food, alcohol and household products provider will carry out its annual investor strategy day.
In South Australia and Western Australia, IGA branded stores account for almost 30 per cent of Metcash stores and show a higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in eastern states.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are known to be committed to the normal routes, so the market is more favourable to IGA dealers than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, more than 30 per cent in South America and 24 per cent in WA than in Eastern states, compared with about 14 per cent.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will reclaim 5 per cent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first shops, taking the volume of sales from all the players present, but mostly from independent retailers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, analyst Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA dealers can lose $360 million a year in sales and Metcash is $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in SA and 30 in WA next year, with sales of $500 million and 600 million in those markets respectively.
The loss of income and sales of food at high constant cost to Metcash could cost companies about 13 million incomes before paying interest and taxes, said Mr. Kirat.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states mainly because of Aldi and Colees, and this is because the recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley believes that food sales of Metcash will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing the market share of the company from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, a leading fund manager, Hamish Douglas, founder of Magellan Financial Group, observed at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash "can very easily disappear for a decade.
Metcash refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas's comments.
But it is expected that Mr. Douglas, a board member of the company Metcash, contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
The share of IGA in the market decreased from 18 per cent to 14 per cent from 2010 and the income of Metcash from the food business, which the company supplies to approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, fell by 43 per cent from 2012 due to the operational delegation and the pressure on sales and profitability.
Nevertheless, the company does not give up, spending more than $150 million a year to balance retail prices with prices at Coles and Woolworths at thousands of positions weekly and to assist IGA's retailers in the renovation of trading venues, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider choice of firm food.
Director-General Metcash Ian Morris said that the price equation and the improvement in the trade area was gaining momentum, and hoped that the company would achieve an increase in net profits in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakisa supports President Tennis Australia Steve Hilly
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves credit, not criticism for his behavior.
Tanasi Kokkinakis indirectly suffered in a recent scandal surrounding his friend Nick Kiryos and deserves to be read more than critics, according to President Tennis Australia Steve Hilly.
Kokkinakis, a young man in a talented duet and often referred to as “Special Ks”, became the focus of the shameless struggle of Cyrus with Stan Vavrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly after that, during the hot qualifying match at Cincinatti, the judge at the college had to have two differences between Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, and Harrison said, "Varrinka had to put on Cyrus' shovels, and I have to put on this guy's shovels."
Since the last time Kokkinakis saw a cracking rocket after the crash in his leg saved Richard Gaske from a possible defeat at the US Open, Hilly loyally defends Kokkinakis.
A young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grotto for the right to be the second after Bernard Tomić, on his own in the Davis Cup against the British semifinal.
"I'm very anxious about one thing, namely, what Tanasy got into the conflict," Hilly said.
He really broke the rocket when he had his foot down on the US Open, but he wasn't the first player to break a rocket when hope broke, and I know Tanasy was good enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he was very good at challenging situations in the US, with Harrison, etc., and I'm sure he deserves confidence.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a beautiful family, and I just think he's been a little unfair.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he works hard, he's an excellent team member, he's never had problems with other players, he's respected outside the court, he's been trained intensively, he's in excellent shape, he's a very dedicated and developed young man, and I think he should be evaluated in dignity.
Hilly also supported the decision to forgive Kiryos for an important match starting Friday, assuming a "cohesive consent" was the right way out for everyone, but hoping that the Canberra guy would return to the team as a long-term player.
"Most of all, we want the team to be completely focused on the match, not on the disputes around [Kiryos]," said Hilly.
And I think Nick gained power very quickly, which proves people like Federerer and Marrey, he's growing up in front of the public, he made a number of serious mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism that he's getting, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think I need to get him out of the centre for some time so he can think about them, and that's best for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary announces an emergency, closes the border, detains migrants
Having declared a state of emergency, Hungary crossed the border with Serbia on Tuesday on the southern border and detained those trying to enter the country illegally in order to contain the flow of migrants.
At the border, riots took place, with hundreds of migrants digging into border territory, where Serbian authorities reacted sharply.
Stuck for an indefinite time at a road site between the two countries ' checkpoints, people fleeing armed violence in their homeland broke tents and based on the area.
However, discontent grew.
When a police helicopter circled over them, migrants shouted, "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian police for special purposes.
Some objected to food and water.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia has declared the “inadmissible” expulsion of migrants back from Hungary when they are increasingly coming from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution to the problem, not the collateral damage.
It is necessary to negotiate with Brussels and other countries in the coming days”, said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The Hungarian-Serbian border wars began the day after the bloc of 28 countries had been unable to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 asylum-seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that, in the future (in the following month or end of the year), an agreement would be reached that the States members of the European Union would accept another 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angel Merkel and Austria requested an emergency summit of the European Union next week to discuss the immigration crisis affecting the continent.
Hungary, however, does not look forward to prompt action by Brussels or its neighbours.
Tuesday's state of emergency in the two southern regions gave the authorities more power to act on the crisis, allowing them to close roads and expedite asylum cases.
Meanwhile, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Siyarto, stated that his country was also planning to take a barbed wire from the border with Romania to cover the flow of migrants across the country, now that it had completed the fence on the Serbian border.
Correspondent CBS News Charlie Dagaga reported that even prisoners were connected to urgent work upon completion of the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main “strict place” and the European Union border crossing point for displaced persons, many of whom are refugees - victims of war in Syria and in the Middle East.
Nevertheless, the Prime Minister, Victor Orban, insists that the majority of the people who come to the country are economic migrants seeking a better life than refugees, victims of war that are entitled to protection, and that view differs sharply from those of other EU countries, Germany.
The new laws that entered into force in Hungary at midnight are now regarded as a crime of crossing or damaging a four-foot (13-foot) barbed wire taken by the Government along the southern border with Serbia and also include longer prison terms for those accused of trafficking.
“As a result of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government has declared a state of emergency”, Zoltan Kovac, a representative of the Government of the South City of Seged, told journalists.
We clearly understand that illegal border crossing is a crime.
Formally, Parliament still has to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but the Associated Press reporters, who are on the border, have already observed for several days the presence of armed soldiers before their teeth with vehicles and dogs.
Dierd Bacondi, Orban's National Security Adviser, reported that 45 persons attempting to cross the border at the very border and 15 others inside the country had been named by the authorized authorities.
They crossed the border by breaking the fence, are currently in police custody and are charged with administrative violations under the new laws.
Authorities are quick to restore the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven crossings on the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning, prompting a railway wagon wrapped in barbed wire to block one of the passageways.
The riots broke out on the main crossing of the border near the town of Ryoske, Hungary, as the Hungarians placed a service space for the passage of people inside the metal container, and crowds of people pressured one another to break in.
About 20 people were able to enter, and thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway leading from Serbia to Hungary and announced a denial of food and water until they were released into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders has been halved in the national survey
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold back a two-digit advantage in the race of Democrats for nomination throughout the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.
Clinton now has 47 per cent support for primary democratic voters (down from 58 per cent) and Sanders is second with 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential race, receives 15 per cent of the primary democratic voters.
More than five months before the beginning of the rivalry in the primary elections, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that they have decided with the candidate they will support.
The Clinton supporters are more confident of their choice than the other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton has lost support for some demographic groups, and Sanders has won some bonuses.
Clinton retains a great advantage among women and the moderate, but this advantage has decreased.
Its support for men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only five points behind it.
The preference given to Clinton by democratic voters under 50 years of age has disappeared, and they are now on equal terms with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton chased Sanders into a two-digit number among the liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point advantage in this group.
Nearly half of the primary democratic voters throughout the country say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a candidate for the party.
Four would support her with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would support her only because she was a candidate.
Six per cent would not support it.
It may not be surprising that the present supporters of Clinton are likely to be more enthusiastic about her.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, the views are more contradictory - only about a quarter with enthusiasm would support it.
While 48 per cent of the primary democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trampe (35 per cent).
When supporters of Clinton are asked the open question why they want to see her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the necessary experience (16 per cent), then that she is now the time of the female president (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate for the post (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters are also talking about an association that ties her to Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It is also referred to as an agreement on issues and a chance of election.
Since the Vice-President is considering potential participation in the elections, 57 per cent of the primary democratic voters would like him to join the race, although a third considers that he should not.
When they are asked who they would like to see in second place among the party's candidates, the primary democratic electorate is usually called Badena.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half said they'd pick Baden in second, that's more than Sanders's.
If Baiden decides not to stand for the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Baden among the participants in the race to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five per cent of democratic voters see a candidate in Clinton with the best chance of winning the general elections; however, this figure declined by 78 per cent last month.
According to this indicator, Biden has a large backlog, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate has increased.
However, responding to the question of what is most important in the candidate, democratic voters choose options other than the opportunity to be elected.
Similarly, last month, none of the candidates from Democrats or potential candidates was an unacceptable nomination for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have shown good results on some of the key characteristics among the primary voters of their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Baiden to be honest and trustworthy people with good leadership.
Biden of all three is a leader of honesty, and the strong side of Clinton is in her leadership.
Thirty per cent of the primary democratic voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and credible, twice as much as those who speak the same about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have any opinion on it.
The primary democratic voters also generally consider similar ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Baden.
In all of these measures, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
While questions regarding the personal box of e-mails and the Hillary Clinton server continue to exist for the Secretary of State, most primary democratic voters are satisfied with its explanation and do not believe that this has adversely affected their common view of it.
But that's a completely different story for the American public as a whole.
Half the Americans today are dissatisfied with her explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was shared in March shortly after this story became known.
Most Americans say that the controversy over e-mails has not affected their common opinion about Clinton, although 36 per cent say that their opinion on it has deteriorated.
They are mainly Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who claim that their opinion on Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton considers it to be an honest and credible voter from her party, it continues to be a problem for her among registered voters as a whole: only 32 per cent consider her fair and credible, eight points lower than last month and 15 as compared to May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not regard it as fair and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters throughout the country do not consider the Trump to be fair and credible.
Clinton and Trump both, however, receive good leadership marks.
Of the six protested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush show the best results in honesty.
Most see an honest man in Sanders rather than not, but, like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error limit for a sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson's national survey drew close to Donald Trump.
Ben Carson went to Donald Trump in his last survey of CBS/New York Times
The two candidates obtained half the vote in a new poll, leaving all others in search of resistance under their feet.
Republican voters throughout the country continue to support the Trump, with a 23 per cent increase in support from the recent CBS survey held on the eve of the Fox News debate last month to 27 per cent in Tuesday's survey.
But Carson took off in the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also showed that Carson enjoyed support in all demographic groups by pushing the Trump into the group of Republican voters with higher education.
The remaining candidates, with the exception of Carla Fiorina and Governor Ogayo John Kasić, turned back with Governor Wisconsin Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10 per cent last month to 2 per cent now.
The former Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Hakabi, and the Senator of Florida, Marco Rubio, together occupy third place with 6%.
The error rate for the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey was plus or minus 6 per cent, the survey was conducted in September.
A recent survey of CNN/ORC, published last week, showed Carson's growth in polls, showing 19 per cent support among Republicans, for Trump with 32 per cent support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post survey also showed that Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
Owing to Carson's growing support last week, Trump made several critical incidents to the former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning the Trump faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday at the end of the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity are charged with the death of Baruch College's freshman student.
About two years after the death of a college student during a fraternity ceremony in Pokono, Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
“Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity of the New York College Baruch attacked Chan Michael Denga during the September 2013 ceremony and did not bring him to the hospital on time, which led to his death”, reported to the police.
Officials say that the student with his eyes tied and a 30-pound backpack with a sand behind his back pushed several times while he was trying to reach his goal, going down the sliding surface.
Mr. Deng finally complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
P.D.'s fraternity members didn't call 911 when Deng passed out, and they were waiting for an hour to get him to the hospital, talking to the police.
They, however, took the time to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms in Google, and contact Andy Mengo, the national president of the fraternity, to ask for advice, as police chief Chris Wagner told the press conference.
“At this point, the members of the fraternity began to hide personal property, essentially by putting the welfare of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng’s health”, said Chief Wagner.
He couldn't be saved, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng received several blunt head, torso and thigh injuries.
“Too many families have suffered as a result of fraternity rituals, since at least one student dies during them every year since 1970”, said Douglas Fireberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
The brothers and their members must be responsible, and this step by the authorities is very important.
The jurors of Monroe leaned in favour of a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, will be charged with violence over new and criminal conspiracy.
“We want to bring to justice not only individual participants, but, if there is an organization that authorized all of this, officially or informally, it is also”, Wagner said at a press conference Tuesday.
The College of Baruch banned the fraternity, and the National Brotherhood expelled the local department from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There's going to be an increase in interest rates, and the bull market will stumble, the yield of the bonds will grow, and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it's going to take, and how long it's going to last.
In particular, history explains little about time for the economy.
The recession occurred only 11 months after the first increase in rates and 86 months.
The volatility of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, although not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
Therefore, the U.S. Central Bank administration stresses that investors should not focus on when they start raising their rates but on how much adaptation will take place.
In fact, there are a lot of variables in the game.
Eventually, however, market participants may find that all the vanity surrounding the increase in rates has been exaggerated.
“The first increase in the rate of the Federal Reserve in the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the cheap money era,” said Julian Jessup, chief international economics specialist in Capital Economics, in his comments to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of interest rates in the United States to a more normal but still low level will be a seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here is a view of how some areas of the economy could respond depending on historical trends:
As the market has seen in the last month or so, expectations of higher rates may lead to volatility for some time.
However, the consequences are usually not so dramatic when the rate is increased.
“It does not seem that the revenues from the shares will slow down 12-24 months after the first jump, which, again, probably reflects the delay in monetary policy”, said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of interest increases by the Federal Reserve.
If more specifically, the market has changed sharply over the past 35 years - about 14 per cent - towards higher rates, it remains sufficiently flat for 250 days after that (average 2.6 per cent growth), then, after 500 days, returns to an average of 14.4 per cent in the last six cycles, according to Bob Doll's recent analysis, the main trade strategy specialist in Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
In Deutsche, it is said that the result for securities is not immediately becoming more pronounced at the rate increase, and the revenues from shares are beginning to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but higher rates often contribute to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed under conditions that have not existed before and can accelerate the recession.
The majority of gross domestic product will be located at almost the lowest point in the history of the increased rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases, only twice the nominal annual GDP has been below 4.5 per cent since 1950.
Even though it was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it is too long, with only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed.
The increase in rates on such a volatile economic background could be risky and the question “will this be different” was reported in Deutsche.
Market participants are preparing to raise the Federal Reserve rate throughout the year, with their views attached to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends Thursday.
As long as many policy experts and economists believe that FOMC could approve the increase in rates at this meeting, future trade suggests only a 25 per cent probability.
“In our study since 1950, all the cycles of increase in rates to date have been in the supercycle of the growing financial leverage in GDP, which overlaps peaks leading to recession, very quickly since the start of recovery”, the report says.
In contrast, it was a very slow recovery after the worst recession in the chosen period.
The current cycle is the longest that the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months; it has been all 74 months and is not yet over.
The fixed income also became volatile while the market was waiting for higher rates, and this scenario was somewhat similar to what was being done for shares.
The fundamental difference is that bonds have a faster effect than shares when the Federal System changes the strategic course.
In the case of bonds, the yield seems to change the vector immediately after the first increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the increase in interest rates, the yield of bonds immediately drops," Deutsche said.
Strategy specialists from Charles Schwab believe that higher rates will lead to longer-term and short-term yields coming closer, making the curve more flat.
High-income bonds often behave better in such a climate, although “we are still afraid of fluctuations in yields”, says a study by Katie Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of the Federal System policy.
“In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflationary expectations, there are indications that the market has become more robust in monetary policy”, she wrote.
The interest rates on short-term loans rose, the yield curve increased, the credit spread increased, volatility increased - all market characteristics in tightening the Federal System policy.
Generally speaking, companies operating their main business in the United States will benefit from higher interest rates and local production will become more attractive.
International companies with many debts will be at a disadvantage, as the growing dollar makes their products more expensive in the world market space and their debt more expensive in financial terms.
“The story shows that “quality” shares demonstrate the effectiveness of the above market within three months of the initial increase in rates”, Goldman Sachs said in a client report.
Firms with a stable financial state have missed the volatile performance of each increase in rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns as well as low volatility shares also showed better performance than low quality shares, on average 4 (per cent) and 3 (per cent) respectively.
Debt will be a big question.
Companies with a high rate of debt will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely trading transactions, consumers will benefit from a growing dollar.
Depositors could also see profits through higher yields, although experts differed as to how fast this would happen.
"BBC Radio 3 - Classic FM copies" - approves parliament member from conservatives Andrew Bingham
Conservative Parliament member Andrew Bingham criticized the station for “decreasing standards”
Proves that it is becoming less and less different from a commercial competitor.
He's also targeting BBC Music Awards, saying that the prize is just soded with the Brits.
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins, who attacked The Voice with the same criticism, was not original
"BBC Radio 3 is becoming Classic FM," said Parliamentary Leader, encouraging the radio company to prove that it is doing something that commercial companies do not do.
A member of Parliament from conservatives, Andrew Bingham, also told the BBC leadership that it seemed like a public radio station was "stupid" and becoming less and less different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems -- I don't like to use the word "forgive" -- but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards Award launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, look like The Brits in a different name.
So if you're trying to do something else, here's two examples that first came to me in which you're actually just copying what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General of BBC rejected the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was going far ahead of its commercial rival when the case involved live music and audience education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anymore.
And his devotion to live performances and music will no longer be like anyone else.
"It's also very important, I think, that Radio 3's interest in finding new music and moving forward new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davy claimed that radio stations had to work much more to attract audiences than in the past, because British people were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only child of BBC who had been attacked by commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
A member of Parliament from Tori Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a musical talent show that BBC bought from the Dutch Talpa Media for an estimated 22 million pounds sterling price.
See why this program is often discussed because of its lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, in which Paloma Feith and Boy George participates as judges, was made in the "standard BBC style".
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find a hit in its own stable" the next time she started a fun project.
However, he did not consider it necessary to prevent the ordering of the new seasons of The Voice in the future or the use of the money of those who paid the licence fee to other entertainment formats.
The growth of Internet sales slowed as much as possible in August, and Black Friday could be responsible for that.
The first three months of 2015 saw an increase of 7 per cent in online sales
Last month has seen the slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile shopping devices
Experts are convinced that November's Black Friday could help to contain losses
For about ten years, virtual shopping has been booming, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost cities.
But experts say that there are signs of online sales comparisons now after the latest data showed only a 7 per cent increase during the first three months of 2015.
The overall cost of online shopping in August has shown minimal growth since it began to be fixed in 2000, only increasing by five per cent.
Experts say that there are now signs of online sales comparisons after the latest data showed only a 7 per cent increase during the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rate in previous years and go back to 2000 years, they have always found a reasonable explanation," said Guardian Andy Malkhahi, editor of the IMPG sales index.
He explained that online sales had intensified three years ago when buyers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that even more people were able to buy online, and that they could do so under any conditions, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it's on the plateau, and you can see the decrease (growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that buyers may have refrained from buying on the eve of the event that took place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times as fast as average buyers rushed to computers to make use of profitable offers, thus undermining a number of sellers ' websites.
Experts believe that when buyers engage in the real fight for profitable purchases, Black Friday could have made people refrain from shopping
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, nearly £1 out of every 5 sterlings are spent online.
For goods such as TVs and washing machines, more than one third of them are sold through Internet stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than fashion stores on central streets.
Muslims bury the dead when the crane falls in Mecca, and Ben Laden's family is penalized
Muslims carry 29 dead bodies across the street, as the first funerals begin in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partly blamed the accident on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 persons were also traumatized following the collapse of the tap
Hundreds of Muslims from all over the country were flocking to bury 29 of the victims of the kangaroo’s destruction on the main mosque of Mecca.
Clothed mainly in white, attending funerals filled the carriageway to pay tribute to the first of the dead who made their final trip to the cemetery of Al-Moaiss.
The burning procession passed past the sacred place, where, in just a few days earlier, the construction crane had broken through the ceiling of the mosque and had fallen into a stranger.
The bodies were issued for burial, and at the same time King Saudis fined a construction company belonging to Ben Laden’s family for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 dead in the collapse of the crane in the Main Mosque carried on the streets
One of the dead was the father of four children, Kasim Akram of Bolton, Great Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Main Mosque with his parents before the annual hajj.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj in Mecca will continue, as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left the arrow of the crane raised in the unworkable tap.
The Arab version of the decree published by the State agency Saudi Press states that Binladin Group bears partial blame for the violation.
The English edition of the news agency did not report this detail, but reported that the leaders of the company had been banned from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the cause of the fall of the crane in the courtyard of the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered to go to hajj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives were not available for comments.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of non-use of modern security measures and inadequate coordination with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Main Mosque of Mecca, as part of the extensive construction work done by the Binladin Group.
The Ben Laden family has been among Saudi Arabia ' s immediate governing family for decades and has been managing major construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaida, Usama bin Laden, was a foster son whose family had renounced in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in strong winds and rain just a few days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in pilgrimage, which is compulsory at least once in life for every working Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 people remained in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million rials (about Pound174,000) to relatives of the deceased and the same amount to be irreparably mutilated.
The remaining victims will receive half of that amount.
Chapter B&Q asserts that the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European workshops working for small amounts of money
According to Veronica Lori, the British are increasingly recruiting repair specialists.
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is increasing
Result - more than 200 new Screwfix stores for professionals
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q warehouse stores across the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, lead city correspondent Daily Mail
The British are said to be setting aside hammers and painting bones, and instead recruiting qualified Eastern Europeans to carry out housework
If you can handle a hammer or paint a wall gently, you seem to be in a minority these days.
Because, according to the B&Q company owner, the British are increasingly recruiting craftsmen to do non-complicated work on the house.
Veronica Lori, the new Director General of Kingfisher, who owns a network of home repair services, reported that this trend was followed by a substantial influx of skilled Eastern European craftsmen offering services at minimum prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix shops specializing in workshops and simultaneously close 60 B&Q warehouses.
Ms. Lori said that she would like to see more women in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten shopping decisions were made by low-sex representatives.
Currently, most of the staff are men.
She said that the latest demographic trends, characterized by an increasing number of single-women households, which were more active in housing than in the past, could not be overlooked.
Mrs. Lori said, "Our stores still have men working mostly.
There is a need to take steps towards achieving balance.
In general, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on purchased goods are taken by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Lori, one of the five women who run leading British companies whose shares were included in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the team of top managers by achieving equal numbers of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which 50 per cent of managers are women, including the Director-General and Finance.
Ms. Laurie said, "This was a conscious solution, diversification is an important issue for us.
It was easy to find suitable women in the board of directors.
After the group took over shop closure costs, Kingfisher showed a decrease in profits and sales volumes for six months.
As a result of this trend, the Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new shops.
Time of decision at the United States Federal Reserve rate
The world is watching a meeting of the Federal Reserve Bank that discusses a major decision within two days - whether or not to raise the interest rate for the first time in the last decade.
A survey of 80 Reuters economists found that just over half of those who thought the Federal Reserve was going to do so last week are now assuming that it will slow down and keep the rate at the current range of 0 to 0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time, we are thinking that the main bank can move from zero and start the process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Murder, a leading member of the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
The U.S. economy is working effectively, the economic recovery adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the solution will affect the world economy.
He warned the markets that they should be prepared for change, but they all say that they are confident that all the chances are against such a step.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
The new Balkan route: refugees are going to the EU through Croatia.
"Open up!" is a scandal of hundreds of refugees at the Horgos checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungary border.
On Tuesday, Budapest crossed the border for the displaced.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to trace other routes to the European Union.
One of them is crossing the closed border with Serbia through Romania.
Another is through Croatia and Slovenia to Austria.
According to some data, the buses that drove refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the city of Shidu on the Croatian border.
Drivers have been ordered by the authorities to follow without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stepanovic assures that his country is doing its utmost to help the refugees, but her capacity is limited:
Our job is to secure Serbia as far as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to ensure humane treatment.
But this is already a pan-European problem.
It is not easy for any country in Europe to deal with it alone, and even more so a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open a border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban is unfavorable:
If someone is called a refugee, he must fill out the necessary documents in Serbia.
And if he doesn't, they won't let him into our country, because it's safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already carried out 175-tilometers on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop it; he plans to build the same barrier on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Ingelis Maimarakis: "Europe wants to help us."
Over the years, the Meimarakis has been part of the law - centre governments, which, according to the left, have led the country to a financial crisis.
Now, he has become the interim leader of the New Democracy party, challenging Cyprus.
A few days before the elections, he met with a journalist, Euronius.
Mr. Maimarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Ingelis Maimarakis: Thank you for inviting me.
Euronius: Nine months ago, your party suffered a devastating defeat by giving up the SIRISA coalition, but now, according to polls, "New Democracy" has been compared to it by popularity.
What changed in time?
Ingels Maimarakis, Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Cipras lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and prospects for economic growth.
The country ' s budget deficit and high unemployment rate again.
Investors left because Mr. Cipras drove them away.
In the past nine months, the Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises made by Mr. Cipras.
And now they can easily compare what was promised to what had actually happened.
Daily life was markedly worse than in January when the situation improved, with the majority of Greek citizens concerned.
Euronius: But you say that if you win the election, you will seek alliances with other parties, including Siriz.
Ingelis Maimarakis: The point is, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in operation, the political forces and all the ruling parties have gathered together to implement the programme on which they have agreed without giving up their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at this stage only the cooperation of the political forces and institutions will enable the country to move forward.
Euronius: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Cipras and the creditors of the country.
If you become the new Prime Minister on Monday, will you comply with this agreement, or will you try to change it at least in part?
Ingelis Maimarakis: In fact, we voted in favour of Greece's movement on the European path, because we are well aware of the devastating consequences of leaving the country.
Europe is now helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, the Juncker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All of this would have been lost if there had been no treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were the result of Mr. Cipras negotiating.
I know Europe doesn't want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek Government wants to bring about order within the first year of its life, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am sure that all commitments made that cannot be fulfilled because of what leads to recession can be renegotiated, but only after a certain period of time.
It would be wrong to believe that, in the first year of the new agreement, we would be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they were awaiting full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to restore their confidence, we must continue to privatize, reform and structural changes that have been agreed upon, continuing to benefit from EU funding and the great investment opportunities that we must provide for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, in the course of the negotiations, the Government of Cyprus has not presented any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we have found in discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give an example of farmers' income.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be taxed in full in advance.
We were told that the Ministers of Cyprus never talked about it.
I mean, the Greek ministers were unprepared and poorly informed, and therefore failed to negotiate and conclude a failed agreement.
Euronius: If you win the election, you will soon be at a table with Mr. Juncker, Holland, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them be different from what your predecessor Antonis Samaras told them?
Ingelis Maimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014, we were trying to do our best to implement the 2012 agreement, bypassing the sharp corners of the agreement.
We have moved on to reform.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted under extraordinary circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price that the Greek Government had made.
I was the Speaker of Parliament at the time, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups, which were then the governmental majority.
And despite their serious ideological differences over key bills, we had a working Parliament, in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations outside.
And we have managed to bring the country to a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the early general elections resulting from the December presidential elections.
Euronius: The recent weeks in Greece have seen a massive influx of refugees.
How do you feel about this situation and about the reactions of the European countries in which these people aspire?
Ingelis Maimarakis: The refugee crisis is a deceleration bomb that we have to deal with after we win the election.
The reason is that the Government of Siriza did not act in this situation as it should.
Such matters should be taken ahead of time, for if you are faced with a problem, only emergency measures remain.
And we are now in a situation like this.
Even the temporary government that replaced Siriz had done more in just seven days than Mr. Cipras had done in seven months.
I am sure that these actions by the interim Government, which is being given valuable assistance to the President of the Republic, who called for the EU summit, will make it possible to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country, and notice that refugees are illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the Syrian war, the victims of some of the extraordinary events that have occurred to them.
There is a deep humanitarian dimension to this issue, and we will stick to the position that European policies must take in this new situation.
The relevant decision must be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations must be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border controls and refugee reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to cope with this pressing problem.
Mr. Maimarakis, thank you for the interview.
Ingelis Maimarakis: Thank you.
In the Peace City of Družkovka Donetska District, the police chief's search for the area, together with a military counter-intelligence, identified and detained a suspect who was 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the town of Krivo Rog (Dnepropetrovsk district), who, on the eve of the evening during the joint use of alcohol, and the conflict in the village of Verhnetoretsk Jasinovatsina district, was fired from the machine in his opponent.
A report of a 22-year-old boy's injury came from a hospital where he was hospitalized with cross-fired legs.
As Artem Wasicki, Deputy Director of Criminal Investigation of the Police Head of the Area, during the course of the operations of the law enforcement, proved the involvement of the figurer in another serious criminal offence - the killing of a 41-year-old resident in the same village.
The operatives found that on the same day there was a conflict between a suspect and another local resident that led him to inflict a deadly gunshot wound to his head.
Criminal proceedings under “Intentional killing” and “Intentional infliction of serious bodily injury” of the Criminal Code have been opened by the DOJ investigation department.
The detainee is in danger of being deprived of his liberty for 15 years.
The figurant was detained and placed in a temporary detention facility and reported to the Donetsk district police press.
Two citizens of Novosibirsk, who painted several Soviet monuments in the colour of the Ukrainian flag, including two of Vladimir Lenin's monuments, were sentenced by the Russian court to imprisonment.
Two other residents of the city were sentenced to restrictions on their freedom.
Prisoners of Novosibirsk were sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years ' imprisonment.
Two other convicts were sentenced to 14 and 18 months ' imprisonment.
The Leninski Court of Novosibirsk found four citizens guilty of vandalism in respect of the Lenin monuments, which were located in the vicinity of the KPRF and on the street of Trikotažna, as well as the Monument Slava Memorial complex.
In the latter case, the Katyusha and T-34 missile installations were painted.
Recall that on the night of 12 December, in the Russian Republic of Novosibirsk, the unknown painted military equipment in the colour of the Ukrainian flag on the Monument of Slavia.
The civil spouse of the popular Russian actor Evgeny Tsiganov Irina Leonov gave birth to the seventh child.
The girl appeared in the light of a Moscow clinic.
The newborn and her mother feel good.
Remind me, the Gypsies and Leon break up recently.
Evgeny refuses to comment.
Irina is blaming her husband and his ambitions.
Evgeny Gypsiesov 36 years old.
He's an actor at the Master's Petra Fomenco Moscow Theatre.
It's famous for "The Walk", "Cosmos as a Sense", "Brest Fortress", "Ottepel" and "Farca".
On 8 September, Evgeny Tsiganov was recognized as the “Acter of the Year” and “Man of the Year” on the version of the Russian version of the popular GQ magazine.
A man who opened fire at Delta State University left a note apologizing.
After the shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning -- and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day -- Shannon Lamb wrote a note stating that he was “sorry” about the first murder and would like to “all return” to the authorities on Tuesday.
The police in the town of Gotie, Mississippi, report that a geography and social science teacher at the University of Delta, called 911 about 10 a.m.
Monday, and he said he shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police needed to send people home to him.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there was a dog in the house who was "no one touched" but probably upset.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but he didn't call him.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened fire.
Upon arriving at the scene of the crime, the police found Amy Prentiss' body, 41, and the hand-written note from Lamb, 45, which stated: "I wish I could return everything back.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to the University of Delta State, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on Monday, when he was surrounded by police, killed himself.
The Rector of William Laforge University reported that he had no knowledge of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but “Mr. Lamb obviously had something on his mind”.
Despite the information received on Monday about what Lamb meant by the Prentiss-Schmid affair, official services reported on Tuesday that there was “no information or evidence” of the love triangle.
Sean O'Stin, who said he was married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they became friends.
O'Stin told me that he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19, and that she was "comfortless".
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Lindsay Knowles, the newspaper San Herald calls a close friend of Prentiss, the last one working from home online.
Knowles told me that Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lightning and that she had been dating Lamb for about three years.
Noulz said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called his family on Monday at some point to say that he would not go to prison.
On the night of the same day, when the police caught him on the road “1” near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of her, fled to the woods, and shot himself there.
According to a summary posted on the university website, in the spring of 2015, Lamb received a Ph.D. in Education at the University of the Delta State.
Stars Lost in Success
The actor (left), in a photo with his son, Redmond (right), has lived several difficult years.
In 2001 he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his multi-year companion, Farre Fosett, who died of cancer.
The actor was also reportedly addicted and was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly played a part.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United left for months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the League Champions match, where Manchester United lost PSV in Andholdoven.
While the lawyer is concerned about this, which makes him unable to leave for at least six months, Louis van Gal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again in this season.
The trauma occurred during Hector Moreno's reckless handout at the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV fine zone.
He was assisted in the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gal said, "He's got a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be transported to Manchester tomorrow or the day after, and then operated on.
It's terrible - a young man came to Manchester United at 18 years of age, got through a lot of difficulties and started playing fantastically, and that's where it happened.
It had an oxygen mask on it in the dressing room.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's for six months, and the guy can't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card and no penalty.
Arbitrary Nikola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexicans.
Van Gal thinks the Italian judge made a mistake.
You judge for yourself when I say it's worth a penny and a red card.
It was a very bad two-legged knockout.
In his tweet Shaw writes, "Thanks to everyone for your messages, for not describing how devastated I am, my path to recovery is starting, I'll be back even stronger than I was."
Also on the topic: Manchester United is having an accident with Luke Shaw in defeating the PSV game
The English defender will have an additional incentive to make amends to the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Koku, trainer of PSV, said, "This is a very serious injury."
When any player gets away with this trauma, they're all very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to traumatize their opponent.
Moreno moved his leg when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team under the leadership of Van Gale at the 2014 Peace Championship.
"He's having a hard time now because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear that this is a very serious injury, you feel bad," Koku said.
I didn't get a chance to see the moment myself.
The only thing I could see was the ball that flew in the other direction, so it looked like he touched him, but I didn't see the horseshoe under Luke.
In an interview with SBS6 Moreno said, "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to carry it.
It's really hard, and I'm sorry.
Andres Guardado from PSV was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Smallling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Larax?
Every parent takes one thing very quickly: if your child likes a book, it'll be a little while before you know it almost by heart.
Apparently, unless you're David Cameron.
In response to a question by the representative of the child rest company on vacation about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose “Lorax” as a story of the environmental bias written by Dr. Suze in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a commentary published on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "This is a funny, touching, unusual story with a strong message I love to read to my children because it always reveals some image or message that we miss."
And all would be good, except for the last paragraph in which Cameron is supposed to recapture the contents of the book, but he's actually telling the story of a single-name movie that was filmed in 2012, with new characters and details added in order to reproduce a rather short original story.
"In a city surrounded by high walls of the town of Muyunzville, where there was no green and even air sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, a girl of his dream, by fulfilling her desire to see the present tree," we read a description of the love story, unknown to Dr. Suzu (the present name of Theodore Suz Geisel), who died in 1991.
If this seems suspicious enough, Cameron's text reads almost as a brief presentation of the film "Lorox" on the Internet Web site "Movie Database": "In the high walls of the town of Muyerville, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, a girl of his dreams."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, as an active parent, is so ignorant of the contents of a book in which an unnamed boy learns how to destroy the environment by a greedy tree cutter and a nasper-gatherer, Findkins, despite the protest of Laurax (whose name appears in the title of the book) is a ridiculous substance with a mustache who “speaks on behalf of the trees”.
Most likely, such a simple PR task was assigned to a performer who never read a book about Laurax 20 times in a row.
The representative, Downing Street, said that the text was allegedly obtained from Cameron's office in the constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text had been obtained from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comments had been received.
Adam Lit was clearly at risk of not getting into England, but it was still a difficult question.
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the collection that England has selected for this tour, the repetition of the 3-0 test series that happened last time doesn't seem likely to me.
I wouldn't rule out winning in my field either.
Alistair Cook's team may be less experienced than what was three years ago, but in it, there are players who are virtually playing ball and collective thinking; they will not bring scars from 2012 but only boys' positive.
With Moen Ali's ball, it turns into a bowling bowling ball, and Adil Rashid, even if it is an unknown figure for the test level, is an attack option.
Also on topic: Adam Lit left England for a test cricket and replaced by Alex Hals
The decision to exclude Adam Lit to me, his main coach in Yorkshire, of course, is difficult to analyze.
His seven test match had two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the obvious but cruel reality was that cricket players were judged by judges by the result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I've said this before) the players best choose themselves.
A couple of hundred, and Lita could have waited for a longer career, but he was in power of his own destiny.
We hope that if he does more wounds for Yorkshire, there will be another possibility.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, spoke well of his mood, even when he didn't show what he was capable of, and that doesn't surprise me; first of all, he's a team player, and then everything else.
The question of how long it will be before the batsman of the test crykkat gives the impression is a complex question.
Lith played seven games, like Sam Robson did before him, and Nick Compton played nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play in his or her own field.
The only thing you could complain about is England chose Jonathan Trutt for the Caribbean Premier League when Lite was in the best form, but this lost opportunity was in the past.
Alex Hales shows up, and he's a beatsman I appreciate very much.
He's an unpredictable cricket player that we saw at the Yorkshire Club at the beginning of this season, when he earned 236 in the match against us at Trent Bridge Square, which was something.
It should at least be given the same opportunity as those before it, but this will certainly depend on the team's composition in the UAE.
The idea of putting Moan next to Cook as an opening for the Batman would give us an extra spinner, keeping four speed boulevards, thinking about it, and I'm not against it at all.
I don't see why a beating player can't hit a ball there, and this left hand has already shown that he's a damn good cricketer.
Moan may not be exactly what it takes for his county of Woostershire, but he's become number three for them, and there's no big difference here.
My old friend on Justin Langer's team played his first 38 test match "third bat" before he came out as an opening in 2001.
He won three hundred straight away and didn't look around.
Zafar Ansari comes to the assembly as a spare pinner, and in my brief communication with him, he appeared to me to be a very promising young man.
People can look at his exemplary statistics -- on average 31 with a beat and 35 with a ball -- and think it's a risky rate, but among the spiners who vote "for" a little, and those who choose youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the collection, England plans to make a few practical additions to the training composition.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardin, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a test match consultant, could be a master's move.
He's one of the best guys in the game who'll bring in her the richest experience she's had under all possible circumstances and in all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood is included in the games where the white ball is used and will ensure both energy and spare speed in the set.
I have always felt that he was born to be involved in an international scream, be it a game or a coach, and, like Mahela, has great intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what they have said before, can give new forces to the team.
Colleague of the Darem Ben Stokes team is left for a day, Ruth is given a similar break in connection with Australia, and I, for example, do not have problems.
Although not all agree, players and players do not set a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on results.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
The British exit camp from the European Union can win if the economy is depressed by 2017.
The thoughtless policy of David Cameron to resume negotiations on the preservation of Britain into the EU is becoming increasingly difficult every day, even without regard for the election of genius Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" -- Corbina, the leader of the Labourers, or the disapproval of TUC for Europe on Tuesday.
Aliens also have their own Corbins and Nigel Faraj.
A friendly European diplomat explained in the days that, in the situation in which the EU is now experiencing a variety of crises - not all of them in its own production - some of the participating countries of the sojourn of the British egocentric range of spreading concessions and undermining agreements that they largely do not want.
Having met in Brighton for an annual meeting, TUC decided that he did not want them in any case if they were destroying social protection.
We could even call this the "Selfi Dave and George" programme.
The Prime Minister and Minister of Finance are travelling at summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photographing themselves against the famous local monument, in or without the local celebrity, and then coming home and saying that they attract allies to reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to be interested in maintaining the outside contacts of Britain under the umbrella of the European Union - “Don’t leave us with France”, said Berlin - suggests that the Chored Ministers and Officials in some capitals come to an understanding of when they will still be, whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, a very cautious chancellor of Germany, is an ally, but she is in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before the situation worsens for her, as she has worsened for those in her seat, Thetcher (11), Mitterran (14) and Kolya (16).
The head of France, François Holland, stands before re-elections or replacements in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland may soon obtain a nationalist right-hand drive Government, Spain on the left.
It's hard to see them crawling out of the skin to help the brittles, whose energy could have been spent on preventing Scotland from leaving Britain -- which they also don't want because most people have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may even plan to release SNP-style handbags deliberately during the British referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up Britain's withdrawal from the EU, my friend suggests.
"The review was an idea-fix" and "Britania got nothing valuable from the renewed negotiations".
Europeans are aware of the predatory nature of Fleet Street, and how sceptical about the EU are the Magnate media, unlike Tony Benn's 1975 referendum, which supported our entry in 1973 by a ratio of 2:1.
They may be embarrassed to remember Boris Johnson, the entrenched Euro-opportunist, celebrated by his "direct EU bananas" by a Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his nonsense, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a company with fearsome tax evasion, telephone hackers and non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was all about them, but he was aware that when you're in a box with a boar of gorillas, you have to give her bananas to distract her and not let her eat you for lunch and again with tea.
In fact, Milliband was more committed to Blair than to Blair himself in opposing Cameron's idea of a referendum, as Blair applied principles in favour of the cancelled EU Constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him a winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him.
But my dear Jeremy Corbin, who snuck on my back in Westminster on Monday-- I told him that he doesn't have time to spend it on me-- seems like he's risking repeating Neil Kinnok's strategy of "Fighting Merdock" of the '80s -- a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but it should develop a consistent strategy for interaction with the press - not with me, but quite precisely with Andrew Marr, on whose couch at the Air Force he was sitting on Sunday.
Corbin's official position on Europe is what I call "evolutional."
He said he would like us to remain in the reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditionalist trend of Ukip and a wider range of “little England” parties to the story could probably say yes.
It's the same thing as Hilary Benn, but not Bennith," Benn said on radio and TV this week, and his internal Boy Scout refused to acknowledge that Corbin's insidious John McDonnell's "tiny" minister of finance was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father was all-powered on TV for his disloyalty to the Labour Office colleagues, without going too far and losing his office in the Cabinet.
The Battle of Hillary was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain "under all circumstances" is Benn's phrase, not what McDonnell said, not what J.C. told the judges and members of Parliament at a private meeting on Monday night, in general terms.
In order not to tell a Democrat and his boyfriend Corbin -- remember, he even touched me -- the discipline of messages remains important in the lifetime of 24 hours of television for seven days a week, especially in the water gate of social networks, the section of paranoia and betrayal.
It's wise not to let Cameron get away from Europe so easily, allowing him to accept as proper the support of the liberals during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbin's main error with regard to EU membership, within the framework of the Banitian economy of a doomed fortress, is no longer a question of esoteric discussion among left dissidents, for whom narcissism, which is a minor difference, is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
With regard to his error with regard to Nato Tom Watson, J.K. will not advocate for withdrawal, foreign diplomats will have to try to bring this to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - on Britain's concessions when it might all be pointless?
The United States has already been very disappointed by the weak military activities of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Government of the Republic of Korea is cutting down the costs, as I was reminded on Monday during lunch at a single forum called British Influenza Security.
Experts criticize the review of electronic cigarettes from Public Health England
Government-funded statements by the agency that 95 per cent less harmful than smoking were made at a meeting of 12 people, some of whom were related to tobacco industry, according to researchers.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electronic cigarettes.
The PHE published an important report, the "return tower" last month, calling it "a comprehensive review of evidence".
However, some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the relationship of some experts with the tobacco industry.
In a editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month, they criticized the “extremely fragile argument” on the basis of which PHE built its main conclusion.
In article BMJ, two other researchers asked whether these statements were “solid or inflexible”.
Martin McKee, a professor of European health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, reported: “The fundamental principle of health - rules should be based on evidence of effectiveness”.
According to them, the public expects PHE's statements that “the best estimate currently shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95 per cent less harmful than tobacco smoking” are based on a detailed examination of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this is derived from the only meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a multi-criteria decision-making model to summarize their views on the harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in the scientific publication.
McCy and Capewell reported that one of the sponsors of the assembly was EuroSwiss Health, whose director-general was told that he had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed the health certificates of BAT in the sustainable development report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, without mentioning the funding reportedly received earlier from Philip Morris.
There was no reasonable explanation for the selection of members of the Board, but there were several well-known supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of which also claimed to be financing the industry in the publications.
It is not known whether other participants have experience in tobacco management.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco manager at PHE.
A scientific article published by the group “extremely agrees” that there is a lack of “extensive evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most of the criteria” was written by McKey and Capewell.
However, none of these links and restrictions have been addressed in the PHE report.
McCy and Capewell reported that PHE's statements that “there is no evidence to date that electronic cigarettes are expensive, child or non-smoking” are premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Head of Health and Welfare at PHE, said that BMJ statements had been answered earlier.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco."
One of the two smokers died of his addiction all his life.
All evidence implies that threats to health from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the distant consequences.
PHE has a clear responsibility to inform the public of what the evidence proves and what the evidence does not prove, especially where the public has doubts about the relative risk compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people a year die from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs 2 billion pounds a year.
Having made it clear that, although electronic cigarettes are not safe, they only cause part of the harm caused by smoking, we are carrying out our tasks to the nation.
Former head of Channel 4 believes that BBC should terminate the EastEnders series.
The former head of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that the BBC should stop producing programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would give a lot of money for successful shows such as the soap opera of the Albert Square.
Johnson noted that licence fees should only be used to create programs that are not produced by other British radio companies.
He criticized BBC for putting public broadcasts, which most likely sees only a small part of the audience, on peak airtime when competitors have high ratings, and on channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noticed that he, in his time for six years, had unsuccessfully tried to cooperate with BBC during his work on Channel 4.
“I cannot separate myself from the idea that the BBC is preparing for launch and broadcasting transfers that could show competing non-subsidized companies”, Johnson told members of the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of a follow-up to the BBC.
If you keep the licence fee, which I do not consider to be a good solution in the medium and long term, companies should be left on the air only to those programs that are not issued and are not going to be issued by other companies.
The Voice Show is on the air in a premium slot because creators want to get as much support as possible for the future.
The idea of no one else showing it is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go to fund transfers that could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is one example of this, EastEnders is another; it is widely known that they are their own production.
Other channels would certainly give up a lot for her.
I don't understand how this could be a public broadcast.
I don't think that would humiliate the BBC somehow.
The serial entrepreneur Johnson, who headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of following the ratings “because of staff ambitions and because of their belief that this is the best way to secure long-term support”.
His comments on the most popular show in BBC echoed with comments made by Sky Tony Bolla, who, in his lecture on the memory of McTaggart in Edinburgh in 2003, suggested that the BBC sell EastEnders series.
Johnson noted that lower public BBC transfers “continue to go to BBC4, where the audience is often unaccounted for, but the company's function has been fulfilled, and this can be presented as an argument in the hanx sermons justifying the revenue from licence fees of £4 billion: 'Yes, of course, we do all these incomprehensible transfers that no one can watch'.
They put them in a slot where no one will ever look at them.
Regarding the licence collection, Johnson informed the Committee: “I urge you to find a more regressive system with regard to who receives the most of it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year is a huge amount, but for people who have 150 pounds is big money, I'm interested, they think so because they don't really look and listen to the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 Executive Director, who also addressed the committee last Tuesday, said that the BBC should review the Rita mission in favour of “information, education and entertainment”.
He noted that only a small portion of BBC productions were now formally classified as educational, he said, it was 1% of the television content and 0.1% on the radio and that the company should take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto of “information, education and entertainment”.
With regard to the Elstenstein partnership, it was noted that the BBC should make greater efforts in such areas as the Spring Concerts (only a part of them appears on TV), as well as in alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for online viewing.
Sonogenetics allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves.
The video shows how the nematodes change direction at a time when they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists have removed worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction at a time when they are affected by sound impulses, too high for the human ear to hear them.
The pulses have an effect by activating neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
More importantly: Researchers control brain activity by light
Scientists have reported that worms demonstrate the potential for a new technique called “sonogenetics”, which is based on the use of ultrasound to induce certain cells of the brain, heart and muscle, with the source of ultrasound outside the body.
Shritt Chalasani, a scholar at the Institute of Solca, La Haya, California, told the Guardian that this technique could one day replace deep stimulation of the brain, an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent into the brain and used to treat Parkinson's disease.
Nematodes usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they were beginning to react when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He discovered that bubbles are fuelled by ultraviolet waves, which then penetrate the worm’s body.
The enhanced ultrasonic waves affect structures called the ion channels TRP-4 found in the membranes of some worms.
Ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open and trigger cells that are related to them, as reported in the Nature Communications report.
To create the nematodes that can be managed by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications to the worms, so their motor neurons used the ion channels TRP-4.
During the use of ultrasound to influence modified organisms, the sound waves were strengthened by microscopic bubbles and inserted into the worms by activating modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to that used in the optogenetics, a new direction that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons by light pulses.
Chalasani argues that, compared to this methodology, sonogenetics may have some advantages.
Unlike the light that comes to the right section of the optic fibre brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves pass through the body’s tissues unhinderedly, so they do not have to go inside the skull box for delivery.
“We believe that, for the treatment of certain neurological diseases under clinical conditions, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses can temporarily make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasound signal”, Chalasani said.
He added that the method could also be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
Prohibited torture equipment is on your doorstep!
Announcements made fun of the British arms trade
Look at Amnesty International protesting the arms exhibit.
Amazing killer drones!
Ruining needles of iron candelaves!
Cluster bombs!
Electric light and noise drums causing insurmountable pain but leaving no trace!
A generous voice and cartoon leave no doubt that this advertisement of the largest international arms exhibit, the unique parody prepared by Amnesty International, to draw attention to the intention of the British Government to “touch” the weapons of repressive regimes, using the demonstration of defence technologies and security systems at the ExCeL centre in Doklendes.
More on: DSEI arms exhibit: authoritarian regimes are on their way to London
But the special campaign also causes the sudden appearance of multiple posters on bus stops and subway trains requiring a second look at them.
"The important DLR announcement from 15 to 18 September?" is written on one of them in the London Metro with the image of the DLR line turning into a silhouette tank.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers will be on the line of DLR. Passengers are asking to help prevent the display of weapons.
300 posters were painted by artists who exhibited their work at the "Frequent Design Museum" at the Banksy "Dismaland" Park.
A collection called the Special Patrol Unit helped to distribute them to London using a "advertising hacker" 6-pound set of wrenches, which is said to be "accessing about a third of the advertising space on the planet's bus stops".
London's transporters were unhappy with such "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody announcements issued by the Special Patrol Unit.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and professor at Essex University, artists are more demanding and seek to bring political art to an audience outside the gallery.
Many artists start working with protest activists, realizing that they have to go to the real world for the sake of their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against an arms exhibit welcoming passengers to the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times per 24 hours on Facebook and created by VCP for bono, with the help of a graphic designer and sound artist, also working free of charge.
The creative director of the VCP Matt Lever was struck by the advertising silence surrounding the arms exhibit, with a pass in the ExCel calendar, and thought, "Let's give them a campaign that they're trying to avoid."
They thought of creating a more realistic and cunning corporate advertising, but “filling her homes with bright colors and animation has proved to be a more exciting exercise”.
"They were incredibly helpful in drawing our attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition," said Tom Davis of Amnesty.
We now need the British Government to take measures to ensure that this torture equipment is not illegally sold directly at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art on arms exhibition comes from ExCeL, where participants trade fantasticly euphemistic products.
In the Saab press release, she leaked information on the order of the "AT4CS RS for shoulder shooting" from the US Army.
It includes “a non-conforming cumulative warhead that carries an unexplained armed action inside the target”.
Whatever he does, it won't be nice.
Eight golden rules in student dormitories
It's been 11 years since I moved into student dorms as a normal 19-year-old still believing in bereavement and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the strained smiles of those I annoyed and the numerous, long complaints of others.
Most of what I've learned can be broken down by eight simple rules.
Moving to a dorm can vary from a slightly nervous to a totally frightening one.
He encourages you to talk: tell people where you've taken your academic leave and where you've spent it, to support Corbin, and why you're "honestly, I don't love, I don't hate "Marmaite," because, seriously, guys, it's just a cleavage excrement HAHAH, I'm going to be there."
Get over it.
And help others to rest too, ask questions and show interest.
That's what keeps you talking, and helps you find people you like, not people you wouldn't even talk to, even if you had rabies, and they were handing out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms are often turned into drinking places, midnight cinemas, and common crowds, but they are also the place where people dress and fix underwear.
Also on the subject: Don’t even think about starting school at the university when you’re in a relationship
Introverts in universities are treated unfairly.
Your room should be a safe haven, but many dormitories form a culture of roaming from one room to another, which contributes to friendship, communication and leads to long friendships.
It could be hell for someone who's trying to restore power.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to keep friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I've been able to restore the energy I spent talking to you."
Try to feel tired with the conversation, not knocking on it, but texting.
By the way, about the knock: do it.
A guy in my dorm followed this principle: If the door was not locked, he was invited in.
He saw something.
Start friends by baking.
Since you're starting your university life on top of the popularity of the Bake-Off show, you're knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself and present a plate of chocolate cookies, it's not that weird anymore, it doesn't remind you of the 1950s with their "Welcome, we're neighbors, I've baked something for you, and now smile, and I'll ask you personal questions."
Offering home meals is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and eventually your face will be associated with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good a baker you are.
Bad blinded mosquitoes of flour, sugar, and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be sleeping when you knock on them.
The theft of food is a typical crime in student dorms.
Of course, taking someone's chicken is stealing, but isn't it stealing a little milk for tea?
Deal with the owner of the milk.
Most likely, he will suggest that you stay calm even if the inside boils with rage.
If someone's stealing your stuff, it's annoying, and I feel sorry for you, but try to talk to this adulterer than my neighbor, who poured liquid into her milk to wash the dishes, to avenge those who took him without asking.
She's in prison now.
You must not make noise that prevents people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a good person, but also because you're the same people from the glass house story.
The girl in my hallway asked the neighbor to make the sound of the drum and bass guitar because it was three o'clock in the morning and she had an exam this morning.
The neighbor responded by increasing the volume.
When he finally shut up at 5: 00 a.m., she kindly let him sleep for two hours and then cut his music and locked the door behind him in a three - hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband settled in the same dorm as you?
On the contrary, it wouldn't be extraordinary, before biting elbows, if you took a neighbor as your future wife, dragged them in, broke their relationship, and should have seen him every day, and perhaps watched him drag all your common friends on his side?
Of course, you can't tell the heart - but if the hot neighbor is not your future mate, try to cool your own dust a bit.
At a very exciting moment when you realize that someone left the keys inside their own locked room, the line between playful and grassier than you think.
Good play is fun, but it turns out to be the opposite in seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting security lesson by hiding something, but don't ever pack someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close the other person's door and put the keys in the glass of water that you'll then put in the ice cream - but don't glue other people's things with the Blu-Tack glue to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: how to install a new iPhone operating system after the Apple update
The new operating system can be requested by using the Settingss application to select the General and then - Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will allow you to jump and locate it.
Some encountered problems after installation when an error was reported to them that “Renewal of the annex” could not occur.
In order to avoid this, it is recommended that users either wait until they are reinvigorated or try to recover from iTunes.
The clues on the phone will allow you to complete the whole process.
The process may include the removal of applications to increase the space available, but Apple minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the amount of update, and also simplified implementation with a special utility, which proposes deleting the annexes and re-establishing them once the process is completed.
It is worth making sure that your phone is loaded or is next to the charger in order to prevent battery discharges.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, as the discharge of the phone in the process may lead to a failure of the update.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity by telephone.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian colleague, Sergei Lavrov, to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support given by Moscow to President Assad only exacerbates the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not going to talk about this with a Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
The edition of the PJ Media reports this.
“Secretary Kerry made it clear that Russian President Assad’s further support posed a risk of aggravating and prolonging the conflict and has a negative impact on our common goal of combating extremism - if we also do not continue to focus on finding solutions to the Syrian conflict through direct transfer of power”, said the US State Department.
They also noted that Kerry reiterated the commitment of the United States to the struggle against the Islamic State in a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member of her.
In addition, the United States “will be pleased with the constructive role played by Russia in its attempts to confront the Islamic State”.
Last Friday, representatives of the White House stated that they did not know exactly what the Russian forces were doing in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the matter with Moscow.
After all, White House Spokesman Josh Ernest noted that the time for telephone calls between President Barak Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had not yet come: “When the President decides that phone calls with President Putin will benefit our interests, he will raise the phone and try to make the call.”
Barack Obama himself believes that Russia's decision to increase the support of the Assad regime is a “game rate”.
I remember talking to Mr Putin four or five years ago when I told him that it was a mistake that Assad's further support would only make things worse.
"But he did not listen to my warnings - and as a result the situation deteriorated," said the President of the United States.
Imported yachts will be exempt from customs duties.
Micro-economic development intends to temporarily release incoming yachts and other floating means for recreation and sports from customs duties and taxes.
The relevant changes to the list of concessional goods for temporary duty free import have been prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
Elena Lashkin, Assistant Minister for Economic Development, reported on this.
In June 2015, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, following a visit to Crimea, directed a number of agencies, namely, Mintransa RF, Mine Culture, MID, MES, FSB, FTS, Rosturism, to prepare proposals to create an enabling environment for yachting in the coastal zones of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their ships abroad - approximately €200 million annually are being executed by European States for maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
Russia's mini-economic development has prepared a draft decision by the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission on the modification of the List of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes providing for the full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other floating means for rest and sport.
In the Ministry ' s view, this would certainly contribute to creating an enabling environment for the development of yachting in the coastal zones of the country, said Lashkina.
This issue was brought before the Sub-Commission on Customs Tariff, Non-tariff Regulation, Foreign Trade Safeguards of the Government Economic Development and Integration Commission, which met in September, and was also endorsed by the agencies following the discussion.
As noted by the representative of the Mini-economy, the proposed measure for full conditional release on importation is essentially a concession.
Therefore, following the adoption of the protocol, the Sub-Commission meeting in the Government of the Russian Federation of Micronesia will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for Discussion with EEA member States, Lashkin, explained.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from customs duties, taxes, includes goods necessary to facilitate foreign economic activities and international cooperation, for applications in the fields of science, culture, cinematography, sports and tourism, for international assistance, and others. Among them are office equipment (personal computers, typewriters), test equipment, drilling equipment, stage suits and decoration, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skis, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and objects for religious observances.
In the press service of the Mintrans RF “Revelations” reported that mandatory regulations had been prepared on the seaports of Kerchi, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Eupathia, which provided for simplified arrangements for the entry and exit of small, sports sailing and pleasure craft into the seaport.
The Mintrans has been entrusted to the captains of the Crimea seaports to ensure the application of simplified arrangements for the entry of small, sports and pleasure craft into the seaport and the entry of listed vessels from the seaport.
Mintrance has also prepared draft decrees by the Government of the Russian Federation on the approval of the borders of the seaports of Crimea.
With regard to Yalta and Feodysia, orders had already been issued, the others were in the process of being agreed upon, noting in the press service of the department.
According to Mintrans, the Government, classification and examination, the registration of small vessels used for non-commercial purposes should be carried out by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia it is extremely difficult to ride because of a poorly developed infrastructure.
Looking south of Italy and France, it is an ongoing industry with a large number of people involved.
In Russia, it's actually all there.
Our coastline is small, the only piece that can be operated around the world — the Black Sea in Sochi, Helenjik, Novorossijska, Anapa.
But the big challenge is that in this area, strict rules of border service are very strict: to go for a walk, a mass of permits must be formed.
Besides, inside Russia, you even had a place to fill up.
Two days she can go with her fuel, and then the problem arises where to take it, says the Sales Director of Nordmarine Denis Novikov.
With regard to yacht storage sites, there are now special yacht gangs up to 30 metres in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The yachts are also sent to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany for storage.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers were rich people, but the demand for yachts declined with the start of the crisis.
The World Bank has granted a $500 million loan to Ukraine.
The World Bank approved a new $500 million loan project for Ukraine for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press of an international organization.
“New funding will support a number of priority reforms in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine”, said the communication.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Cimiao Fan, said that banking sector reforms would help restore credit in the real economy and would stimulate economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and at the World Bank had observed the first signs of stabilization.
Due to the seriousness of the problems, however, Fan calls on the Government of Ukraine to accelerate reforms.
The Polish Government has previously approved the granting of credit in €100 million to Ukraine, conveys "RIA Novosti".
In prisons, individual blocks for transgenders are requested.
The Public Council of the Federal Penal Service (FSIN) for the protection of the rights of convicted persons in October 2015 will discuss, among other issues, the possibility of setting up separate clusters for transgenders and transvestites in colonies.
Vladislav Grib told the councilman about this.
In his view, depending on the total number of non-sex convicted persons in Russia, it is possible in domestic prisons to provide separate cells, blocks or even (if there are many such criminals) with a view to creating a special colony for transgenders.
However, Vladislav Grib stresses that it is possible to impose punishment on citizens in such isolated places only after convicted persons have undergone appropriate medical examinations that will prove that the offender is indeed a person identifying himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the isolation of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the safety of serving sentences.
He said that the proposed practice was successful abroad: there were separate transgender chambers in the SISO (where the accused were before the court decision) and special units in the correctional facilities.
Today, it's the only way to work with such criminals.
They clearly need to be isolated, because the presence of transvestites and transgenders in ordinary chambers is dangerous to them, it is suffering for their families and the sea of problems for FSIN staff.
The humiliation of the trances by the cellists is guaranteed, says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on the size of the city, how many criminals with unspecified sex should be counted on where to distribute them.
SIZO doesn't need certain things, just cameras, jail blocks.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgenders.
As the Grib explained, 50 or 100 people can be found in the bloc, and if a specialized unit is established in Russia alone, transgender prisoners can go there from any region.
Citizens are detained in the SISO at the scene of the crime, so the arrival of transvestites or transgenders from other actors in the investigation and trial is unrealistic, while introducing such practices for convicted persons in a separate colony - yes - says Grib.
Remind me that on the eve of the day, law enforcement officials were unable to decide which male or female inmate was detained for possession of drugs by 24-year-old transgender Dmitry Kojucova (known as Aline Davis), which made it clear that a male with a virgin was not arrested.
He was released from his home under a non-departure subscription.
This news has been widely discussed in social networks and the media, as there is indeed no mechanism for transgender content in SIZO and colonies in Russia.
Russian human rights defender, LGBT activist (LGBT - lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgenders) Nikolay Alexev supported the idea of creating special places to be punished by transgenders, noting that abroad it is also possible to define people in a colony - male or female - depending on their own wishes.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, that's a very small percentage, but there is a problem, as is the question of providing security in prisons for homosexuals, says Alexiev.
Prisons should be safe, so separate blocks could be made for that and for homosexuals, especially because they are more in prisons than transgenders.
At the same time, Alexeyev doubted that there would be many citizens in Russia willing to give themselves up as transcecsuals in order to get into a different colony.
Of course, medical examinations can be introduced before people are placed in a transgender colony, but not always clearly.
For example, in the United States, one of Chelsea Menning's prisoners looked like a man, and in prison he said he wanted to change the sex, said Alexiev.
A man can feel anything.
However, while there are no separate places to punish transgenders, I doubt that the prison staff will be seriously concerned about the safety of such persons and the delicateness of their orientation or sexual identification.
At the same time, an international expert on reproductive health in the territory of the RF, Boris Lordkipanidze, noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transgender offenders into the colony could delay the initiation of sentences for convicted persons.
A commission is being created, it's a matter of sexology, and psychiatrists have been conducting long-term observations, and it's not the only test on the basis of a high-level conclusion.
Today's psychiatric facilities allow this to happen.
Therefore, and before sex replacements, potential patients always undergo such tests - they clearly indicate whether gender replacement with surgical intervention is the necessary measure, said Lordkipanidze.
However, I find it difficult to imagine how to introduce this system to convicts, since the average of this survey is one month.
The doctor, while generally supporting the establishment of individual transgender units, also doubts that, in the current economic environment, it would be appropriate to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical expertise, transgender units in Russia.
It is difficult to think that there are no official statistics, but given that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, it can be said that there are fewer transgenders, and those who have such deviations and also commit crimes, a very small number, said Lordkipanidzee.
At the request of the homosexual colony administration, transgenders can now obtain separate conditions of detention.
Mikhail Antipov won the junior chess championship.
In Hunty Mansiesk, the world chess championship among the juniors has ended in 20 years.
The ending of the primacy was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last tour, and they became Russian Mikhail Antipov, who was able to catch up with the Pole Jan-Kashtoph Doudu, who seemed confidently to be taking the title.
The girls were celebrating the victory by Ukrainian chess player Natalya Bux.
The World Chess Championship, which had been held since early September in Hunti-Mansiysk, had lost almost all its plot by the middle of the tournament, since the representative of Poland, Jan-Kshishtof Douda, who had delivered a series of four victories (surgeries taking place on the Swiss system in 13 tours), had taken the lead in confidence.
Given that Douda was a primary rating, while it was considered to be one of the most promising young chess players, the probability that he would miss the extract was very small.
And even when Douda cut back and allowed Russia's Mikhail Antipop to reduce the delay to only 0.5 points, he remained an obvious favourite in fighting for the title.
In order to catch up with the leader, Antipo must have won the 13th tour.
But even that wouldn't help. Win Doude your party.
Plus, this obligation of victory could have affected the game of a Russian chess player and led to unmandated mistakes.
Thankfully, Michael Antipos avoided them.
He was confidently able to deal with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he was forced to wait until he finished his party with Doud, who met Benjamin Bok.
Fortunately for Antipo, the Polish chess player made a stand against the Dutch man for nothing.
Thus, Antipok and Doud gained an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipok had the best additional indicators.
That is why the leadership of the Hunta-Menzii Autonomous District, the governor of which Natalya Komarov has traditionally given great attention to the development of chesses in the region, has given him a major prize.
And here's the thing about girls dating an intriguing ending.
The leader of the tournament, Natale Buxé (Ukraine), was not enough to lose the title in the last tour, what she did with success.
Thus, the victory of the Russian woman, Alina Bivol, prevented her from catching up with Bux.
The Russian athlete remained the second with a 0.5-ball championship backlog.
Excess the regional structure.
The company joins the Volga and Ural regions in one of the major Volga-Ural regions, Siberia and the Far East, in the East region.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
As CEO Mikhail Freewin pointed out, changes are being made to “stay a strong player in the market” to develop the company “in new, not always favourable external conditions”.
In an interview with the Russian 24 Television Channel, Mr. Freedomin explained that they intended to reduce the "ten per cent" of the staff in Russia.
The security guard checked 78 Moscow's Burger King snacks and issued 367 prescriptions.
As a result, a restaurant on Volokolamsk road was fined for 50,000 rubs, and a 90-day closure on the Big Tulip street was made, but resumed work after the removal of all violations.
43 snacks violated the requirements of the premises.
Among other violations, inadequate sanitary and sanitary facilities, non-compliance with ventilation facilities, some found a group of intestine bacteria.
Francesa on the brand Burger King belongs to the OOO "Burger Rouss" owner of the network "Schocoladnica" by Aleksandra Kolobova, 293 snacks are working in Russia.
Igor Artemyev, head of the FAS, stated that the anti-indexation agency, by 10 per cent, of freight tariffs and the provision of public goods, as requested by OAO RZD.
First they wanted 17% of the indexation, now they want 10%, and also multi-billion-dollar budget grants, he said.
We say it's wrong, it's too much, reduce your costs, learn to save money, give up expensive property, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money on the left and right.
He added that FAS had its “very stricter” proposals, which were currently being discussed in the Government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net accounting option from Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of the execution of a flat-stock pouch for $300 million, the gold company reported.
In this case, Polymetal will have to add Sumeru to $80 million (the difference between the sumeru and market quotations) that can be taken from the free cash flow.
Sumeru has until 3 October to implement the option or to demand additional payments.
The details of the negotiations in Polymetal do not reveal.
The option was concluded as part of the purchase of Polymetal of the Kiesil project in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stasishin, Director of the Ministry of Housing Policy, reported that the Ministry, together with the CB, was developing a system of sanitation for the builders.
“We understand that we are not doing anything about it, so we are developing a mechanism,” said the official.

The second draft is a more complete version of the script, the third is the final design of the film.
Minpromtorg: targeted food aid will not be the equivalent of cards in the USSR.
The Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia, Victor Evtuhov, reported that the targeted food aid programme would not be the equivalent of the U.S.S.R. food distribution card system.
These are modern-day food aids to the population and support to an effective domestic producer.
I'm asking you not to speculate on the word food card.
In particular, we would like to point out that the proposed food maps should not be confused with the backlog of the total deficit, the distribution card system where the number of products received is adjusted.
We have so far proposed the concept, if it is approved, we will propose changes to the legislation," said Mr. Eutuhov, TASS.
Previously, "U" had said that a programme to introduce food cards for the poor had been introduced into the Government.

The president of Rosgosma wants to divorce his wife.
The well-known source informed RAPSI that Danil Hachaturov, president of the insurance company Rosgosstrach, had filed with the Moscow court a motion for the dissolution of the marriage to designer Uljana Sergienko.
The trial case of the judge of the world will be considered on 16 September.

President RJD Alexander Bobreshov is leaving his post.
Vice-President of OAO Russian Railways (RZD) on Corporate Security Alexander Bobreshov leaves the company, reports Interfax, referring to the source.
Vice-Prime Minister of Russia, President of the Board of Directors of the RZD Arkadiy Dvorkovic said that the issue of leaving RZD Alexander Bobreshov initiated a new Head of Company Oleg Belozerov.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, staff changes in RZD management are not related to the change of the company's head.
In the past, "U" reported that instead of Vladimir Jakounin OAO RZD headed the first Deputy Transport Minister for Peterburger Oleg Belozerov, who was serving a financial bloc.
The new head of the company announced reforms in the monopoly for the first time: in a year and a half, they will create a new system of freight tariffs.

This year, the Russian Management Association's Top-1000 Russian Managers study is 16th.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian senior managers, the study results in the work of Russian managers for the year by identifying leaders in the sectors and functional directions.
The start-up pool of candidates consists of the winners of last year's rating.
The winners of last year are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate for the rating of the current year and to nominate members of their management team.
In addition, up to 10 new managers from other companies are proposed for each of the initial candidates included in the list, which would be useful for adding to the overall pool of candidates.
The following managers of the company's functional directions may be nominated: Financial Director, Commercial Director, Marketing Director, Director of Staff, IT Director, Director of Public and Corporate Relations, Director of Relations with Authorities, Director of Corporate Governance.
Each expert is invited to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to present its management team and up to 10 new managers from other companies.
Industrial nominations are based on industry classifier of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forest and forest processing industry, machinery, media, metallurgy, multidisciplinary holding, professional services, communications and telecommunications, services and production of consumer goods, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant shall be provided with a login and password for entering the website www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information about the remaining participants and may assess the criteria proposed for each function.
The rating methodology is based on the “Better choosers” principle: top managers evaluate top managers, and functional managers evaluate functional managers.
Such a principle allows for the best possible assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating shall be adopted at expert commission meetings.
All applicants for the current year ' s rating and multiple candidates for the rating of past years are invited to the meetings of the expert commissions.
The Commission is organized on a functional basis: the Commission for Approval of the High Leaders List and the eight Commissions for the approval of managers of functional directions.
At expert commissions meetings, it is proposed to approve the lists submitted alphabetically (the places remain strictly according to the Internet evaluation and are closed information prior to the publication of the rating) or to update them in accordance with the list of standby candidates attached.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the rules of the "U".
At the time of publication of the rating, possible changes in the status of managers and companies.
The comfort rate for investment is 10-13 per cent.
Experts estimate that the small and medium-sized business lending market in January-April of the current year was 40 per cent.
What do you think is the situation today?
After panicky sentiments at the end of 2014-2015, the lending of the IAS has declined significantly.
The reason is understandable: a sharp increase in interest rates.
No one benefited from 25-30 per cent of the year's credit.
If the bank had previously been able to put all its potential problems at a higher rate, from delays to non-returns, it would not be possible to do so now: the rates and so cloudy.
For the business, the current level of loan rates for the IAS is not comfortable.
For much of the investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their return on return.
The 10-13 per cent rate would allow businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns.
To what extent do you estimate that entrepreneurs' demand for credit is met?
The situation has improved slightly since the CB drop in interest rates.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, it is observed that clients have been much less likely to apply for credits.
Above all, business does not understand its prospects for development and future revenues.
Today, business is one way out: we need to learn how to work on today's economic situation in the country and in the region.
We need to monitor the current results more closely, monitor the movement of money.
At the same time, if financial resources are available, new technologies should be used to upgrade equipment, reduce production and energy costs.
All of this ultimately allows the company to make the product more competitive and to keep the business even in a volatile economic situation.
What major lending market trends will be strengthened and will affect its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for lowering the average rate would depend largely on the policies of the Central Bank, and the regulator is now demonstrating consistency in the question of lowering the key rate.
However, the radical downturn in the loan price for the IAS is not worth waiting for.
In the current situation, the problem is primarily inflation, which makes it necessary to increase the interest rate to generate real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even at lower rates of CB.
With regard to the level of delay, small and medium-sized enterprises, which are traditionally limited to both the ability to replenish money and the option of adjusting economic behaviour, would certainly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I would not expect a substantial reduction in the share of bad credits.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That's exactly what Mazda says by Japanese hieroglyphics.
Beautiful, lacconic, and at the same time quite difficult for those who are accustomed to Cyrillic or Latin.
So is the new CX-5 crossover, as well as any other model of the brand: without excruciatingly attractive outside, technically perfected inside.
Japanese simply by virtue of their “Japanese” are able to bring attachment to the products of the Risen Sun to the state of full excitement.
There's a lot of arguments you can argue about in favour of cars from other countries, and you'll even agree in principle, but the whole conversation will be based on the final phrase, "But it's a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about!
Such people should probably love not only technology but also all other Japanese.
Quoting from Basse's move, fixing wasabi's food, collecting catanas and putting on your girlfriend -- no, not kimono, of course, but canyons of Japanese street fashion: nice, creative and very unexpected.
Perhaps Japanese schooling is the only form girls have enjoyed after school.
It has amazing properties: both sensitive and strict.
The older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of CX-5 is the radiator grid with five horizontal lines.
But where the shape of the car changes more strongly, a new drawing of headlamps and rear lamps that are instantly recognized by the car’s flow of cars.
As before, Mazda CX-5 looks very seductive.
Siluet is harmonious, shape-sensitive, but appearance has an attack of rigor.
You don't have to call the police.
On the CX-5, one of the most secure in the world, only Japanese tranquility can be experienced.
The diesel engine of 2.2 l provides a high torque at a wide range of speeds.
However, the fuel consumption of this engine with a capacity of 175 litres, a total of 5.9 litres, consists of a power unit consisting solely of automatic transmission and full transmission.
Black boots, black coat, black bag...
In order to add a little black humor to this image, you can select leggings with a bow from the Not Cross police tape.
However, Mazda has made every effort to ensure that you are not on the CX-5 drive in your own vehicle.
To further improve comfort, while maintaining excellent management, the suspensions restructured the front and rear amortizers and optimized the form of the front lever plugs.
The full transmission system has been adapted under Russian conditions.
The noise from the road and engine at high speeds is reduced by 13 per cent.
The flower bather or the bar is just as boring as the budget seat.
It's different if the girl's naked in the bathrobe with the original drawing.
From a computer game, for example, in the role-playing genre.
She'll get as much attention as the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has improved design for both front and rear seats, which provides optimal reserve of space and for wide shoulders, and for long legs, who has what they possess.
The long legs will surely appreciate that the thrusts in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not beat the ankles in the expression.
The largest set of Mazda active security systems is proposed at CX-5.
Radars, lasers, and cameras are used to identify potential threats.
There's adaptive lighting here, and a warning of getting off the lane, and monitoring of dead areas, and safe braking.
Mazda's CX-5 has one of the best trunks in the class.
Convenient, minimally speaking, it carries a load of 561 litres. Rear seats are in proportion to 4:4 - each section is fitted with a single stretcher - and increases the baggage compartment to 1560 litres.
Japan's cartoon hero costume is called "kigurums."
It's especially uncomfortable with the chigurums and the pyjamas.
There's everything in it!
Of course I'm asleep.
But it's fun to entertain little kids.
Or just walking around like that on the street...
After all, it's so great when you have the opportunity to choose -- the cool clothes, the behavioral manner, or the car.
Thank you for your help in preparing the Kawaicat material.
Kiev broke the nuclear ion.
Kiev formally rejected Ukraine's cooperation with Russia in the construction of the Chemelnitsko AEC.
On Wednesday, since the second attempt, the Supreme Council voted in favour of the termination of the agreement with Moscow.
Arrangements for the construction of the third and fourth blocs were signed in 2010-2012, but the project could not be initiated.
On Wednesday, the Supreme Council of Ukraine passed a law breaking the agreement concluded in 2010-2012 with the RF on the construction of the third and fourth bloc on the Chemelnicka AEC.
The draft law submitted by the Government was only implemented after the second vote, for the first time supported by 210 deputies, with the necessary minimum of 226, but was subsequently voted by 234 members of Parliament when the draft was re-voted.
The Kmelnitsk Nuclear Power Plant in the USSR for the initial project was expected to have four 1 HWGs with WWER reactors, but only two were able to build.
Negotiations with Moscow on construction led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement by 2010 and the Council adopted relevant laws in 2011-2012.
Since there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, it was anticipated that building blocks would have to be credited to the Russian side, but funds had never been allocated.
After the change in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in the relations between the two countries, Kiev began to derail relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, declaring its refusal to cooperate on the Chemical Nuclear Fuel Plant and on the project to build a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where relations persisted was the purchase of fuel in the Russian nuclear fuel for existing Ukrainian nuclear power plants (provided about half of the country ' s electricity generation), as so far as Ukrainian NAEC Energoate replaced Russian supplies.
The plans for the construction of Kmelnitzko AEC with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been definitively abandoned: in Kiev, in 2014, the Czech Skoda JS claimed to be negotiating with the Czech Skoda.
UN entity against the use of military force in resolving the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reported during the press conference that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.
“No military solution”, the AP replies to the question of Syrian military support from Russia.
Mr. Ki-moon also reported that he would meet with the Foreign Ministers of the Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will hold a meeting with the heads of the MID of the permanent members of the UNSC later this month.
"There will be a meeting in Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief General Staff of the Russian Federation Nikolay Bogdanovski reported that Genstab did not exclude the possibility of establishing a military base in Syria in the future.
That's not the plan yet.
"But anything can be," said Mr. Bogdanovsky.
Previously, "U" reported that the United States did not trust President Vladimir Putin of Russia, who claimed that military assistance from the official Damascus was necessary to combat the terrorist group 'Islam State' banned in the Russian Federation.
For more details on the US's doubts about Syria's Russian aid, see "U" in "Russian Military Presence in Syria" in Washington, D.C.
In the OSCE PA, the possible meeting of the parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia is reported.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine to the Parliamentary Assembly (PA) of OSCE, Arthur Gerassim, reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in the south-east of Ukraine.
“What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations,” said Mr. Gerasimov, TASS.
He also called for the implementation of mine agreements and “to return to the normal functioning of our countries”.
On the question of whether he believed that there was currently a dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level, in the “Normand format” or in the form of a contact group on the PA of OSCE, Mr. Gerassimov, noted that the dialogue had been held, and there were mine agreements.
At the same time, it is policy that any type of dialogue is supported in Kiev.
Formerly Ukraine's negotiating representative, Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-proclaimed Donetska and Lugana republics had so far not fundamentally changed their positions in the tripartite negotiations, but the tone of dialogue had become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the Lower Novgorod Electoral Commission conducted an election to the municipal district's urban Duma by distributing 12 parliamentary mandates on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of electoral violations have been made by the representatives of CRC, who have accused the parties of “falsifications”.
No comments were received from the opposition.
At the same time, the Communists of Russia refused to hold a referendum on the abolition of the caprendment fee for multi-house houses.
The city's selection officially presented the results of the elections in the proud Lower Novgorod for the municipal constituency.
The voting lists in Novgorod below included 1,03 million people, a ballot paper for the district commissions issued 746.7 thousand, and a vote of 268,000 voters.
More than 11.7 thousand ballots were declared invalid and 24 were lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were allocated to political parties, depending on their votes received.
According to the lists of "One Russia", six seats are proud of Dmitry Swatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnowu, Vasilia Shupranovu, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Vjeceslav Rasteriev and Igor Nagorny.
The only mandate of the LDPR was given by the leader of the party Vladimir Girinovski.
The two mandates of CRC are distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and the Parliamentary of the State party, Alexander Tarnaw.
The three mandates of "Just Russia" are given to Alexander Razumowski, Igor Bogdanov and Michael Shaluguin.
These candidates now have to determine within five days whether they will work as members of the city's Duma: if they refuse their mandate, they will move to the next Partisan candidate.
The Chairman of Horisbirskim, Alexander Maceev, informed the members of the Commission that he was introducing the tasks of “salvation to Girinovski and others” in order to renounce mandates.
When adopting the electoral report, the representatives of CRC declared numerous violations.
Mr. Leonid Krasnokutsky, a member of the Lesbyskom with the right to a deliberative vote from CRC, proposed not to recognize the outcome of the vote in the four districts No.21-24, recalling that, by order of the head of the administration of the Sormov district, the entrance to the administration building was closed, where the four district commissions were located.
In the long run, no members of the Goss udma, no candidates, no observers, and a resonant scandal with the storm of the doors of the administration was shown on television.
At the meetings of the District Commissions, all observers and members of the commissions with the right of deliberation were able to attend.
Their head ceased access only when the ballot had ended and the land commissions had not yet arrived to issue their ballot papers.
This has been done to prevent various provocations.
“Then the chapter was corrected and interested persons could be present at all meetings”, said a member of the mountains named Natalia Andrew.
The Communists objected that a member of the Ludmila Aristak district assembly had been illegally detained in the blocked administration building for more than four hours, and a statement had been sent to the investigative committee.
The opposition also resented the fact that in a number of UICs on election day, urns began to be sealed at 6-7 a.m. by issuing ballot papers for the early vote.
At the same time, the members of the commissions, with the right to a deliberative vote and observers, had not been notified, so they had already come to the start of the election at 8 a.m.
The Communists are confident that in the morning before the polling stations were opened, ballots could be thrown into the urns uncontrollably.
However, the mountains, which had already dealt with more than 124 complaints on various occasions, said Alexander Maceev, did not find any violations of the discards of unreported ballots.
The members of the Commission and the proposal of their colleague from Fair Russia, Maria Popova, were not supported by the Olysemberic amendment of the regional legislation, in order to make clear the time for the opening of envelopes with ballot papers which then fell into the field.
“In order of your own initiative, go to the CEC,” said Ms. Popovina Alexander Maceev.
At the end of the meeting, a member of the CRCC, Sergei Samohin, shouted that he ignored dozens of complaints and covered the election forgery.
"You're not here at the rally, be careful!" offended the President in the election.
The protocol was eventually approved almost unanimously.
By 27 September, the selector would have to approve the overall results of the elections, after which the first meeting of the lower Newgorod City Hall of the sixth meeting would be appointed within three weeks.
In addition to determining the outcome of the elections, the City Electoral Commission rejected the Russian Communist political party in the registration of an initiative group to hold a local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties were going to raise two questions for discussion by the low-urbans: whether they agreed that the renting fees for multi-house houses should be “rescinded immediately” and the housing and utilities charges “freeze up to 2020”.
However, Irina Maslav's lawyer explained that the treatment of the Communists of Russia was contrary to the law.
The FedEx benefit is mixed, the 2016 forecast decline.
FedEx reported the disappointing results of the last quarter, and the delivery giant reduced the annual return forecast due to the fall in demand for freight services and increased costs in its land transport sub-sector.
The company also stated that it planned to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
At the same time, the FedEx reported last year that it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for holidays.
Its shares rose by approximately 2.5 per cent in the preliminary bids 45 minutes before the opening of the stock exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that she planned to earn from $10.40 to $10.90 in the financial year ending next May, that 20 cents were lower than in the previous forecast.
Analysts assumed $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
The forecast has been reduced despite an average increase of 4.9 per cent, which will come into force on 4 January, and an increase in ground freight charges for heavy or gauge cargo, which begins in November.
The company stated that it was still planning to increase its profits over the past year by reducing costs, raising gross income and increasing online trade.
The Chairman and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company had “worked steadily against the weak, compared with the forecast, economic conditions, especially in production and world trade”.
Plans for the recruitment of workers on holidays were announced the day after a competitor's application, UPS, that they were planning to hire an additional 95,000 staff, approximately the same as they were hired last year.
Over the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 per cent more than the previous year.
Income for the share was $2.42, close to an average of $2.44 per share, conducted by Zacks Investment Research, surveyed by 12 analysts.
Income increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in the emergency international transport sector, leading to a lack of growth in gross income in its express transport subset.
However, the Internet buy boom has dramatically improved the FedEx Ground results.
In the last quarter, the proceeds from land transport increased by 29 per cent, but operating revenues remained generally unchanged owing to the increased costs of large shipments and self-insurance.
The express transport unit received higher income due to higher base rates, while the freight sector had lost income owing to higher labour costs.
At the pre-trades about an hour before the FedEx stock market opened, they fell by $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, dropping 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent below the 11 June record.
At the most expected meeting in a few years, the heads of the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table from the Honduras red tree, deciding whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost 10 years.
At one end, a decorated meeting room with two floors above the walls of the United States will be richly decorated.
This map is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve System, Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues, must put the economic interests of the country above all others.
The Central Bank has received a double mandate from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and to keep stable prices here.
But since the Great Recession, the heads of the Federal System have admitted that there are a third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
This third assignment may be an unknown factor in the almost predictable decision that will be announced on Thursday, whether the US economy is ready to break the unprecedented stimulus provided by the nearly zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data show positive growth in the economy, recent shocks in the world financial markets can keep already cautious Federal System leaders from adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds, even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lindsay M. Peegz, the leading economist in the brokering company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise a rate of uncertainty around the world market enough to give them an excuse to wait any longer," she remarked.
There is no consensus on what they will do in the Federal Reserve system, which in itself provokes fluctuations in the financial market.
Approximately half of the economists interviewed recently in Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal System to refrain from doing so, with the key indicator showing only about 30 per cent probability of a rapid recovery.
This may lead to a decline in the stock market if the Federal System raises the rate, provided that those who make decisions do not mitigate the impact of the promise that the next increase will be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow-Johns index rose to 228,89 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 16,599,85.
The takeoff was triggered by expectations that the policy makers of the Federal System would leave a stake this week, said John Lonski, the chief economist of the Moody's Capital Markets Research group.
"It will be a surprise if the Federal System increases the rate at this point of time," he noted.
If the management of the Federal Reserve system does so, “they will have to go far in approving their strategy to keep the financial markets in hand so that they do not panic”.
Other experts objected that the increase in the rate could calm the financial markets, since this would remove uncertainty about how the Federal System would operate.
Just a month ago, the Federal System seemed to be inclined to raise the rate by 0.25 per cent this month, making the first small checkpoint in the slow tightening of financial conditions, which could confirm the strength of US recovery.
Yellen stated in the spring and early summer that she expected an increase in the rate this year, despite complaints by the liberals that greater economic progress was needed.
Although new jobs slowed in August, labour market growth was stable this year.
Unemployment declined to 5.1 per cent last month, which is the lowest in more than seven years, and almost at the level considered full employment in the Federal System.
Wage growth shows signs of acceleration.
While inflation continues to fall below the central bank ' s 2 per cent annual rate, the Federal System management stated that the temporary impact of the sharp fall in oil prices was a key factor.
The economy “can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the decline in the labour market”, observed Ian Schaeardson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China had devalued its currency.
The Mid-Doe-Jones Industrial Companies Share Index dropped 16 per cent relatively high in May, as investors feared that China's slowing economy could slow down world growth.
The market has partly recovered its position this month, and the Dow-John index is now about 10 per cent lower than the Mayan value.
For the management of the Federal Standby System, market resentment further complicates the difficult calculation of the increase in interest rate.
“In the absence of information on what has happened in the financial markets and on the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would have been throwing hooks at this meeting”, said Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA Senior Researcher Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Federal Reserve Officer.
He now expects them to wait at least a month to get more control of the consequences.
“There is a great deal of uncertainty as to what might be the impact on the American economy, and they have almost no reliable data since the recent events in China”, said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not a primary concern of the Federal System and should not be technically taken into account when making these decisions.
But in fact, the Federal Reserve has become the global financial authority.
The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
Only a hint from then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve system could “suffer” its monetary expansion has caused shock to markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, it could be expected that the leaders of the Federal Reserve system would not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other Central Banks and experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process, “early art than science”, said Zakari Karabel, head of Envestnet Inc, a company that operates global state management strategies.
Geoffrey Laker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that “in the history of the Federal Reserve, there have been excessive reactions to financial market movements that seem to be unrelated to economic principles”.
Lacker, a member with the right to vote of the influential Federal Open Market Committee, insisting on an increase in the rate, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian financial crisis has led the Federal System to lower its base rate by 0.75 per cent for three meetings, “in spite of the limited identified effects on growth in the United States”, said Laker.
A year later, the heads of the Federal System lifted those cuts.
The Federal Reserve System should be placed at the top of its concern for stability only in times of major crises, such as market failure in 2008,” said Adam S. Pozen, former member of the interest-rate committee at Bank of England.
The latter panic and did not get close to that level, he said.
"You would certainly not want to be in a situation where you are afraid of rising rates because of the shock of markets," said Pozen, President of the Peterson World Economy Institute.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I do not think that they should be ahead of events.

Although there may be a lot of people in the store, parking is usually easy to find.
Speaker of Gosduma Sergey Narishkin allows the United States to deliberately destabilize the situation in the Middle East in order for the waves of refugees to flow to Europe.
As Interfax conveyed, he expressed that view to journalists in Ulaanbaatar during the fall session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
“I am not a supporter of conspiracy theories, but the question is itself asked: is it not Europe that is the ultimate goal of those who have destabilized the situation in North Africa and the Middle East with such manic insistence in recent years?” he asked.
“There must have been someone who suspected and knew that the flows of refugees, these unfortunate and destitute people, who are saved from death, are striving for the well-being of the EU countries”, he added.
Narishkin asked: “Did many political leaders of Europe speak frankly about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees, which now literally ensnares their countries?”
"No, the old Europe, except rarely, prefers to remain silent," he observed.
According to Narishkin, NATO is in violation of many of the European values and norms of international law.
"Europe, unfortunately, has long looked and looked impartially at the way in which the military sapogue, sewn according to NATO standards, has also melted the moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law," the speaker emphasized.
Government forces and loyal militias are opposed by rebels, mostly of Islamists.
Later, a terrorist group, “Islamic State”, banned in Russia, joined the opponents of the Syrian Government.
The United States supports both Assad and IG insurgents.
Official Damascus considers these rebels terrorists.
The President of Syria called the cause of the West's hostility to Russia.
Western claims to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are indeed sovereign States.
That was the view expressed by Syrian President Bashar Assad in an interview with RT, Channel I, Russia 24, NTV, Russia today, TASS, Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
According to Assad, the West does not understand partners and sovereign States.
In those countries, he wished to remove one person and place another who would act for the benefit of Western countries rather than for the benefit of his family, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the sharp turn of Western media with the start of a coup in Ukraine.
He said that for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin “turned from the other West to the enemy, the king, the dictator who overthrew the Russian opposition, which came to power undemocraticly, despite being elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West”.
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad to fight the Islamic State.
Commenting on the Permanent Statements of the West that Assad must leave, he noted that the President had come to power with the consent of the people, through the elections, and that, if he left, at the request of the people, and not at the request of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communiqué.
“If the people want him to stay, the President stays, or else they should leave immediately”, he emphasized.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and reminded them that cooperation was under way.
Syria is also fighting terrorism in conjunction with neighbouring Iraq.
With regard to Iran ' s military support, the Syrian leader noted that the country supported the Syrian State in politics, the economy and the military sphere.
He refuted the claim that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran is supplying us with military equipment.
“Of course, there has been an exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out”, he explained.
With regard to the remaining States, we are open to cooperation with any of them, with a strong desire to combat terrorism.
“We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-gil coalition known to the United States”, Assad said.
The number of deaths exceeded 230,000 and the number of refugees was 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was seized by the Islamic State terrorist group banned in Russia.
The international coalition, headed by the United States, is striking air strikes at IG positions.

Borody called the American newspaper a slander of Strelkov.
Former President of the Government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Boroday, the information published in The Washington Post of America.
He interviewed Lenty.ru on the phone.
The Washington Post note is beautiful because it's completely overworked.
The former DNR Minister of Defence, Igorija Strelkova, of course, did not link and “come out” from Donbass republics in a very mood, without ropes, without three coaches of money attributed to him by various characters”, he noted.
According to Boroday, it was really about Strelkov in conversation with the reporter of the American newspaper.
“Yes, I said that Strelkova urgently needed to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic”, said the former head of the DNR Government.
Boroday stressed that he did not know why the reporter of the American publication decided to write that Strelkov had been taken to Russian territory "bound".
I suspect it's provocation.
If it's not provocation, it's surprisingly misinterpreted, because I emphasized that Strelkov was leaving on his own," said Borrodai.
"It's slander to me and to Strelkov," he concluded.
Previously, The Washington Post published an article that quoted Boroday as saying that he had exported Strelkov to Russia by force.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he had to contact his companion.
The Polish authorities have begun searching for a train of gold Nazis.
Polish logging has begun to cut down trees above the underground tunnel, where some have reportedly found a train with the gold of the Third Reich.
Work began on Tuesday, 15 September, Reuters reported.
According to military experts, clearing the forest is necessary in order to verify the reliability of rumors of the railway structure with treasures.
Weapons and valuable minerals can be found inside the trains.
On 31 August, Polish Governor Tomas Smolarz (Tomasz Smolarz) assumed that the new proof of the existence of a gold train was not more convincing than the previous one.
However, the authorities decided to detach the search area.
Three days earlier, the Deputy Minister of Culture, Poland, Petr Zukowski, stated that local grave dignitaries “probability 99 per cent” had found the same train with the Third Reich gold described in the legends.
Zhukowski noted that if the assumptions were confirmed and the gems were found, they would become property of the state's execution, and the treasures would not be passed on to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of a legal firm reported to the authorities of the Polish town of Valbzhyh that they had found a train in a frozen tunnel 70 metres deep.
The principal drug addict of the Russian Federation has proposed to prohibit the sale of tobacco to individuals up to the age of 21.
Russia's chief drug dealer has proposed to ban tobacco sales up to the age of 21.
Evgeny Brun noted that until this age “any psychoactive substance — tobacco, alcohol, drugs — is particularly harmful”.
So he said in the live air of Govorit Moscow radio, commenting on the fact that Speaker Sowfed Valentina Matvienko supported the idea of prohibiting the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21 years of age.
Man matures unevenly.
You can serve in the army from 18 years of age, and you're physically willing to do that.
He's been mentally prepared for a full life in society since 21.
“It is known from scientific evidence that his brain, his biochemistry, is fully mature only by the age of 21,” Brown noted.
Formerly a member of the Public Chamber and head of the “Tresja Russia” project, Sultan Hamzaev reported to the News that Matvienko supported the initiative to raise the age price in the sale of alcohol and “agreed with the Public Chamber to raise the issue again at the centre of the upper House of Parliament”.
According to the activist, the Federation Council will soon establish a working group to draft a bill under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible was asked to verify compliance with the Children’s Information Protection Act
The resident of Novosibirsk requested the Regional Prosecutor's Office to examine the Bible to the extent that the Federal Law on the Protection of Children from Information Harming Their Health and Development was read by correspondent Sib.fm on 16 September.
The author stated that on 26 August 2015 he acquired a Bible from the Russian Bible Society at the Chithai City Shop on the Red Prospect.
In the text of the book, he found fragments which, in his view, violated the FZ “Protection of children against information that harmed their health and development”.
On 16 September, a statement was adopted for consideration by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of Novosibirsk City.
The citizens of Novosibirsk will receive an answer within 30 days.
It's not the point of banning the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, said the complainant to correspondent Sib.fm.
In addition, it is a very fundamental problem that society will face.
It will begin to reread what the Bible has not done before.
Brazilian Pediatrics Union of Rio Grandi promotes healthy nutrition for breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has developed a scandalous method to convince women to eat fully during breastfeeding: the method implies showing images of breast-based infants with harmful foods.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Due to the high energy needs of pregnant and fertile women, it is recommended that the daily standard of calories be increased by about 500 calories per day.
However, recent research has shown that one increase in calories is not the only change in diet that mothers should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor Medical College in Texas, found that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the expression of genes in children and prevents them from developing tumors.
Regrettably, the adverse effects of malnutrition on the immune system of the child have been identified.
Under Hamburg, the train ran a school bus.
A train crashed into a school bus near Hamburg, which was stuck on a railway road.
A 23-year-old driver, realizing that she could not move away from the track, ordered 60 pupils to leave the vehicle.
And a minute after that, they had a collision in their eyes.
He was filmed by one of the schoolboys.
There was panic among students due to an emergency.
Some children began to cry and run along their shoulders.
The march is still blocked.
According to the police, no one was miraculously injured except one passenger of a train who suffered minor injuries.
The damage to the accident was estimated at 300,000 euros.
Doctors call for boxing.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) directed that boxing be prohibited in the country after the death of a local athlete, David Brown, Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died from injuries sustained in association with Filipino Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles of the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg, which took place on Friday, ended with Magala knockout in the 12th round.
Brown went to the hospital with a head trauma.
Its condition was assessed as critical, and it was connected to the life support apparatus.
In the trade ring, Brown won 22 victories, suffered only two defeats, and one battle ended at night.
He's got two kids left.
It's already the second case of flying out of Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, a 23-year-old student, Bradon Smith, died of injuries sustained in the ring.
Now AMA recommends not to engage in this type of sport, but rather to ban it in its general view.
I understand that this is going on unintentionally, said the vice president of the Steven Pernis organization.
But in the form of boxing, there will always be situations in which an athlete gets hemorrhaging or brain trauma, which leads to either death or serious injury.
For that reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that unites practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Narishkin called on the OSCE PA to abolish sanctions against RF parliamentarians.
Speaker Gosduma RF Sergey Narishkin called it intolerable sanctions against parliamentarians.
He said so by addressing the OSCE PA session in Ulaanbaatar.
We regard this as unacceptable acts as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
“This must not be repeated because it is a manifestation of political shame and a disregard for the principles of open international dialogue”, said the politician.
In addition, Narishkin called on the OSCE PA to re-establish the Russian and EU partnerships.
Let's put morality back in politics.
Let us restore dialogue and law to the practice of international communication.
Let us restore the humanistic ideals to the democratic order.
"Two people have never ended well," he said.
Speaking from the Parliamentary Assembly rostrum, the Speaker of the Russian Parliament called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamental contact group on Ukraine.
I call on the Assembly to focus on the following specific security challenges.
“First, to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group”, Narishkin said.
He also noted the need to pay tribute to the OSCE.
“It is almost the only common square where we are still discussing how to normalise the situation in Ukraine”, stressed the politician.
The session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened in Ulaanbaatar on Tuesday, 15 September and will continue until 18 September.
Enjoying your victory for a couple of days.
Champion of the World in the Light Athletics, Sergei Shubenkov.
This season is called a 24-year-old lightweight from Barnaul Sergey Shubenkova.
He was able to win a few records at his crowning distance of 110 metres with barriers to Europe's command, and the main thing was to become the champion of the world, the first in the history of the national barrier.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final phase of the Brillian League by taking third place in general.
"New News" asked Shubenkova to share the impressions of the off-season season.
Sergei, the season is not over for you?
Yes, I'm going to speak at the World Military Games, which will be held in Korea in October, and then I'll think about rest.
True, preparing now will be home, in Barnaul, and being home is still a completely different condition.
It's easier than going around the world every week.
You once said autumn is your favorite time of year.
In late August, the beginning of September is a wonderful time.
Passion after the main start of the season has been denied, the burden of responsibility no longer prevails.
You can have fun on relaxing.
Plus, you know, vacation's pretty soon...
Do you have fatigue?
It's a special season, though, a lot of positive emotions...
Tiredness always builds up by the end of the season.
And it doesn't matter what he did more, win or lose.
Every competition is stress.
Constant flights, crossings -- all of this doesn't go on without a trace.
You're standing up physically and emotionally.
But now I have emotions, of course, on the rise.
I'm just happy!
By the time they finished the World Cup in Beijing, do you come back often?
It happens.
And you journalists won't let me forget that.
But in general, I think that the bad sportsman who lives through old victories is screwing up his successful runs over and over again.
Enjoying winning for a couple of days, and we have to move on.
The preparation for this remarkable season was very different from the usual season?
I can't say there was anything so special.
We started getting ready in December, but I missed the winter competition season.
He used to train at home in Barnaul, then in the congregation, then back home.
Everything's normal.
But with the coach, they set the challenge: to try to get to a new level I've never been to before.
Almost all the winter time was spent laying the groundwork.
They ran a bunch of crosses, did general physical training exercises that included both the pull and the landing, and we rolled our backs.
Then they took up barrier training, and they did a lot of tech.
How did the rivals act?
I'm always trying to do that, and there's no problem with the best in the Internet era.
I looked at Europe's winter champion, and the French took the whole pedestal in a barrier sprint!
I thought I'd do something to keep this company apart.
With every start this season you added and added to the results.
Did that give you confidence?
I've got all the last seasons on about the same pattern.
It's not like I'm running first 13.20 and then 13.50.
I'm always twisting my form gradually.
The main thing that I wanted to do was run out of 13 seconds.
All the work was focused primarily on this result.
But the paradox is that you feel like you're ready for a feat, and you don't always get to show off at the competition.
How was it, for example, at the London Olympics?
I, to be honest, that semifinal run (Shubenkov was unable to get to the finals. - "N" tried to forget right away.
I mean, it was really good. I mean, it could've really run out of 13 seconds.
Even if I were to repeat my best result at that point, I'd be a bronze prize game.
But it wasn't luck.
Do you remember your first world champion?
What about it?
It was in Tegu.
I really wanted to go to the finals, I was such a top-up program.
And he's gone straight from tomorrow to early runs.
That's when I realized that breaking and carrying a broken head would mean never running anywhere.
Two years later, at the World Cup in Moscow, he was in the finals with the best of time.
I remember my feelings before a decisive run: I really wanted to win the gold back then!
How do you do that while you're developing a good speed, not losing your head, not unlocking?
That's the hardest part.
You need to be very careful, focused on the technique, so you don't break the barriers.
He noticed that when you're not going for the result, it's easier for the process.
It's high when you feel like you're running away and everything works out!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the deep end of their first major successes are trying to move closer to the capital.
Never had such thoughts?
Home is still better.
I have no idea where I am without my coach, who needs me?
It may be good to have a better environment, but I try to be happy with what I have.
Have you and Cleves been together for a long time?
Since he was 12 years old, he's come to light athletics.
In fact, first I trained with his wife, who worked with the children, and then she handed me over.
I started with a sprint, then a triple jump.
It was a child's struggle. It's when they throw the ball, jump into the length of the place.
At 14, he tried to run off with the barriers, and I liked it.
Since the first run, the second adult level has been met.
That's what's left.
There's never been fear of barriers?
I was able to make a deal with them.
But technology has always had to work very hard.
He's over one race how much he's been tormented!
But there's nowhere to turn from this routine.
The technique has to be pulled out all the time - so I can wake up at night, and I'll get up and run through the barriers.
Everyone who saw you run into Beijing claims it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I don't usually go over my runs, and I couldn't stay here.
But efficiency needs to be continued - there are no limits to perfection.
Aren't you afraid that a year before the Olympics, victory will be a heavy burden on your shoulders?
As they say, I will try to meet expectations.
Once you've chosen this road, you have to go to the end.
My coach likes to repeat, if you're not weak, there's no extra load to feel.
And I totally agree with him.
Otar Kushanashville
Well, I'm not so naive as to be an amazing reaction to the interview that took place in Ukraine.
The people are stoned, I understand their bread is not feed. Come on, come on, let's get the enemy.
And although I haven't been around the flag, and that's exactly what I've been talking about a million times here, and I haven't called anyone a bastard directly, it's done me anything else.
All my pseudo-friends are out in a second.
The press that I'm being subjected to is so strong that even I, who's seen the kind of boyfriends, I think people are whited out.
Like he was walking, walking, and a crowd attacked you, muting in chains.
But you have to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'm a loofah, I'm an old man, I'm afraid.
The other thing is no support.
I didn't have any illusions, and now...
I've always had the best self-sufficiency, so you'll have a taste.
And giving passports to people like Fred Derst or Monson can only be fools.
I'd rather, the best journalist, work shameless.
A week ago, in Kyiv, Otar Kushanashvili, in sharp form, described the events of the Crimea:
What they did to the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
That's what they call annexation.
I so believe that the reference to how the drunk Khrushchev tried to sign something doesn't fit into the general picture of a human dormitory.
It's like coming to the neighbor's house and taking his apartment...
The Kremlin war is gone, and it's only going to end there.
I'm almost 100% sure that, like in the summer of 2008, she started calling some bastard from Kremlin's cap.
I have any idea who that might be...
Cobson's not that big a deal, and there's a lot of life left.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Putin's hands.
Is he gonna lose his apartment?
Well, they took his monument.
Of course, people remembered him as insulting to their small family.
And only Vladimir Vladimirovich's reconciliation now depends.
Sunrise's seventh rank goes down despite the Niners' attempts to light up the loser leaders at Today's Show.
The landing of Carl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson in Canberra to highlight the impact of the Liberal Party's declaration on the liberation of the leader's seat has not been able to raise today's ratings significantly.
The morning show of the Ninth was broadcast from the capital of the State after the bombing of Malcolm Turnbull Tony Ebbot.
Competitor Sunrise, with lead David Koh and Samantha Armitage, has become stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international news, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancún.
This torture seemed to have been of little importance to Australian televisionians, with Sunrise audiences of 397,000 in the five largest cities, compared with today's audience of 339,000.
Today, it gained slightly more than its rating on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but it was worse than last Thursday (343 000).
Today has narrowed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000 compared to Sunrise’s 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap varied between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, in September, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers versus 314,000 in Today.
It's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are more influential than Parliament this morning, boys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thanks for clarifying.
Published by TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015.
An important news story for Seventh was the amazing debut of 800 Words with the former star of Packed to the Rafters by Erik Thompson.
A new drama about the recently widowed father of the family, who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with their two children, has gathered an impressive audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics were wondering if Thompson could handle a popular show alone without Rafters Rebecca Gibney's star.
The result of last night's dinner is a loud answer yes.
The X Factor of the Seventh stayed in strong positions with an audience of 1,136 million spectators, easily bypassing The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000).
For the seventh, there was a mix of luck and failure on the second night of Chase Australia.
The first half hour (from 5:00 to 17:30) of the new television station, led by Andrew O'Kifi, brought together 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) the number jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of Chase Australia gathered 520,000 spectators, and the second half hour was a total of 720,000.
Hot Seat collected 620,000.
The fall of Chase Australia's ratings on the second night will make the Ninth quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5:30.
Chase Australia is the replacement of the Million Dollar Minute, who couldn't beat the McGuire show.
Initially, it was published as "Sunrise is leading, while Today remains at the local level."
Three finalists agree that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jevon-Pellowes, Sarah McKay and Snezhan Marcoschi, possibly by accident, gave an idea which one of them would win at the Holostiake.
The woman with whom Sam Wood will eventually remain in the Holocaust is surrounded by a secret curtain.
And the three girls who made it to the finals, of course, keep quiet about which one of them got his last roses.
But when we met with Sarah McKay, Snowy Marcos and Lana Gewons-Fellows the day that the three girls would have to stay two, they might have accidentally given a hint about the winner.
Sam Wood keeps quiet until the final on Thursday
All three women come into a lyrical mood, explaining why Wood is the perfect man, while mentioning his sense of humor, his determination, his family values, his joys as the reason why each of them would be happy to be his companion.
But with their answers to the question, "If not for you, who should get the last rose of Wood?" they could not have told who really won the heart of the Holocaust.
Jewons-Pellows and Marcoschi were certainly named McKay as the perfect couple for Wood.
Sarah and Sam had a good relationship from day one.
"From the moment I joined the audience, I felt the energy (Sary) and the energy of Sam, and I realized that they were very approachable to each other, and throughout the show, I had no doubt about it," said Jeeves-Pelloughs.
"Sara's a very open man with her easy and fun," said Marcoskie.
I saw them together, and there's really an attraction between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she'll make a great couple, and Sam Wood.
McKay herself said that thanks to her home dates last week, she realized that Wood might be the "most human."
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized it wasn't just a game; I believed him with all my heart," she said.
To whom Voodoo should be chosen, if it is not for her, she answered mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls the same way, and Snowman and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor show goes on Wednesday at 7:30 on Ten.
Initially published as "Sara is Sam Wood's Best Choice?"
Jarrid Hein had several options for starting a career at the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in him after he moved to the United States, as were many other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsul, and it seems like it was a wise decision.
Some coaches would leave Hayn at the dock for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball, which the former Australian League football player regby allowed at the first return of the Panta in the winning game with Minnesota with a 20-3 score.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hain another chance to return his pant, and he also played it after Reggie Bush's trauma.
Tomsula showed up on the good side and after the game, in the dressing room.
Instead of giving the recruits away in the presence of a team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Heine at a press conference after the match.
The 49ers's Special Reporter Cam Inman reported that Hein had also received support from Thomas McGoy's Special Team Coordinator, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and to think about the next game.
Jarrid Hein lost his ball in return to his pants by Minnesota Wakings team during the first quarter.
To that end, the debut in NHL Hain and its many Australian worshipers were evidently not counted.
It was seen as Hein scurrying out of the field after losing the ball, and later he told the lead show Hamish and Andy at 2DayFM 104.1 Australia Radio, which he could not imagine as a failed start for a career in NFL.
"That's what happens, you just think about the next game and everything," said Hain.
Heine compared his failure with his debut in the Origin series in 2007, when the ball pitch in his start-up zone brought an attempt on Queensland.
In the end, this experience has proved very useful for a 27-year-old player.
Hein took a picture with the Australian flag and fans after the game and took a picture in Instagram.
Elton John and President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkowski, the richest person in Russia, was arrested under threat of use at Siberian airport.
The openly challenging President Vladimir Putinu, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his attempts to promote democracy were cut off.
Migrants clashed with the police at the border of Hungary.
The refugees protested on the border of Serbia near the Hungarian Reske settlement, which turned into clashes with law enforcement.
As a result, the Hungarian police applied watermarks and tear gas, transmitting Reuters.
Migrants throw police stones at the border and try to tear down the fence.
Support has been directed to the site of the clashes, and police have taken steps to respond to the aggressive actions of migrants and their attempts to break the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, refugees managed to break through the police border, after which dozens of migrants fled to Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Serbian-Hungary border on buses heading for Belgrade and the border with Croatia, says "Bi-bi-si".
The authorities allowed migrants to enter Croatian territory and to transport them from there to the country they needed.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian Parliament strengthened legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments include the participation of the army in the protection of public borders, the prosecution of those who cross the border illegally, and an accelerated procedure for the processing of asylum requests.
The Hungarian Court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border and will therefore be deported and unable to return to Hungary within one year.
The Hungarian Parliament also intends to consider the transfer of border protection functions to the Hungarian armed forces in the country's parliament in the near future.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began building a fence with a barbed wire of 175 kilometres on the border with Serbia to contain the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
The Russians admitted to having committed the largest cyberattack in the history of the United States.
Russian cyberattack Vladimir Drinkman, who is accused of stealing over 160 million credit cards, reports Reuters.
During the proceedings before the Federal Court of New Jersey, Drinkman confessed to conspiracy to obtain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian spoke of collusion with three citizens of Russia and a citizen of Ukraine accused of cyberattacks by 15 companies.
Total damage from the actions of the accused was estimated at $300 million.
“Responents like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack into our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security”, said US prosecutor Paul Fishman.
Drinkman is facing a 30-year sentence and a million-dollar fine.
In sentencing, the court will take into account the confession of a Russian citizen and may reduce the time limit.
Drinkman's verdict is issued on 15 January.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
Then another suspect, Dmitry Smilian, was taken into custody.
The latter denies his guilt for the crimes he commits.
Kerry warned Lavrov of a risk supported by Russia’s Bashar Assad regime.
During a telephone conversation with Russian MID head Sergei Lavrov US Secretary John Kerry warned that Russia's support for Syrian President Bashar Assad exacerbated the conflict in the country.
“Secretary Kerry made it clear that Russia’s support for President Assad risks aggravating and widening the conflict and undermining our common goal of combating extremism if we did not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power”, says a communication published on the US State Department website.
Kerry reiterated the commitment of the United States to combat the Islamic State (which is prohibited in Russia by the Supreme Court) coalition of more than 60 States.
According to the Secretary of State, Assad “can never be a reliable member” of the coalition.
Also during the phone call, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria could only be resolved through a political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened with isolation because of the support of the Assad regime.
On the eve of the White House Spokesman Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation unless it stopped supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed to join the international coalition, which is conducting an anti-terrorism operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media have often reported the presence of Russian troops in Syria.
At what point the head of Russian MID, Sergei Lavrov, has claimed that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and have helped Syrians to master the technique to use it against Islamists.
Four were killed when police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four persons, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police fired rubber bullets at a crowd protesting against the proposed new Constitution, as an official said on Wednesday.
Violence took place in Rupandei district on Tuesday evening, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, head of district police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters gathered at a police station, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that the police used tear gas, then fired into the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, he said.
It is not surprising why rubber bullets, which are known to be fatal but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such high mortality.
This clash was the last few weeks of violent protests in southern Nepal, the equal part of Nepal, where the Madesian people claim that the new provinces formed under the new constitution will reduce their political influence.
Protesters also took place in the west of Nepal, among the Taru citizens who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, were killed in violent clashes, starting with 10
On August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into the province, a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for several centuries.
The new constitution has been under way since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that claimed thousands of lives in April.
Lawmakers voted in favour of the articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said that the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk is planning to set up an enterprise for 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 1970s as a center of the chemical industry, with an advanced infrastructure requiring system support.
A year ago, Sayansk headed the new mayor, Oleg Borovsky.
On the results of the first year of work, on new projects and prospects, he told the correspondent of the District.
Oleg Valerievitch, where did you start working as mayor?
First of all, I learned about the results of financial and economic audits and initiated an independent audit of local budget expenditure.
A municipal property audit was then carried out.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce document turnover to five days.
In the past, paper on the authorities may have walked for months.
Income-based activities and cost optimization have been developed.
Last November, a Government retreat was held in Sayansk to address the economic and social development of the Territory.
There were no design and cost documents (PPAs) in the city at any facility.
Without that, Sayansk could not participate in federal programmes.
We started preparing PDS for roads, kindergarten, north sewer and water supply.
Road works at two stations are now under way.
How is the RF president's decree on the construction of kindergartens being implemented in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Saińsk.
Such a positive demographic has not been observed in the city for the past 27 years.
So the question of ensuring the place in kindergarten is one of the most relevant for today.
Since 1 September, it has been closed to the major repair of kindergarten No. 10, with a capacity of 320 seats.
The estimated cost of repairs is 86 million roubles.
The city has never received such funds before.
Last year, after the renovation, a kindergarten No. 23 was opened, which is now attended by 200 children.
Renovation was made under the conditions of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, with a value of more than 67 million roubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the regional Government, funds were sought for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and the National Initiatives programme was also supported.
There are plans to start building a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the rank of children between the ages of one and a half and three years.
We don't have anything for children from three to seven years.
Investors show interest in the Territory?
We have a clear understanding that the construction of the city must be done primarily by the Saian enterprises, and that they must be provided with work.
As early as October, a 60-bedroom house for orphans in Leningradsky's micro-region is being put into operation.
With regard to construction, I would add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangara, which was part of the economic-class housing programme.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 blocks will begin shortly.
We have declared a total of 10,000 square metres of housing for those wishing to participate in the programme very much.
One condition is that housing should not be more than 30,000 rubles per square metre, which includes the subkey division.
If we manage the assigned amounts, we will continue to participate in the programme.
As far as investors are concerned, we have other interesting projects.
At that time, the territory was built by a Zionn swine complex, which was sold at a price in 2004.
We are working with the Public Prosecutor's Office to protest this transaction.
Even more so, the ground under the object is federal property.
Work is underway with Moscow, the transfer of 88 ha to district property, with the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor willing to invest 1.5 billion rubles in the reconstruction and launch of the project.
With a bunch of pigs, we're going to have 900 jobs, which is going to be a big help to the city.
A social partnership institution is being developed in Sayansk?
We have some 140 contracts of socio-economic partnership.
Many projects have been implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Significant support is provided by enterprises such as WAO East-Centre, New-Ziminska TEC, Siayan Broiler, MDF PSO, the management of these enterprises responds to all appeals.
Directly to the Day of the city of the Soyane Broiler, children's towns were given to the city, and East Centr was repaired by the horse palace, where professionals deal with children with impateria, costing more than 1 million rubles.
Thanks to the sponsors, it has been possible to upgrade the territory of the city of ZGAS.
Sponsors helped to celebrate the city’s day beautifully.
As in the good old days, a parade was held with the participation of city teams and organizations.
A pilot of the city, a book of Saian poets, was released.
The leaders and people who have made a serious contribution to the development of Siyańska have been given the medals.
The Mecenates are also involved in the work of the City Charities Fund.
The first step was to acquire tools for young talented musicians.
In nine months, over 800,000 rubles have been directed to support talented children, to help children in need of expensive treatment, to support children from poor families.
How are human resources problems addressed in Sayansk in the social sphere?
The city lacks doctors and educators.
The provision of accommodation is essential to address the human resources issue.
Over the past year, we have allocated five doctor’s apartments, and four teachers have obtained office accommodations.
We have a housing programme to privatize it in five years' time.
The plans are to redesign the building, which will build eight more teachers' apartments.
Teachers and doctors are also involved in the programme of housing for the Russian family.
In the future, building a home for budget workers.
Most importantly, there is a working team in town with which I can address the most difficult issues.
It is important for all crises to make the right conclusions, and life will not stop.
It's a potential in Saiyansky and our region.
A bill on the indexation of the socio-pension, taking into account price increases, has been introduced in Doumu.
A bill has been introduced in Gosdum to index social pensions annually as from 1 February, taking into account price increases.
The author of the paper - MP from Fair Russia, Alexander Lomakin-Romiantsev - also proposes to carry out additional pension indexation on 1 April if the rate of growth of the minimum subsistence allowance exceeds the rate of increase in the prices of goods and services.
The indexation of the pensions under the current legislation has been made annually since 1 April, taking into account the growth in the subsistence minimum of the pensioner in the FP over the past year.
The draft law introduced in the lower chamber provides for the introduction of an indexation of social pensions, taking into account the rate of growth in consumer prices.
The first indexation was carried out on 1 February and the second was held on 1 April.
The Head of the OSCE has declared Mogherini inadmissible for sanctions against parliamentarians.
In a formal letter to the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Federique Mogherini, Speaker of the OSCE PA, Ilkka Kanerva, stated that sanctions against legislators participating in the assembly activities were not allowed.
This was reported to journalists by a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar Nikolai Kowalev.
In support of Kanerva's position, TSA reports the signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, have been collected.
"Although strong support has been formed," said Kowalev.
He had previously stated that the OSCE Head of the PA had expressed his intention to gather signatures of deputies who had indicated that sanctions against parliamentarians could not be imposed.
In particular, Kovalev noted, Kanerva pledged to raise the problem to the level of the leadership structures of the European Union and “sent the petition in question”.
NHC reports that the probability of cyclone south of the Green Mouse is 60 per cent
The broad front of the low pressure area is approximately 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Green Cape Islands, with a probability of 60 per cent turning into a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, the National Center of Hurricanes of the United States reported on Tuesday.
Another well-defined area of low pressure, approximately midway between the islands of Green Mouse and the Small Antilles, is also 60 per cent likely to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, reports the Miami synoptics.
Google launches a double donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the launch of a double-donations campaign aimed at collecting $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping European countries refugees fleeing war-torn countries.
Google used a non-character personal approach to launching a donation campaign in its blog.
Instead of making a statement, Google associate Rita Masoud, who had fled from Kabul when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We traveled on suspicious trains and buses, suffered hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has intensified, many such people as my family desperately need help.
Donations will be made to four non-profit organizations dealing with refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would double the first $5.5 million until the amount on Google.com/refugeerelief reached $11 million.
Europe has resisted the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, caused by most of the four-year civil war in Syria, which has left over 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing the wars of Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Abdominal surgery may help diabetics with low obesity
The beneficial effect of obesity surgery in type 2 diabetic subjects may last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to claim that diabetics with little obesity live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"The statistics of mortality are not immediately apparent," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity surgery, who wrote about a new study in the column of the JAMA Surgery editor.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses various methods to reduce stomach size.
They reduce the sense of hunger and limit the ability of the body to absorb food.
Over the years bariatric surgery has proved effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but major studies have been conducted among people with morphic obesity with body mass index (IMT) 35 or higher.
IMT, weight measure relative to growth, is considered to be normal for between 18.5 and 24.9.
IMT 25 or above indicates that a person has excess weight, and people with IMT above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers from Taiwan City Hospital Min-Sheng General used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery: gastric and glaucoma bypassing, with type 2 diabetes in people with low obesity.
The average IMT value for those undergoing surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, IMT remains approximately 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36 per cent were completely cured of diabetes and 28 per cent were partially treated.
In the treatment group, for comparison, only 1% had a complete diabetes treatment and only about 2% had a partial treatment.
In addition, the blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LPNP cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group”, the authors state.
Researchers also controlled the levels of hemoglobin A1s in blood, which reflect blood sugar levels in the blood in dynamics.
A1c hemoglobin should be kept below 7%, according to researchers.
Following surgery, the mean haemoglobin of A1c decreased from approximately 9 per cent to approximately 6 per cent.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable at approximately 8 per cent.
However, the best glycaemic control rates, reflected by the good levels of A1c hemoglobin, did not reduce the mortality rate in five years, according to the research manager, Dr. Chi Cheng Soo and colleagues.
The study group also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
By the fifth year, more weight was lost (18.7 kg vs 14.2 kg) compared to the arm’s gastro-gear group ( 7.4 vs 5.1) and hemoglobin A1s (3.1 per cent versus 2.1 per cent), and it was closer to the complete remission of diabetes (47.9 per cent versus 16.7 per cent).
Although the new study did not demonstrate the benefits of a surgical method in terms of life expectancy after five years, there was evidence from a study of people with excess body mass in Sweden that surgical treatment actually led to an increase in life expectancy, according to Blackstone of the College of Medicine in Phoenix, University of Arizona.
According to a Swedish study for obese people who chose bariatric intervention, the probability of dying for 15 years was approximately 29 per cent lower than that of a group with more traditional methods.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this encouraged people with IMT below 35 interested in such a procedure.
“The report here is very important because it claims that this surgical intervention is safe in a low-IMT group where there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease”, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking their weight seriously as soon as the patient reaches the range between 27 and 30.
"I think we've waited too long to make people take this seriously," she said.
It seems to me that once they accumulate the genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to reverse it.
In the Myths, the robbers took the coats and 9 million rubles out of the house.
In Mystiští, the robbers attacked the people of the house and stole 9 million roubles and three women's coats.
This is reported by Interfax with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
The incident took place on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown people entered a house on the street of Gorski, tied up a 20-year-old homeowner's son, and grabbed 9 million rubles and three coats, threatening both knives.
According to preliminary data, the damage amounted to 9 million 265,000 rubles, a criminal case under “Rupture” has been initiated.
Fans from Europe risk becoming homeless.
Only 23 Peterburg hotels have the right to host tourists who will come to see the World Cup championship in 2018.
The rest of the hotel are not in a hurry to get permission.
According to experts, this is a very disturbing sign.
In the run-up to the world's championship, the authorities will urgently have to figure out how to accommodate all the guests of the city.
Interviewers Rosbalta believe that due to the tournament the rent of rented apartments will increase by 10-30 per cent and will have to be repaid after the take-over champion.
The World Cup has led the authorities to pay attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to a law specifically written under primacy, each hotel in St. Petersburg must undergo a classification procedure and prove that it is in line with the stated number of stars and the level of service.
It is now clear that not all will succeed: the hotelers are so afraid of the checks that they often do not even send papers to the Federal Antimonopoly Service for Petersburg.
According to head Vadim Vladimirov, the department has studied 138 hotels and is now planning 34 hotel cases, many of which simply did not respond to antimonopolitans.
There are signs that the management of three dozen companies deceived the city by posting a number of stars in advertising, noted Vladimirov.
The problem is, right now, literally every number, no one can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship, the dentists will take over all the Peterburg hotels.
At present, tourists can count on 30,500 numbers in the city.
According to Smurf, 17 five-star hostels in St Petersburg, 51 four-star hotel, 100 two- and three-star, 550 one-star.
According to the First Deputy Committee for Tourism Development, only 23 hotels have so far passed the classification, and so many of the companies accredited in Petersburg have conducted such checks.
Whether or not a hotel has ordered such a procedure from regional enterprises, it is not known to the Smurf in an astounding circumstance.
So there may be more of these classifications, but no one knows.
“The last half-years of the hotel have not been very willing to go through the classification”, acknowledged the Director of the North-West Office of the Russian Union tour industry Ekaterina Shadskaya.
This is due to the high season, during which the hotel earns the most money and refuses to do other business.
Another reason is the budgets in which verification costs have not been incurred, and the procedure may be followed by a hotel depending on the status of between 30 and 100,000 roubles and more.
Recently, however, hotel managers became more active and began applying for the classification, assured Shadsky.
The hotel must succeed until 1 July 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine but will not yet be entitled to work in the world championship.
It is already known that depending on the starryness, a fixed fee for the hotel will be developed during the tournament.
The formulas for which the value will be calculated will be published next year.
This was done in order to prevent prices from entering 200-300 per cent, as is the case, for example, during the Peterburg Economic Forum.
You have to have a conscience and not let a raise double or three times, but you have to give the hotel a chance to make a living.
“I think it’s going to grow to 50%”, explained the President of the Russian Hotel Association Gennady Lamshin.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not sure that price fixing is in line with the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how much this puts into economic theory, but I hope this measure is justified.
"This is better than unstoppable travel," he said.
It's not clear what's going to happen to popular cheap hosts.
Members of the Parliament have passed a bill requiring guests to be prohibited from living in their homes.
It is highly hoped that this law will not be passed or will not apply to Petersburg.
"We will defend the view that the hostess must be preserved," says Nana Gwachi.
However, she said that the owners of the mini-housers should in any case be prepared to tighten the Housing Code.
If the Goslem approves the bill, about 80 per cent of the hostess will be closed in Petersburg, and at the moment there are 1.5 thousand numbers.
According to the President of the Federation of Restaurants and Hotels in North-West Leonid Garbar, two- and three-star hotels are lacking in Petersburg, which are also required by football fans, but there is a disruption to four-star and five-star hotels.
This situation is similar to the situation in which “75,000 Vips sit at 80 thousand stadiums”.
This can be corrected at the expense of mini-housers.
Their possible prohibition is considered by the expert to be "idiotism": "I find it strange that some people may live in apartments, but here's why they can't come."
If a hostel is used as a dorm, I agree it's wrong.
But if, as a hotel where guests arrive for a short time, why not?
Mini-hospitals risk missing the world's championship on football and because of their intransigence.
Hundreds of small hotels simply fail to pass the classification, and they do so on their own.
By summer 2016, all city hotels will be ordered.
“Companies that may carry out this procedure are not so many, so they will refuse less-paid orders from mini-houses and will choose which journeys”, noted Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the checks carried out so far are much higher than those in St. Petersburg.
The reason for the Peterburg delay is also related to the permanent changes in the Government ' s tourist block, which does not contribute to the smooth work.
According to experts, if all are lacking in Peterburg hotels, it is likely that there will be a need to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday homes.
For example, the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg could mobilize the river fleet, i.e. guests of the tournament can live in the cabins.
In addition, many fans will arrive in vans prepared to stay overnight.
"It's important not to set so many hotels that they leave," I'm sure Gennady Lamshin.
Also very popular during football championships will be rented accommodations.
Most likely, there will be a reserve of rented apartments in the city.
The rent rate will be 10-30 per cent.
“From the obvious - the first to leave accommodation near the stadium”, noted a specialist in renting the Agency for Development and Real Estate Research, Larissa Bragina.
However, the rental price may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in the sleeping areas.
This would also be facilitated by the construction of new transport links on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
It is also important to remember the human qualities of the citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is confident that Petersburg has always been a hospitable city in which people not only point the road but can also take a mini tour.
There are complications.
In 1970, my father met a family in the yard from Murmansk, a father, a mother, and two children.
They found it difficult to sleep on the train station.
"And the pope brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," remembered the interlocutor.
True, I added that now there is no such thing in the people of the city - to call their homes having consequences and terrible consequences.
But in 2018, after the failure of the House, the mistakes of the hotel and government will have to be remembered.
Girinovsky "Slill" Amur region.
He looked with admiration at the Girinovsky clown in Gosdom today.
He did things like that when our generation was just learning to trade newspapers, and it's still in perfect shape.
The topic of the speech, it seems, is the “LDPR protest against the results of the Amour elections”.
The protocols do not shake; there are no other protocols, except those signed by the selections, which appear to have been signed by the LDPR.
Here he raises Ivan Abram's second position and shouts something like, "This is the winner of the election!"
And then there's nothing that comes up on Rodney, and then, after the fight with the president, they're taking the faction out of the conference room, and it's like, "You're all with the fronts of your knots and crows."
The press, of course, emphasizes, not Abramov, but scandal and demarche faction as a result of this scandal and insult.
It's really Wolfovich's beautiful and elegantly merged the Amur region together with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is the next Gjirinovsky-style "Podnaki" out of protest, not the political party against the results of specific elections.
And the faction has been formally scandalized, and the elections, if you believe the party's website and Facebook Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the leader with the topic is clearly coming down.
He gives the dead in Amur himself to bury his dead, and he himself gives good news against the One Russia in general and should not be a relative.
It's an excellent decision not to lose a person, not in a real, show-off scandal.
Another thing that is now in a strange situation is Abraham's own.
In addition to the influence of the authorities, he did not wait for anything, there are no alternative protocols in his hands.
It is not the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but, on the other hand, for a narrow circle, it has become a formal occasion for insulting a respected champion, and, even cooler, the Ham attacks to the ER and to the ONF.
And there, of course, he needs to think seriously about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the elections, policy No. 2 of the region and candidate No. 1 of the region's only one-mandable district, it can become a pariah that has been successfully used by its own party leadership and superintendent for the same UNF and party leadership of a stranger.
Surely Girinovsky would not have been here, and he should have been thought of and observed with honor.
The trampoline is still growing and growing.
There was a news report that the LDPR would return to the hall at the time of the next prisoner.
I mean, the bathroom fell out of nowhere.
The only thing that buried Abramov.
It's beautiful indeed.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe could not accept all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama referred to the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Center in Oxford on ethics studies at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Great Britain.
He stated that in the present circumstances, the interests of mankind must be higher for individual countries or even for continents.
He also stressed that, although it was admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was not adequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama spoke highly of the actions being taken by Germany and Austria in response to the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
“The care of thousands of refugees is excellent, but at the same time you must also think about durable solutions, how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries”, he stressed.
After all, we need to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force never solved these problems," he added.
With regard to violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George Bush following 9/11 terrorist acts, stating that the United States had launched a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that it was possible to address this problem through non-violence.
I know that his intentions were good, but he used force, and that caused unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have swallowed a hand disinfectant over the past four years
The toxicological centres in the United States reported a nearly 400 per cent increase since 2010, the number of children under 12 years of age who had swallowed a disinfectant for high alcohol-containing hands, according to the Georgia State toxicological centre.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia State Toxicology Centre, the cases of fluids for disinfection of the hands reported in the toxicological centres increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
“Children contact these substances more often, and unfortunately, some percentage goes to the ambulance department”, said López CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant fluid specifically, and some do so to impress their friends, or to argue for social networks.
Youtube videos show teenagers drinking disinfectant fluid as cheap drinks.
Adolescents reportedly mixed disinfectant with alcohol-containing fluid to swallow their mouths in order to obtain a stronger drink.
Children of younger age may be attracted by the pleasant smell of disinfectant fluid.
"The kid doesn't think it's gonna hurt him," Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (disinfecting fluids for the hands) are those that are flavoured.
There are disinfectant hand fluids with the smell of strawberries, grapes, oranges that are very attractive to children.
Hand disinfectant contains somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol.
Small children, especially a few sprays, can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's a high concentration alcohol," said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Steven Thornton, the chief doctor of the toxicology center at the University of Kansas Hospital.
You wouldn't just leave a whisky in there, but people are holding onto these disinfectants for their hands, and if the kids get to them, it's a quick way to use a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed a hand disinfectant with a tubular aroma of about four sprays, was sent to the emergency ward for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179 times higher than that of an adult who was legally considered to be in an alcoholic state, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center not far from Atlanta.
Naija was confused and unable to walk when she was brought to the ambulance.
The doctors watched her all night in a separate baby clinic to avoid missing any signs of brain injury, as the girl fell and hit her head with alcohol, Ritchie said.
"That was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, the mother of Naji.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-spiratory substances or disinfectant napkins, in addition to removing disinfectant fluids for the hands of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are associated with death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, not ethyl alcohol, which was identified as an active substance.
In January, three students in the fourth grade in the north of New York agreed to poison them to the “other” teacher through the “proliferation of antibacterial substances in the class”, according to the police report.
The teacher has a strong allergy to hand disinfectors, and she has forbidden to keep them in her class.
Police believe that the failed plan was “empty talk” and addresses discipline to the school district.
As the oldest library for children in Barnaul, she became a family club.
On the back of the gravel at the entrance to the country’s N.K. Children’s Library, Krumsky saddens the rat owl.
The children who follow the books try to feed her with confetti.
Several generations have been attending this library for 95 years.
The very first readers of the twentieth century performed loud readings, performed performances according to Mayakovsky’s poems, conducted literary Victorians, and copied with Lenin’s wife.
The census continued for four years, and, according to the newspaper Young Stalinist in 1939, the “friendship between the Hope of Constantinople and the friends of the children’s library of Barnaula” became stronger every day.
Hope Constantinovna even sent a child’s picture to faraway Barnaulian friends once.
And when the barnaulians asked if Nadezhda Constantinovna wanted the library to be named, she said no, no objection.
The writings have long been kept in the museum, and the grandchildren and great - grandsons of the early readers have to explain why the hard profile adorns the library building.
During the years of restructuring, people often called, and they resented: Why are children’s libraries not renamed?
Let there be a library of the name of a good child writer, no political color!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it were.
Krupska is probably the most famous and favorite library in Barnaul, like "densal" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby, a yellow brick track.
"The Wizard of an Emerald City" is the favorite theme of the artist Olli Moskowka.
Olya used to be the manager of the law firm, come to work at eight, go out at five, and all the other managers were different only by love of drawing.
And then she found on the Internet an announcement, "You need an illustrator for the book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called My Cancer Mommy, "My Momma's Cancer."
Olya was doing illustrations, and I thought that life could end at any time, and there would be no miracles in it if you didn't create them yourself.
She now works in a library, illustrates children's books to writers all over the world, and makes up stories herself.
It is traditionally believed that children lose interest in the book that they are increasingly living in some virtual space...
But we have children reading, and their parents understand the meaning of reading, says the Russian Planet, director of the Tatian Kushweed Library.
In recent years, we've even had a moment of confidence that a children's library is needed, and it's going to live -- kids coming here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
In the library lobby, there's a large exhibition with a photo update.
New photographs of readers who go to the library as a family are displayed every quarter: Mom, Dad, and the children.
The library rejoices to see the children more and more alike.
If the child read the whole of Chukovsky at the age of two, he needs books more complex.
But now there is a law by which eight-year-old Vunderkindu is prohibited from issuing 12+ books.
To get a book like this, a child has to bring parents with him -- they come back, then they come back again, and gradually, Krupsky becomes like a family club to them.
In the library, there are treasures -- a pre-revolutionary collection of ravines and poems, to guide Korolenko in the annex to the magazine "Niva", to sew "Murzilka" in 1936.
Because now we're not just the conceptual space of the Book Temple, we're now open to movement, we're trying to become a special place: not a home, not a job, not a school, explains Tatiana Kushweed.
We can come to read, play, paint together.
We've made a play zone for the kids, the baby comes just to play, and the hand still goes to the book!
Some of our readers are carried away by their parents, and they lean on their feet, and they don't want to leave.
Mothers with wheelchairs often come, and we are pleased that they put the library first among all the other places to come with the little ones.
Tatyana Kushweed says: "Today's children, just like we used to, love classical children's literature:
“The publishing business is on the move, and a lot of attention is paid to authors who are intergenerational links.”
And when it comes to little babies, it's important that they be some hero who travels from one book to another.
Children don't like to break up with their heroes.
The Library regularly publishes tracts for parents who explain what is happening in modern children’s literature, which books are worth paying attention to, and why.
Booklets are so exciting and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library isn't for them.
Books outside the reading room are prohibited for adults.
Only children have this magical privilege.
...the library room itself has a square hatch with an ancient wooden ladder in the basement, in a bookstore.
The feet are going to snap at you, it's a very old time machine.
You're dating your childhood book, like an old friend: Hi, it's good that you and I don't change.
Allie's still walking funnyly on the road with a yellow brick, so Tol Ryzikov's tapes are stealing magic matches, and Malchish Kibalchish didn't say that to the damned bourgeoises of the Military Secret -- that's his strong word.
Books such as passwords, anywhere, can be found on them.
There's a storehouse and real book rares - for example, a pre-revolutionary collection with poems and eras.
Or take Corolenko to the famous annex to the magazine "Niva".
Or a 1936 Murzilka lining.
The time had grown old, and they were adorned with tea.
These publications are no longer available to readers.
It's a piece of our future collection, and I always dream of retiring and dealing with rare children's books.
But kids can't do that, so to speak, and the paints in the old books aren't very bright, and the topics... you open the first page, and there's Lenin, the party, the comsomol.
Now it seems like why did we all write this "Pionic Truth?"
But it was interesting, he says, "Russia Planet" by Galin Ilyasov, who runs the bookstore.
The countries of Murzilky have been darkened from time to time.
Galina Vasilevna's been running a bookstore for the rest of her life.
She knows the color of the stakes in Buratino, in which Harry Potter became captain of the Gryffindor team at the Quiddditch Championships, in which Carlson uses a silencer for a motorbike, and who works for Alice Seleznevo's father.
The librarian’s work pays little, and all those who can live without these books are quick to find another profession.
Only the most convinced remain: Enlighteners, educators, book worshipers.
They can also be found in a smile — it is considered to be a professional feature of a child librarian.
If he smiled at you in the first minute of the conversation, it's a professional.
I like children's books at all: how I like a librarian to make them stand flat and beautiful on the shelf, and I love reading them, says Galin Vasilevna.
I read everything: military, historical, fairy tales, fiction.
I read modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think everything was different when I was a kid.
The books were the most interesting and fascinating of all that happened to me at the time.
And since I loved them so much, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone sits and reads.
I hope the books will always be, despite the riders.
And I rejoice when our former readers bring children or grandchildren...
Rumormill: There are no differences in Seltika
Griffith's denial of the rumors of the Seltika differences after he admitted to Dale that Hups was in a bad position, but he's gonna fix it.
Harts will protest the Scottish Football Association's claim against Neilson and Warberton is afraid of signing contracts in January that may violate the unity of the team.
Donnes has increased the advantage of Seltika to five points.
In the first time, Adam Rune's Penalti gave Aberdine a small advantage over the Hamilton in Pitthodra, allowing Don's to get away from Seltica by five points.
Griffiths refuses to talk about differences
This caused rumors of differences in Seltika, which were interrupted by Griffiths, who claimed that he and his teammates were not suffering from any intensified criticism, in preparation for a meeting with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we feel the tension, I think the players are looking for it.
The Dutch are bored because the Scots aren't fighting for the title, de Bur.
Former Rangers half-protector and former Dutch member Ronald de Burt stated that Dutch football fans had lost interest in Seltika because he did not compete for the title of Rangers.
Where Buru, currently the representative of Ajaksa, said: "The Dutch are no longer showing the most attractive moments of the Seltica game, but why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension in the old firm games, and not just the people in Scotland want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," said Dale.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Seltik was in trouble, but the Norwegian coach promised to change everything.
After defeating Malmö and leaving the League of Champions shortly after losing 10 Aberdina football players, which now takes five points to the top of the table.
But Dale said, "The Selite has had bad times before, and we'll be out again."
Now we want to get out of this as quickly as possible.
I realize it's very annoying, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's going on.
And so are we, but we have to keep going.
And really, we really need Seltica's support because it makes players so much better.
Staying together now is so important.
Warberton looks forward to the January transfers.
Despite the views that appeared just a few weeks ago, suggesting that he had identified some of the goals of January transfers, boss "Ringers" Mark Warberton was distrustful of the January campaign, claiming that he did not want to destroy the unity of the team.
The former attackor, Brentford, said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the season starts to adapt them, which you have seen in our own group this season.
The team's working really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Mitch, who's interested in Seltika, hinted at the end of his career.
Swonsy Mitch, who was connected to Seltik during the transfer window, implied that he could leave football after his contract with the Swans.
A 29-year-old player suffered from problems with his ankle for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
Harts is going to stand up to SFA on Neilson's statements.
"Harts" said with account 2:1 when they removed Patterson, and began to lose 3:2, but the red card of the defence was later cancelled; it was the third red card of Collum, cancelled in eight months.
Neilson does not give up on his words, saying, "I didn't question ethics, I didn't comment on the game."
Griffith vowed to avoid Tyncastle
The stubborn player of the Hybernian team got the excuse after he admitted that he sang a song with insulting words about former gambler Rudy Scatzel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn area in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Derby in Tinkasle began in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was a burner," the assailant said, "I can safely say that I wasn't going to go back to Tyncastle if he didn't play for Seltic.
Donnelly: Tannadis' advice is confident in the management of "Dandy United"
Simon Donnelly argues that the Board of Directors of Dundi United remains confident that the management team will change the situation to a better one, but agrees that the deterioration in the field should end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We're gonna get the guys out again," Donnelly said.
I'm glad McInnes won Hamilton's "unbeautiful"
Derek McInness admitted that his team, Aberdine, had to fight desperately against Hamilton Assis to win the seventh round in the league's championship, which put them five points higher than the Seltica, on the top of the tournament table, thanks to Adam Runey's penance in the first time.
McInness said, "There's no team here to win anything, a cup or a league champion who didn't win meetings like that."
Unemployment rates among Scottish people remain unchanged, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is increasing
UNIT IN Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was higher in the United Kingdom by 5.5 per cent, according to figures from the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland has dropped by 12,000 people in three months, with a total of 2,612,000 currently employed.
The employment rate for Scotland fell by one quarter to 74.0 per cent, above the average figure of 73.5 per cent for the United Kingdom.
Scottish Minister David Mandell, commenting on the latest figures, noted: “The long-term plan of the Government laid the foundations for strengthening the economy”.
It has been almost a year since Scotland made a historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the labour market in Scotland in terms of increasing employment and reducing unemployment.
Why I'm a witness to the Oklahoma execution
Today, by avoiding legal interference at a late stage, I will watch as a person is executed.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting on the death row of the death row in Oklahoma State Prison when Richard Glassip is executed with a lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
For the first time, this request was made in January, because of his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As this day approached, I began to fear.
So why do that?
I agreed, because I thought it was a good way to tell the detailed history of the death penalty.
That would offer a unique view.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and because those who wish more than seats, the results of the dark lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of seats for the press decreased from 12 to five.
Whoever's chosen will look at it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit with Richard Glosip's closest friends, and we've had our own relationship with him after a few months of phone calls and one visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We laugh often when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed to take the notebook and pen to record what I see.
I'm gonna have to try and remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of acting impartially on Twitter.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner the story in the way he likes it, he gets access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she could say better than herself, but she still thinks I'm wrong about what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with one of the things I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me to write, and I wouldn't do it, even if he did.
I told him he could take me off his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that publicity will help the death penalty movement.
Kim Bellwer, reporter from Haffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I wrote down.
I'm not going to go into detail here again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glassip is not to blame.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treese make him guilty of aiding a crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that the evidence for the death sentence was insufficient.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this point on, I'm going to watch him die.
I can't say I'll be totally objective.
There will be other reporters to turn to.
From me, you'll know what it's like to watch the person I like die without need.
The man being chased by the police has been ordered to leave the Canning River
Constable from Canning Veil managed to get a man out of the Kanning River and stay dry.
Perth was planning to leave the police, but he couldn't, stuck in dirty water on a mollusk in a few metres from a police officer trying to “swift him out onto the shore”.
The Kanning Weila police were summoned on Tuesday for illegal entry into the territory of Buckingham.
When the police spotted the suspect, he tried to get away from them by leaving for Canning.
But he didn't swim far.
"He stood in the water and said, "I won't go out, come on, grab me," said Senior Sergeant Chandelle Castledine.
Constable Laklan Perkhavets didn't want to urinate, so he used a more secure reception, "negotiations with a good police officer".
"Sometimes people do strange things to try and escape," says Sergeant Castledine.
That's what the football champion Ben Kazins remembered.
In 2006, Kazins left for the ditch to avoid meeting a police patrol to check for alcohol, and tried to cross Swan.
His efforts have been in vain, but have led locals to invent a joke called "Biathlon Ben Kazins".
Peter Moody accuses the flight attendants of attempted espionage and threatens to leave horse sport
Peter Moody accused the stewards of Racing Victoria of trying to introduce a spy into his stable last year and threatened to leave his horse sport immediately.
His target was the flight attendants and the staff of the Ethics Division of Racing Victoria, who he accused of having organized a campaign against him personally, and the withdrawal of Lady Tatai from the launch because of a violation of the rules of the day of the drug use on Wednesday became the last straw.
Mudhi told Fairfax Media that he was always making every effort to participate in the jumps, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to the positive outcome of Lidari's Kobalt test, which he could not explain.
He kept his tongue on suspicions of spying for a year and a half and didn't want it to look like green grapes.
"I didn't mean to say anything about it, and I've endured a long time, but sometimes it beats you so much out of your lap that you don't hold back anymore," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
Today I'm going home and I'm going to sleep hard.
I want to walk with my head up and I want my owners to know that I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they start to think that's not true, then I'm gonna have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Moody had previously made a sensational statement during his interview with racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy on his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I'm going to name, if they ask, and offered him a job in my stable to convey information about what I'm doing in my stable," Moody told Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, no doubt they should all make statements because trying to catch me did not succeed.
Robert Rolston, former President of RVL, David Moody, current President of RVL, and Bernard Sondry, former Executive Director of RVL, knew about this all the time and know it now.
Shouldn't that make me think this is getting personal?
Should not RVL be bold and call for an answer for what is happening in this business, other than coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Is that how bad I am for this profession?
Maybe people out there think it is.
Maybe they should take my license and push me away, and I don't doubt what I'm saying right now could make them think about it.
But I just got to the point where I don't care, and it's gonna hurt me.
I'm really sad about this.
I will put pressure on them and hold them responsible for making a decision.
I have family support, and I can leave.
The coach's boredom only grew during a long investigation into the Cobalt and Lidari case, and the last horse removed from the start forced him to claim that he could “wire his license onto the table”.
Moody, most well known for preparing the invincible Black Caviar champion, described the requirements for medical treatment on the day of the competition as “fun” after a clay compression was placed on the horse’s feet, which was a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the rules on jumps.
"I must be fully responsible for this," he said.
One of my employees made a mistake compression on her leg.
She could have had a compression last night.
She could have gotten it yesterday, just like it was.
She was with him the day she got away.
Moody may be disqualified for three months under medical regulations on the day of competition for the use of compression, which has been investigated by the stewards.
It's anecdote.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but it's gone too far," Moody said.
Driver who made the hit and hid from the incident in Kobram arrested
The police arrested a man who crashed a motorcyclist in Kobram on the weekend and hid himself from the scene.
The motorcyclist was brought on a helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on Murray Valley Hawaii on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured rider.
On Monday, 50 years old, the city of Natalia surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with leaving the scene, not providing assistance and violating other traffic rules.
A motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Kobrama, remains in a stable hospital.
"Melburn Storm" coach Craig Bellamy is blaming rivals' accusations of violent incursions.
"Melburn Storm" coach Craig Bellamy called criticizing the interception of his team's ball as a "integration of the agenda" by the two champions of the NRL champion.
Sydney Rusters coach Trent Robinson stated that the judges allowed Storm to fight his team during the sudden victory of Storm at the qualified game final in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennett's British Broncos coach made a clear hint at Storm after his team won the finals of the qualified tournament at the New Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called this game a "typical" for the league reggae and stated that two of Queensland's teams were not "very successful" in a handball fight.
Bellamy defended the interception by his team and stated that they were simply focused on the "contact" by intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was confident that his team should be criticized by two leading coaches, which meant that they were concerned about the possible defeat of Storm.
"This continues to come -- I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about tough receptions when they played us at 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can be sure that we haven't changed anything in our systems or our defenses for a year, just in the last six weeks, we've been paying particular attention to the contacts when the ball was intercepted, and that's a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years, and he's obviously been training an excellent team, so he's probably not used to losing, and it's been a bit of a shock to him.
Funny how it's always shown this time of year.
Bellamy disputed Bennett's idea of an impressive football, reminding his teacher that St. George-Illavarra Dragons Bennett won the 2010 championship, showing him a "stupid" football.
Wayne's talking about an exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with our Friday night, and to see how impressive their game was," Bellami observed.
I remember that St. George in 2010 was very critical of what he called a boring team, and Wayne said it was none of his business.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks is an impressive football, especially his young half-protectors at their speed.
It's a football you'd like to play when you're playing games like this.
He made this remark in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style -- not every team has two half protectors like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to play it like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they got to big games.
Bellamy also noted that the game Storm and Rusters was a competition with a lot of points than the game Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
He was in our game at 8:18, there were two other attempts - and what, is that an impressive football?
Or consider impressive breaks and failed attempts?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can meet them there.
Storm's at the end of this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or Crown Sharks on the next Saturday night at the pre-finals at AAMI Park Stadium, tickets will be available for sale next Tuesday morning.
The Serbian drug-preservation defendant is being bailed out at $200,000
A man at risk of life imprisonment for trying to embezzle 40 kg of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released on bail of $200,000.
Marco Maximovic, 29 years old, one of the five people arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on the Solay yacht, which came from South America through Vanuatu and parked in Kumera in August.
During the morning, Maximovic and his associates saw at the marina, and later he met with them at the Coomer Roadhouse cafe, where the police found 40 kilos of drugs in the Toyota Echo car.
Despite the fact that Maximovicu is at risk of life expectancy for attempted drug use in quantity sufficient for sale, Mr. Maksimović argues that the evidence that the latter attempted to obtain the whole party is missing and that a man could be in a café without any intention.
Judge Peter Flanagan of the Supreme Court doubted that Maximovic had to be released on bail.
The latter has connections with Serbia.
He travels frequently to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Mothers and Father Maximovic were invited to make a joint pledge of $200,000 for his release.
“It is obvious from both statements that the amount of $200,000 is too much of a financial burden for them”, said Judge Flanagan.
But one measure was not enough to guarantee that he would not disappear, the judge added.
Maximovic was allowed to be released on bail, provided that he would surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, be observed in the police daily and observe the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Photos of Katsikaris: "I'm proud of the Greek assembly that's fought to the last seconds."
The main coach of the Greek team, Fótis Katsikaris, paid tribute to his team after the 1/4 Eurobasket-2015 final with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game was determined by some mistakes.
It was a big game, quoting AFP Katsikaris.
We were preparing for a great game of Spanish performance.
They tried to work in defense, but the defense errors determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my boys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: "I will be assigned to the Kauna functions in the CSA."
The newbie of the CSCA, Joel Frilland, said he doesn't believe in a curse of the Army.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to break the negative trend and finally win Euroliga next season.
I've been talking to Coach Dimitris Itudis this summer, and, on my own, after I joined the team, quote "R- Sport" Freeland, and I'm actually going to be assigned the functions of Sasha Kauna, who left the team, both in the defense and in the three-second attack, and I think I can handle it.
Yeah, I'm going to need some time to restructure to the central position, but at NBA I played more forward.
Now, we're going to have to fight more against the big center rivals, but I've done this before, so I think, and I'm going to do it now.
The Armenians last won the Euroliga in 2008.
Since then, six times they've gone to Finala Four, but they couldn't show their best basketball there.
It's supposed to be a good idea for the team.
That's the game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's complicated, I understand the frustration of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can do, we have a good chance of winning Euroliga, I really think.
I've always wanted to win this title, and the Mosquitos have already won the tournament, and I think this year is the year CSCA.
As far as the eye is concerned, I'm not a superstitious man, and I don't believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, anything is possible.
I don't have any rituals before games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Louis Enrique: "To me, the Roma match will be special."
Louis Enrique, chief coach of Barcelona, did not hide what he returned to Rome at the 1st tournament group tournament of the League of Champions with Roma with special feelings.
According to the mentor, the eyepiece of his current and former team would be far from regular for him.
Recall that Luis Enrique trained “wolks” in the 2011/12 season, but he failed to show himself on the best side in the capital city of Italy.
I returned to Rome a few years later, for which I have gained some experience.
I have very warm memories with Rome.
It's a special game for me, but it doesn't matter.
The main thing is to start the League of Champions with a victory.
The August meeting in Kukuk won't affect the action of the teams in the nearest match.
I'm looking forward to the Roma game she showed in A series against Juventus.
It's a strong team that can press and knows what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: “Craznodar has different options for attacking.”
Vadim Skripchenko, Chief Coach in charge of the 9th Prime League match with Cranodar, noted a variety of attacking schemes by the rival team.
According to the mentor, the bulls have several models of the game in their arsenal to attack.
It will take place on 21 September and start at 16.30 Moscow time.
As we play with Beauty, we'll see, it's official website called Urala Skripchenko.
We've got a whole week of training ahead of us.
This team has different types of attacks, it's a variety of attacks, but we're not slow, so I think it's going to be a very interesting game.
In anticipation of this game, given that "Craznodar" is holding the League of Europe match against the Dortmund “Brussia”, we will try very well to prepare to win.
Roher Kanyas: "Astana House" can take points from anyone.
Astana half-beneficiary Roher Kanyas, after the 1st round of the League of Champions group tournament with Benfiqa (0:2), expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's future game.
According to Havbek, the Astanas are able to take points from any rival.
Even though the match got tough for us, I can tell you that we played well, bringing in the official website of the UEFA Kanyas word.
The Benfica is higher than the class, but in the home game, I think we can count on them to pick out their points.
That's pretty real.
But first we have to think about Galatasarea and then the Atletico.
At home games, we can take points at anyone.
Rafael Benitez: "I'll do it again every time: Kristiana Ronaldo is the best in the world."
Raphael Benitez, the main coach of the Reala, expressed satisfaction with the great victory in the 1st round of the League of Champions Group tournament with Shahter (4:0).
The specialist paid tribute to Krishtian Ronald, who became the author of the three heads.
Match was tough, because Shahter knows how to use the ball, which brings up the official Web site of the WEFA word of Benitez.
The opponent did not have many moments, but their counterattacks are always dangerous.
I'm not saying Real was perfect, but we've had enough naked opportunities.
I'm glad we didn't miss the ball and killed four.
Kristian Ronald confirmed his level.
This is the best game in the world, I'll repeat it every time.
Jordy Alba: "Kristian Ronald cannot be like Messy."
The Barselon Protector, Jordy Alba, believes that no one can compare himself to his one-club Lionel Messy.
According to the Spanishman, the real-estate forvard Krishtian Ronaldo can't do that either.
Massey's five heads above the others, quoting Le Figaro Albu.
Even Kristian Ronald.
With Leo in the field, everything changes, I can't compare it to anyone.
Daniele De Rossi: Barcelona has not only a unique style, but also a bright personality.
Romano halfback Daniele De Rossi on the eve of the League of Champions group tournament with Barcelona noted the importance of compactness and insurance in a game with such a strong rival.
The meeting will be tomorrow, starting at 21.45 Moscow time.
Let's remind you that the S.E.A. will broadcast it.
Barcelona is a special rival, a good team with great players, quoting the official website of WEFA De Rossi.
It's hard to play with the blue grenades, because they have not only unique styles, but also vivid identities.
To leave them, we'll have to smell all over the game and babysit each other.
Massey is almost always successful when walking around, so we need to keep it compact and organized.
Ejov hopes to go to the start-up SCA in the "Sladen" match.
Holkiper SKA Ilya Eżov stressed that he hoped to join the army at the next KHL champion's match.
Ezov went on ice instead of Mikko Koskinen for the 23rd minute at 0:3 and reflected all the brooches on his gates, the fourth goal of SKA missed after replacing the doorman with the sixth field player.
The next match, the team will take the lead on a road trip to Slovenia.
I hope to get out in the next match in the start-up, by saying, "R- Sport" by Jehova.
I'm not a doorman, I'm a doorman, and we don't have the replay of the missing heads, so it's hard to track.
"Dynamo" played well, everybody has bad matches.
The team has lost anyway.
I'd rather skip bigger, but the team won.
Safarzhowa went to a hospital with a viral infection.
Lucy Shafarzova is hospitalized with bacterial infection, says AFP.
The Czech tennis player is currently in the clinic in Brno.
The deadline for the restoration of the Roland Garros-2015 finalist is unknown.
Let us also recall that on Monday, Shafarzhov rose to one line in WTA rating and is now the fifth missile of the world.
Stephen Hogg used a girl's phone to get pedophiles to send photos.
Pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for images of violence against children.
Stephen Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, registered with the Internet Service for sending messages where he received a number of obscene images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found the missing phone, and found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She checked it and found shocking photos, and she immediately drew her mother’s attention to it.
The police arrived and saw five images, followed by a survey of the computers found at this address, and found “suitable” requests in the search system using words to detect inappropriate images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he had done it because it could "bring the pedophiles" and then he would "be pretended to be a cop to scare them".
Authorized judge Elied Robertson informed the sheriff's court in Dundee: "He claimed it was an addiction, he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted to making requests on the computer, but he said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was interviewed about the conversation with an unknown person who sent him images and asked to send more pictures.
He said he was doing it to lure them.
He said he had a problem with his head when he was drinking and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When a girl found pictures on the phone, she called her mother, screamed and cried.
She saw obscene images on the phone, and then the accused had an eye rate.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the accused had used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road, Dundy, found himself guilty of having been accused of making obscene photographs of children on 14 June last year, violating the terms of the pledge on 25 January this year and failing to appear before the trial on 24 March this year.
Counsel to the respondent, Gregor Sim, filed an application not to bring Hogg to the list of perpetrators of sexual offences, as it could be demonstrated that there was no “significant sexual element” in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence until October until receipt of a social service report.
Hogg was released on bail in the case, but he was taken into custody before hearings on other outstanding cases began.
He was listed as having committed sexual offences before the date of sentencing.
President of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe reads the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's senior state leader, had fallen from the podium earlier this year.
He didn't get hurt, but the fall video was instantly distributed through social networks.
The opening of Parliament was also marred by statements by parliamentary opposition officers that they had received anonymous threats to prevent them from whistle-blowing Mugabe during the hearing.
A month ago, they elevated the President during his address to the nation in Parliament, which Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
A member of Parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change, Innocent Goneze, said that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning not to interrupt Mugabe's speech.
“The message came from a number that was not displayed, but it was entitled “Death”, he informed journalists after the speech Mugabe had been completed.
It warned the members of Parliament that inviolability would end in Parliament ' s building and that, as soon as they left, parliamentary inviolability did not work.
A member of Parliament said that the party headed by Morgan Tswangirai was “settled” by the threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will cut to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs within its restructuring and cost-reduction programme.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard is divided into two listed companies, separating computers and printers from more rapidly developing hardware and service industries.
The estimated reduction in jobs would amount to approximately US$ 2.7 billion, starting in the fourth quarter, as indicated in the Hewlett-Packard statement.
“This restructuring will ensure a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise”, said Meg Whitman, Chairman and Director-General Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more focused than Hewlett-Packard at present, and business direction portfolios will be wider and deeper, which will help move the company to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than ever before to respond to the growing demands of our clients around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will benefit more than $50 billion each year and will “focus on providing previously unattainable integrated technology solutions” to companies, the company said.
This is the case with the company founded in the 1930s by the Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard for electrical equipment; their garages in Palo Alto called “the place of birth of the Silicon Valley”.
Hewlett Packard is undergoing extensive reorganization in order to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This is the step of HP, the second computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest US technical companies, which is a recent development in this sector, based on the confidence that highly specialized companies work better.
Captain Arsenala, Michel Arteta says his teammates must support Jack Wilshire's traumatized front game with Dinamo Zagreb.
In his conversation with Wilshire Wenger, he also stressed that it was only September, and that if Wilshire's recovery went according to plan, nothing would prevent him from returning to the game of Christmas.
With the most favourable development, Wilshire will miss at least four of the following games in England and, given what has happened, its participation in the European Championship will remain at stake the following summer.
Most recently, Wilshire was confident that he had completed the previous season with the only ankle injury and was about to return to the usual aggressive style of the game during pre-season training.
Wenger: "This injury doesn't threaten his career."
It's just not the end of the bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just a coincidence.
This has nothing to do with the ankles or injuries he's had before.
These may be medically related things, but as Wenger also admitted, there is a risk of further trauma to any player returning to the mid-season game.
There is also an adverse trend.
According to the Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has recorded 23 different injuries that occurred to him in six years since his debut.
In addition, he only played 65 of the 157 "Arsenal" in league in the last five seasons.
If you look at the schedule for "Arsenal" wider, you can see that in six of the eight seasons, starting in 2007-08, "Arsenal" was one of the two Premier League clubs that accounted for the most missed days of trauma.
Wenger recognizes the likelihood of a vicious encounter, but Arsenal believes that the improvement of injury statistics in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you're back in line after trauma, you're vulnerable for a while -- you need to regain your strength and gain competitive advantage," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to do it.
I hope he'll recover physically, I'm sure of it, as well as his career will be what he deserves.
Arsenal begins his campaign in the League of Champions on Wednesday with Dinamo-Zagreb and will continue it on Saturday in games with Chelsea and next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the composition.
Hector Bellierin and Aaron Ramsey did not come to Croatia, so Mother Debushi and Arteta are likely to be playing in the starting line.
Wenger may also introduce Kieran Gibbs and Olivia Giru in place of Nacho Moreala and Theo Wolcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give a little break to the players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is an unconditional favourite in group F, Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is among the most unfortunate in Europe.
Dinamo hasn't lost any of the 41 matches since they had last season as the Invincibles.
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was struck by an earthquake by 3.2 points on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal learned a lesson from last season when the team was defeated in the League of Champions of Monaco, and remains with little hope of bringing the club to victory in the Cup Championship final.
"It's an incredible drive," Wenger observed.
Arsenal's never done that before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but, on the other hand, I am realistic with the internship.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons about male friendship
The lack of such stories is reflected in the eyes, especially when it comes to the desperate need for men to be honest, now more than ever, with the suicide rate of young men being at the most in 15 years.
In 2013, this was the only major cause of men dying between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, with men being three times more likely than women.
In an attempt to address the issue of Campania against Unhappiness, 2015 declared the Year of Men to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this battle to accept this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students who have symptoms of depression found that if a patient has a sufficient number of friends “in a normal mood”, the chances of treatment are doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of well - meaning friends halves the chances of mental disorders.
But, of course, that friendship should work, first of all, so that it should be.
In an era where communication is managed by social networks, when style prefers content, the speed of response is often more valuable than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to appear strong, loving joy and success, even if loneliness is real.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values — money, image, social status, all by virtue of internal values, our internal desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a stronger impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire recently observed, a video game maker, you're not gonna buy any more happiness for money.
The dignity of Friends is that they draw attention to it.
Each of the characters was defined, not by his own work, but rather by a person who showed up in association with friends.
Jowey's Yumor and Chandler's constant hugs, the moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross' breathing on Rachel's breath, are all based on the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from a complete study of their feelings.
As the Samaritans officer said to me, "...my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal, underlines how even the smallest community of friends can benefit."
Often, the men who approach us feel unable to talk to their friends.
Old teaching “live with it” is strong, as is the feeling that frank talk about problems can be perceived as weakness.”
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I'm trying to offer longer working coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the insignificant moments of male friendship.
With regard to my mission, the status of a foreigner speaking on the phone is helping people at times of despair, and long-term support comes from the immediate circle of family and friends.
So if you're going to visit FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where you completely restored the decorations for the holiday, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk for a drink.
Or better yet, if you see a single person in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
Not to be guessed at in advance what friendships can do.
The Friends show Comedy Central from the beginning to the end, all 236 series, by tag #FriendsFest
Di Maria's going to score a goal by helping her beat the Malmö.
Angel de Maria is equal to Blaise Matthewyde and Edinson Kavani celebrates killed swords at the gate of Malmö.
Angel de María, debuting in the Champions League, scored a goal that allowed "PJ" to easily bypass "Malmo" on Tuesday.
Here's the game report on the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel de Maria and Edinson Kavani did their job when Parry Saint-Jerman started his game at the Champions League with a very convenient 2-0 win against Malmö at Park de Prence Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria beat the ball less than four minutes after his first game in the Champions League was started as a gamer of "LJ" to set the champions of France, but they missed a number of opportunities until they finally increased their advantage when Kavani scored a goal in the 61st minute.
Along with Real Madrid and Donut Shahter in Group A, "Pari" had to take a good start in the game against the Swedish champions, because they did not aim for the playoffs, but for the continuation of a series of successful games in the last three seasons, where they reached the quarter finals.
They earned points, but at the same time it was not the best decision by Laurent Blanc to count Zlatan Ibrahimovic as useless in attacking and later to replace him in a field against a team from his hometown and club in which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win houses or guests in the Champions League, so to win with a score of 2:0, to bring problems to rivals and play an excellent defense is a good start, even if there are other moments that we will need to finish during the season," Blanc said.
It's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did it, although I regret that we didn't kill one or two more balls.
Ibragimovic returned after his injury to one of the replacements of the Paris team, which brought her nothing with a score of 2:2 in a match with "Bordo" in the First League on the weekends, but he was pushed off to the background of Di Maria for the fourth minute.
The Argentine assailant was noted as a gamer capable of bringing the "AIJ" to a new level in Europe after he was bought at Manchester United last month, and he proved why, when he ran for a trap from Marco Verratti behind the protection "Malmio" and beautifully completed the attack by sending the ball by Johan Willand to the far corner of the gate.
However, if someone was expecting an easy and great victory from the FTA then they had to be disappointed.
The Malmö, who won the Seltik in the Playoffs to get to that stage, with nine players at the world level in the field at the beginning of the game, five defence lawyers and two teammates in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But with the exception of Nicole Jurdžić's stroke, when the ball passed past the next bargae gate of Kevin Trapp for 34 minutes, they attacked very little.
At times, however, the FGM has failed to handle itself with insurmountable gears and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimović, who in the first half alone was unable to carry out at least five attempts, and then was unable to process the Kavani-killed ball immediately after the game resumed.
Nevertheless, he showed himself to be much more capable in the precise passages, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovich, who, after de Maria had sent the ball with a curved blow that had gone in touch with the pinch of Viland's minima for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally killed after an hour thanks to Kavana, the Uruguayan killed his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimovitch repaired the ball sent to the center of the field from the left flank of Maxwell.
This put an end to any of the ideas that Malmö had about getting back into the game, and only the interception of Wieland from the near distance did David Louis not allow the final account to be increased before Escéle Lavassisy was counted as a goal at the end of the match.
Coach "Malme" Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was classed above his team, and Norwegian said, "Our last game in the League of Champions was held in December of last year."
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish League, and that's not the level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Hail "Paris"!
It was a great match with them.
Glencore earns $2.5 billion for stock sales
The mining and trading giant Glencore in Switzerland, who was affected by the fall in commodity prices, earned $2.5 billion for the sale of shares as part of his grand debt reduction plan.
Glencore, listed at the London Stock Exchange, stated that it had sold new shares worth approximately Pound 1.6 billion to cover its debt.
The company, which lost 57 per cent of its market value, is trying to cope with the collapse of commodity prices while China's economy is declining demand and creating chaos in world markets.
Thanks to the issuance of new shares at a concessional price, the Glencore stock exchange at the London Stock Exchange took place at the early morning trades on Wednesday.
Shares jumped 2.77 per cent to 131.60 under the FTSE 100 index, which was traded 0.69 per cent higher at the opening.
Glencore launched a $2.5 billion stock sale last week under extensive plans to reduce its 30 billion debt by about a third.
The company sold 125 cents apiece, i.e. with a discount of 2.4 per cent at the price at the closing of tenders on Tuesday.
It placed 1.3 billion new shares, representing 9.99 per cent of the company's capital.
Due to concerns about the continued decline in the Chinese economy, the value of iron ore fell by about half, while coal, copper and other raw materials fell by 20 to 40 per cent.
White House confirms CJingpin's visit to Washington.
The White House confirmed on Tuesday in an official communication that China's head, Si Jingpin, would arrive with an official visit to the United States at the end of this month.
This visit, the first visit to Washington by CS Qingpin, will take place on 25 September and will be a retaliatory visit to Beijing last November by President Barack Obama, said in a statement.
The President and the First Lady of the United States, Michel Obama, will also accept CJingpin with her husband, Pang Liyuan, at a government dinner on the same day after the two leaders hold bilateral talks.
“President CJingpin's visit will provide an opportunity to enhance cooperation between the United States and China on common, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, as well as to allow the Presidents of the United States and China to deal constructively with the contentious issues”, the communication said.
Si Jingpin, whose first visit was announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle to meet with the leaders of several leading American technology companies on their way to Washington and then to New York to participate in the September General Assembly of the United Nations.
Obama and CJingpin are expected to discuss a number of contentious issues, including Washington ' s concerns about China ' s alleged cyberspace and China ' s rise in China ' s categorization on the subject of the disputed South China Sea.
A former biker in the Kutuzov fever was given two years in a colony.
In addition, the Court partially granted civil claims to the victims of Day Mirzoev amounting to 1.2 million rubles.
Moscow's Dorogomil court sentenced Dani Mirzoev, who was killed by a motorcycle driver at the Kutuzov Avenue in Moscow.
As reported in the Russian News Service, Mirzoev was sentenced to two years ' imprisonment in a settlement colony.
He is found guilty under the heading “Infringement of the rules of road traffic and of the operation of vehicles” of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
In addition, the Court has partially satisfied the civilian claims of 1.2 million roubles.
During the debate, the prosecutor had requested that Mirzoev be sentenced to three years ' imprisonment and that victims' claims should be collected to a full amount of eight million rubles.
The accident occurred on 22 May at about three o’clock in the 30 Qutuzov Avenue area.
The BMW vehicle, which was followed by Mirzoev, crossed the traffic lane and knocked down a motorcycle standing on the curb.
From the injuries sustained by a man in 1989, he died on the ground.
The friends of the deceased in social networks reported that the BMW driver was driving at a high speed and left for the roadside.
Fearing that the driver would try to escape from responsibility, the bikers set up a motorcycle run from the Horvier Mountains to Moscow's GUMVD building in Petrovka, 38.
Shortly thereafter, it became known that the result of the interrogation had delayed the alleged culprit.
In Moscow, a naked man was taken to the temple.
He behaved calmly and did not commit any wrongdoing, and the police gave him emergency psychiatric care to doctors.
Officials of the capital police detained a Moscow resident who had entered a temple without clothes.
It's reported to Moscow.
As the head of the press service GU MUD told in Moscow, Andrey Galiakberov, an incident took place on Tuesday, 15 September, around 4 p.m., on the Kashmiri highway.
A naked man entered the temple of St. Nicholas.
He behaved calmly and did not commit any wrongdoing.
The police have arrived at the scene on call.
Law enforcement officers were waiting for doctors from the Emergency Psychiatry Brigade and handed over to the man.
They became 26-year-old residents of Moscow.
Over 40 decrees and orders were signed by Vladimir Yakushev.
More than 40 decrees and orders were signed by the Governor of the Tumen Region, Vladimir Yakushev, at a meeting of the Bureau of the Regional Government.
Some of them involved funding for educational and health facilities in municipal education.
In particular, funds have been allocated for the purchase of a bus for one of the schools in the lower province, for the major repair of the district hospital in Kazan district.
As indicated in the accompanying documents, the money will be used to complete the major repair of the second floor of the therapeutic office.
The networks of hot and cold water, water supply, power grids and electrical equipment, ventilation systems will be repaired, building facades will be repaired, fire safety and energy saving activities will be implemented.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi from 17 to 18 September, in which the Tumen delegation will take the lead with the Governor.
The forthcoming event in Sochi and the interim results of cooperation are presented by the Honorary Consul-General of the Republic of Belarus in Tumena Vladimir Szugl, who is a member of the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovic, what are the tasks of the Sochi Forum?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Federal State.
It builds on the fruitful cooperation of the regions - important links between the two States.
The plenary is planned to be attended by President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Alexander Lukashenko of the Republic of Belarus.
The plenary and section meetings will focus on the experience of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in implementing industrial policies, regulations and programmes of the Federal State.
The Governor of the Tumen Region will address the forum.
I believe that this demonstrates successful, sustained interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of relevant ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also be present.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including those from the Tümen region, will work.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new profitable contracts and agreements.
I would add that the first such meeting was held in Minsk last June.
More than two hundred delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia, participated.
At that time, a very important cooperation agreement was signed between the Tuumen and Minsk areas.
The importance of our work is also expressed by the fact that a permanent seminar at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Russian Union and Belarus has been held in Tuumen.
In addition, the Tumenian region's APC delegation visited the Republic of Belarus to explore the experience of Belarus in the training of agricultural personnel, the identification of additional points of contact and the organization of new investment projects in the agro-industry sector.
Recently, you met with the head of the region and head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with the Governor of the Tumen Region, Vladimir Jakoushevy was talking about the region ' s cooperation with the Republic of Belarus under today ' s difficult conditions.
The issue of the supply of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms is raised, which is needed to lower the cost of end-user machinery.
Problems were discussed in the work of the prison shopping house Belšina and options for preventing losses.
Important issues, since investment projects should work clearly and bring profits to the region.
Further supplies of cargo and passenger equipment were referred to by OAO MAZ, the development of the OAO “MAZ” service centre, which was established in Tumen on the basis of OAO “TAPP”.
The discussion also focused on the preparation of a visit by the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus by the end of the year.
Another topic of discussion was the conclusion and signing of an agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technological and cultural cooperation of the Republic of Belarus and the Tümen Region.
Thus, the dynamics of relations promise a new level.
The regional centre was also concerned.
During the meeting with the head of the administration of the city of Tumena Alexander Moore, we talked about updating the prison bus park.
About 100 buses are already “snooping on incense”, so a new batch of vehicles from Belarus will be required to operate on gas, clean fuel.
Another aspect: The Tümen elevator plant cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of elevator products of OAO Mogilevliftmash, receiving kits.
In my view, these activities could become more active, given the programmes for the installation of new elevators at the regional centre.
I would add that, within the framework of the expanded authority of the Consul, a meeting was held with Governor of the Kurgan Region, Alexe Kokorin, during which discussions were held on the question of increasing the trade and supply of modern Belarusian equipment in Zaire.
At the end of September, a meeting was planned with the Ottoman governor.
The extended Consular district consists of five RF entities, but Tumen can be described as its own headquarters.
The region is a field for multi-pronged projects, including the work of an honorary Genkonsul.
In general, such meetings are meaningful and good, which allow for a direct and rapid solution to many of the problems, easing them and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the present environment, it is essential not to destroy the task by continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon opposed focusing on the ethnic diversity of people employed in film production.
Matt Damon challenged the African-American producer Effy Brown, stating behind the scenes that the ethnic composition should not be taken into account.
During the Sunday release of Project Greenlight on HBO, a well-known actor beat Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative views on the main black heroin selected for the draft scenario.
"Many things are appropriate when you're doing casting for the film itself, not for the show," said Damon.
Disgraceful Brown, without believing her ears, insulted "Wow! Nothing. Well" all the while an actor from Martianina gave comments in live air.
Ben Affleck and Farelli brothers joined in discussing the finalists of the show to Damon and Brown.
"I would like the participants - no matter who will be the director - to think about the treatise of the image of Harmony they are going to follow," said Brown at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute beaten by a white pimp.
The film producer Dear White People advocated that Leo Angelos and Kristen Branccio become film directors; Damon was very opposed, saying that "we can ultimately get the wrong things we want".
After this discussion was shown on television, social networks exploded with disapproval comments to Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the video: “Explanation of diversity from Matt Daemon to the only black man in the room THAT BELOE, which is so painful”.
Tweet scored over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 lycs.
Damon's statements are just when the literate coverage of the racial theme in the media is the most pressing issue on the agenda of the public debate.
After Michael Brown was shot by a police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement became popular throughout the country, urging legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the colourful population.
In February, Prince mentioned this movement at the time of the nomination of candidates at the "Albom of the Year" ceremony of Grammy Awards.
"The albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
Most recently, Black Lives Butter leaders issued a formal statement in response to a question by Fox News employee Elizabeth Hasselbeck on whether the group would be considered a group of haters.
"Black Lives Matter is a group of love," the leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon had been included in the list of business showers, producers and Magnate media invited with a visit to Pope Rome to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unknown whether the actor accepted the invitation and met with Papa.
"American Ninja Warrior" wins the first champion
The professional scalpel and associate officer Isaac Caldero became the first winner of the American Ninja Warrior show on Monday night, taking home a $1 million prize.
On this sports show, the 7th season, which has just ended, none of the participants have been able to go through all stages of the road with obstacles.
In the finals of the season, two participants, Caldero and operator Jeff Britten, made their way to the final round.
The final task included a 75 - foot - long rope lift in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to perform the task and worked out in time, becoming the first American Ninja Warrior athlete in the history of the frenzy phase 4, but Caldero did the task for three seconds faster, which made him a winner.
After winning with incredible labor, Caldero, who was shocked by what he had won a million dollars, gave an interview "E!News".
"I can't believe I've never made more money or lived more than $10,000 a year," said Isaac to journalists E! such a serious leap in his income.
And all of a sudden, I've never even imagined what this is like... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Wied met with the journalists The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the finals and why Britten, who first passed the route, would not receive any cash prize.
According to the rules, the fastest participant gets the money.
"If the finals are more than one, the prize is the fastest of them," said Wied.
Although the money is a wonderful reward and a life - changing one, it still has great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels insulted about it.
He's happy what he did.
He received tons of excited feedback from the fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "if I was destined to lose someone, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if we had changed roles.
The show "Americana Ninja Warrior" will be back with the eighth season, which will begin to take off in the spring of 2016.
Detective Tigers is quietly bypassing Minnesota Twins.
The second half of the season wasn't particularly fun for Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, Tigers is now taking last place in the Central Division of the American League.
Trying to be a nuisance, Tigers with a flash won Minnesota Twins on Tuesday with a 5-4 mark on the Targette-field.
Twins missed a half-game chance of cutting back from Houston Astros and taking second place in the Playoffs by the number of points after the winners.
For the Detroits, even for one night, it was the return of the word to the letter F, which slipped from them most of the second half of the season.
"Everything wins is fun, no matter how they get," said Tigers Manager Brad Osmus.
Pitcher Tigers Alfredo Simon made his contribution to supporting attacks, resulting in Detroit scored three points in the first two innings, and then added one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pitcher in 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
It was just his third high-quality launch in nine exits.
"I just want to end the year with good figures," said Simon.
I can't throw a pitcher at every game, so I want to get deeper into the game.
The designated Tigers reflector, Victor Martinez, was able to strike three strokes and scored two wounds -- the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three strokes since four hits in the game against Seattle Mariners on July 6th.
"He worked well with the beat," said Osmus.
He showed himself well in (the quality of a batter) and was significantly better at the work of the beat, and he maintained that quality for the game.
Took three shots in the second half of the seventh inning, the Twins got their best shot back in the game.
Central host Byron Baxter opened an inning on the left-hand side of the field.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks took over the first base, and the second baseman Brian Dozier got a strike-out on Simon's swing before his seat was taken by a left-wing Blaine Hardy.
Hardy bypassed Moera, the only player on the road before Miguel Sano's newly appointed reflector, who beat the two-lane single to the left of the right-wing Drew Verhagen.
With a couple of earlyners not in a car and a match-up wound at the second base of Verhagen, the third basman, Trevor Pluff, was able to lead him into a dabl loop.
It was the 27th time for the top league player this season when Pluff beat the double-play ball.
After Detroit added the insurgent wound to the first half of the ninth inning, Moer earned the RBI "dable" in space between the outsiders against the closing pitcher "Tigers" Bruce Rondon, and the bill became 5-4.
However, the right-wing player beat Sano after three strikes and got his fifth session.
Detroit took advantage of the temporarily unpracticed Phil Hughes at the beginning of the game.
Tigers earned three wounds in the first two innings against a well-deserved pitcher, which was on the list of traumatized to the game itself, missing more than a month in connection with a lunar flare.
"It's definitely not the start I'd like to start," said Hughes, "but as the game progressed, I started to feel more comfortable and so I was able to do a few pretty good shots in the third inning."
After the first battery reached the first base, Hughes dumped the single to the second baseball player, Ian Kinsler.
An eye in two raids of the G.D. Martínez raided Victor Martínez, who made a single in the middle for the first wound in the game.
Victor Martinez finished his series "0 for 21" with the early men in a successful position.
The player of the third base, Nick Castellanos, followed by "single", brought another wound, but Victor Martinez was beaten in an attempt to approach the third base, thereby eliminating the threat.
Tigers increased the second inning bill by receiving a single-car double-dable from the cather James McCann and a two-car single of the central-reflecting Anthony Goose, and it became 3-0.
"That was a powerful hit," said the manager, "Twins," Paul Molator.
He wasn't very good, but he got right to the right point.
Hewes, whose brooches were considered to have been placed in a third inning without a match, after which he was replaced by the right-wing relier A.J. Ahter.
Heuza was countin' three wounds for six hits and a four-wheel strike.
NOTE: Pitcher right-wing Tigers Anibal Sanchez left the players for stretching his right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed Sanchez' shoulder surgery in 2007.
For Sanchez, which has been on the injured list since mid-August, it is scheduled to start on Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez the pitcher-leaf Daniel Norris will leave the list of traumatized and go against the Twins.
Norris, who went out with Tigers at four starting points since his acquisition in exchange for the pitcher, David Price, on 30 July, had one victory and one defeat.
He has not participated in the games since 20 August due to the stretch of the muscle.
Tigers and Twins will finish a three-game series on "Target-field" on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will play pitcher-right Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
Kadirov's original complaint on the book "Milba to God" was brought to the South-Sahalin Court.
The South-Sahalin City Court received an original appeal from the representative of Chechnya President Ramzan Kadyrov in a decision to recognize the “extremist material” of the book “Molba to God: Its Meaning and Place in Islam”, Interfax, referring to the President of the Khuhray.
The court is now awaiting possible objections from the parties to the trial.
The rat refused to comment on the statements made by some members of the Government of the Russian Federation regarding the need to check the passageways for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence services and ISIS.
"Try to comment on such nonsense yourself," he said.
On 11 September, the South-Sahali City Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against Judge Natali Perchenko's decision to recognize the book “extremist material”.
An appeal was received from South-Sahalinska Prosecutor's Office on Friday evening.
There are nuances: in the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, they believe that they have asked the court to accept the author ' s opinion of the book as extremist, rather than that of the Koran.
In the opinion of the Prosecutor's Office, the judge made the wrong decision," said Chuhrai.
The decision to recognize the book “extremist material” was taken on 12 August 2015.
In particular, “extremists” were called the quotations from the Quran, “We worship you and ask you for help”, “Do not call anyone with Allah.”
Kadyrov called the decision-makers on the book "the Shaitans and the Provocators".
His delegation had called for a legislative ban on judicial decisions relating to the texts of sacred writings.
“I firmly believe that the Word must pass a law that prohibits the taking of decisions in court concerning the texts of the Koran and other Divine Scriptures directly”, Kadyrov wrote in his Instagram.
Facebook will delete comments insulting migrants and refugees
Facebook staff intend to remove posts and comments that negatively assess migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect complaints from users about unlawful content.
It is with the German Ministry of Justice to combat the manifestations of xenophobia and racism on the Facebook network.
Thus, on the eve of the head of the Haiko Maas department, he stated that the Minust is currently working with socialists to create a special moderator group.
Its participants have an obligation to monitor and remove incorrect comments against migrants and refugees.
According to Heiko Maas, it is assumed that the authors of the non-tolerant posts will receive notifications indicating the reasons for the removal of their records.
The organizations whose expertise is involved in collecting complaints from the users of social complaints about offensive posts should also facilitate the prompt blocking of the illegal content.
The Facebook manager intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative comments on migrants and refugees, the social network and the Ministry of Justice of Germany was taken after the rise of xenophobic sentiments in the German Faisbuk segment.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migration crisis, which spanned the countries of the European Union some time ago.
In Germany, for example, all points intended to accommodate refugees have already been overcrowded today.
On the eve of the country, the authorities decided to temporarily settle migrants in the territory of the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Forced settlers from the Middle East and Africa are placed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
There will be areas for relaxation in Moscow cemetery.
In the near future, several capital cemeteries are equipped with specialized relaxation and psychological recreation areas.
One of the first will be the Butovsky, Domodovsky, and the Šerbin cemetery.
The first psychological recreation area has already appeared in the Troekur cemetery in Moscow.
Such sites will continue to occur in other parts of the city.
This portal, m24.ru, was presented to Artem Ekimov, who is the head of the State Budget Institute, Ritual.
Relaxation zones will represent small green areas that resemble parks.
Experts believe that in these “coals” visitors to the cemetery will be able to rest, spend time with one another and restore psychological strength.
In the near future, relaxation zones will be built in the Domodedovsky, Butovsky and Šerbin cemetery and then in other parts of the capital.
According to the GBU chapter "Ritual", if there is a need to expand the cemetery area, the builders will try to preserve existing forest masses to the maximum extent possible.
Green plantings will serve as a live dam that will divide the rest zones and areas directly located under burial sites.
The experts of GBU, Ritual, also announced their intention to propose a waiver of the graveyards.
The new cemeteries can indeed be barbarous.
In addition, in GBU, Ritual reported a willingness to install electronic terminals to enable cemetery visitors to know GPS coordinates and burial plates.
In June of this year, the RITual GBU also proposed to adjust the cost of burial services, depending on the time of the year.
So the creek of the graves in summer time will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, a week in winter, when the earth is frozen.
In the past year, the cost of all forms of ritual services has been on average 10 per cent.
Five days later, a stray mushroom was found in the deer forests.
An elderly man was alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without a supply.
It was possible to discover a mountain crest through the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "The 79-year-old pensioner from the Tambov district spent five days in the woods."
No food or water.
He was wanted by relatives, saviors, volunteers.
There were even kyrologians with dogs, but there was no result.
The man was able to discover after a helicopter had joined the search engine.
On that day, Vitaly Alexandrovich usually went to the woods for opiates and cemeteries, but he didn't come back by tonight.
The relatives immediately sought help, and on the next day, rescue workers and indifferent residents from the neighboring village — about 30 people — were picked up to search for a mushroom.
A fire and rescue centre helicopter joined them for five days.
Andrey Seletkov, head of the search and rescue team of the Smolen Fire and Rescue Centre, said, "The Vertolet has been drawn, the man has been found."
He's gone very far, quite somewhere else.
It was about 12 km from the search site.
He's gone a long way back at his age.
It's a miracle he's still alive.
The mushroom was brought to the Hellenic central district hospital without consciousness, in a very difficult condition.
Medical experts diagnosed pneumonia as well as severe dehydration and rehydration of the body.
As an elderly man could stay alive after five days in the woods, doctors do not know at all.
Valentina Napsha, the head of the Hellenic Cemetery Therapy Department: "The patient has been examined, the treatment has been prescribed."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Given all his chronic diseases.
The patient’s condition improved in the morning, and it remained difficult, but with positive dynamics.
Vitali Alexandrovic, a pensioner, comes to Smolenstina from Tambov district each year.
His grandson says Grandpa used to go out and pick mushrooms, but he never went far into the woods.
Alexei Spitchenko, grandson of the found mushroom, said, "Les not far from the road, not local in principle."
For just a few years, he came to visit, visit his relatives.
Well, he went after the mushrooms.
Looks like he's gone far and lost his mind.
With the start of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all regions of Smolen district.
Five similar cases in the last few days alone.
Saviours remind us: We must walk into the forest in bright clothes, with a small supply of food, matches, and compasses.
In addition, it is desirable to leave behind traces so that you can then go back.
Emergency An-2 sat on the precipice in the fraternal taiga.
In the middle of a village in Siberia, emergency An-2.
Enisei, a red-wing aircraft, has landed 68 kilometres from Bratsk.
There were no casualties and no casualties, but the plane itself suffered significant damage on the ground.
An-2 was on a business trip.
There were three crew members on board, the commander, the second pilot and the barmechanist, reports Interfax.
The aircraft carried out a flight on the route of Železnovski-Ilimsk-Achinsk, where the airline was based.
The crew is already on their way to Bratsk.
After the An-2 emergency landing, the Brat Transport Prosecutor ' s Office began to verify compliance with air safety legislation.
An investigation team from the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor ' s Office went to the scene.
In September 2010, Tu-154 crew set up its aircraft with passengers due to a technical malfunction at an airfield in Komi.
Engines and onboard electronics were denied on the liner, but the crew did not make it possible.
On board the plane were 10 crew members and 72 passengers.
No one was injured in an emergency landing.
The news of the Economy: Globalization: Nobel Laureate
The processes of globalization should have contributed to reducing inequalities in the world.
In fact, the situation is different, and the income gap in developing economies is on the rise.
Eric Masskin.
In order to remedy this, it is necessary to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers, according to the Chief Research Officer of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Decisions of NITU WSE, Nobel Prize laureate for the Economy of 2007 by Eric Masskin.
Over the past 20 years, the world has experienced an unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
The participants in globalization predicted great benefits for the developing economies.
“And these forecasts have come true in many ways”, said Maskin.
For example, China and India have experienced a significant growth in per capita GDP.
But it's not that happy.
Globalization was expected to reduce the gap between the “poor” and the “poor” in poor countries, which is reflected in a large inequality of income and, more specifically, wages.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article “Why Global Markets Have Not Reduced Inequity in Developing Economies, ” published in The World Bank Economic Review, which has been translated and quoted by INE.
Together with the economist, Professor of Harvard University, Michael Cremer Eric Maskin, developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why income differences in poor countries are increasing as globalization grows, reminds NIE YET.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
To demonstrate them, Maskin has provided four levels of expertise - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, professionals D from poor countries lack the qualifications to cooperate with specialists A and B from rich countries.
And if the C-level workers from poor countries have increased their wages by cooperating with B-persons from the rich, D-growth workers do not feel or their salaries are falling.
The outcome is that internationalization of production will increase the wage gap between the two professional categories in poor countries and thus increase inequality.
Cremer and E. Maskin offered an amazingly beautiful model, an alternative ricardian theory of comparative advantages.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fuad Alesskerov, a resident professor who runs the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Decisions, head of the Department of Mathematics of the NITU U.S.A.
And as any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to empirical work in this area.
The solution, according to Eric Maskin, is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
According to the scientist, however, the workers themselves do not have the means to do so, and it is not advantageous for companies to pay their training.
Governments, international agencies, NCAs and private funds can play a significant role in this situation.
The scientist notes that the theory developed in no way calls for the halting of globalization, which has produced and produced results in the growth of GDP in countries.
Derbent: Living Time Link.
Derbent, one of Russia's oldest cities, notes his 2000s in September.
In the programme of celebrations, the festival of national cultures of the people of Dagestan and the fair in the style of past times, the exhibition of derbent carpets and the Open Temple Day, the historical and musical show "2000 years in two hours" and a tour of the reconstructed museum of Petr I.
The medieval stones of Narin-Kala fortress, the old Arab inscriptions on the walls, narrow alleys and palace gardens, all of which came down from the pages of "Tissians and One Night".
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has been in place since ancient times.
Although claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Hazar Khanate, and the Golden Horde.
The age of eastern platinums growing in the courtyard of Derbent Juma Mechete equals several centuries.
These powerful plants are protected by the “The Trees of Nature” All-Russian programme.
The shadow of scattered crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
Visitors to the Mosque enjoy the flavoring of tea and enjoy the dagastan treats with honey, darm, muslim, luscious, luscious, irana and sweet.
In Derbent, centuries of suffering are used by large samovars to drink tea with many guests at one time.
The inscription on the entrance to Juma Bear says the building was built in 115 hijers.
That is, in 733, for the Gregorian calendar.
It's the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is striking with scale and solemnity: the arcades of dome and assemblies are based on square columns and are covered by the rays of the sun from the tiny windows.
The content and distribution of pigeons is the traditional involvement of the people of Derbent.
Bird owners put pigeons in the courtyards, under trees, in the attics.
The exciting sight is that a white dove room, like a holiday fireworks flare, is blown up into the sky.
To defend the enemy, the ancient Persians blocked the Caspian Gates with a double stone wall.
Moving 500 meters into the sea, this facility shuts Derbent's harbor.
In 2003, the Derbent Walls were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the most well-maintained monument of ancient Persian fortification.
The carpets in Derbent were still running in the fifth century, and until now the technology of this unique trade has remained almost unchanged.
In one of the streets adjacent to the city market, carpets are sold for any taste - bar belts of wool, cotton or wool of all colours and shades, with or without wool, with a complex ornament and a lovely coffee.
The construction of the city began with donkeys - blocks with one-storey stone structures.
In many years, donkeys have not changed much.
Only satellite dishes, air - conditioners on the walls, and street lamps remind us that you are not in the medieval city, but in the modern city.
In the old part of the city, the plumbing was preserved about a thousand years ago.
To date, ancient sources of water have reached locals today.
Many derbents prefer regular tap water from proven historical fountains.
In Derbent there was one of the centers of the racing craft.
The bowls, the bowls, the cupboards, were appreciated by all the Caucasians.
The hands of the potter are still producing excellent ceramic products, both for practical purposes and for souvenir purposes.
On holidays and festivals, crowds of spectators gather under a tight rope at which students of the Republican School of Circus Arts speak.
The history of amazing and risky crafts is centuries old.
The new trend is that girls are more and more likely to be seen among Canadians.
A museum called Culture and Ancient Derbent is working at the former Virgin Bath.
Previously, there were single girls and bridesmaids who accompanied their friends, and now anyone who wanted to see a pool room, a hot and cold pool that had gone into the past bathing suits.
Most of Derbent’s houses have hot water, but the baths and steamers are now as popular as they were in old times.
The benefits of warming the body with steam are described in the old books.
After the bath, the blood improves, the muscles lose their fatigue, and the body acquires flexibility and ease of speech.
The Commonwealth Festival, which takes place in Narin-Kala Fortress, is attended by ethnos of many districts of Dagestan.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk tunes, perform songs of the people of the Caucasus and entertain visitors with delicious homemade cheese.
It is the burial place of forty martyrs who have put their heads behind Islam.
This is one of the most respected complexes for Northern Caucasus Muslims.
The coveted sarcophagus have been cut off from the target stone blocks and are oriented, as Arabs have assumed, on the axis of the west-east.
Brothers Gavriel and Albert Jacob's stripper and recruiting customers in a small salon near the Upper Marketer.
Parikmacherska has been in this area for many years.
Receipts of a circular trade are passed from generation to generation.
At the same time, Jacob’s brothers can make not only traditional but also the most modern hairstyle.
There was a house on one of the streets of the Old Town where Alexander Bestuzev-Marlinsky, a writer-dekabrist lived on the Caucasus.
After learning the Turkic language and collecting the ethnographic material, he described Derbent of the first third of the 19th century with his ancient monuments, life, and hometowns.
Chaihana is a traditional club in the East, where only tea and homemade toast are served.
Men come here to get thirsty, to hang out with friends and solve some work problems.
As in the past, women are not recommended to cross the Chaihan threshold.
The Derbent dance band Caspiya was established three years ago, but has already participated in activities at the republican and Russian levels.
The band's soloists rehearse every day by squandering folk adventures, Darwinian, Tatian, Armenian dances.
As the evening comes, when noises and street lights are lit, locals sit on benches near houses with terraces in motion.
Derbents usually discuss domestic issues.
But in advance of the anniversary, they are increasingly reminiscing about the unique history of their city, which has influenced the fate of the entire Black Sea-Cappie region.
There was a business "game at the airport" in Domodedov.
The capital has a new form of learning.
Four hundred students tried to serve as airport staff.
For this purpose, models of three aircraft fires were mounted in Domodedov.
Not only did young people inspect and record passengers but they also served planes.
All of this is in the form of a business game, but it was difficult for her to give in to reality.
The late flights, the two passengers with the fractures on board, got lost somewhere on the road to the plane.
Hell is for this airport.
For the one who settled in the Angara of Domodov, a standard set of tasks to be completed by the newcomers.
Three large airports from different parts of the world were immediately housed in one hangar.
Today, there are four hundred students from capital colleges and universities.
An unprecedented opportunity to know all about the internal world of air travel.
Passenger registration, aircraft maintenance, baggage traffic, even buses on the flight field, benches and passenger inspection.
And passengers are all troubled.
One mess of documents, the other late for the flight, the third filled the bag with suspicious items.
And you need to deal with it, as in life, within a minimum period of time.
For each of these tasks, they are charged a certain amount, virtual money, as if they had been paid by the airline for maintenance of the flight.
“They are fined for failure to perform the relevant tasks”, explains in the interview of the news-Moscow programme financial analyst Dmitry Hilko.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely following the situation.
For them, this exam is an attempt to test a new form of learning.
She has already been enrolled in secondary vocational education.
“Six interregional competence centres will be established, which will become, in fact, new models for modern colleges with modern management systems, highly skilled staff, with modern equipment”, says the Director of State Policy in the area of training workers and additional professional education of the Russian Minobrnauki Natalya Zolotarev.
But to students, not to global plans.
After three days of training, they'll probably need a weekend.
However, the assessment for this examination was quite substantive.
The new smart eyes, the best I've ever seen!
"I received them for having responded in a timely manner to our Instagram Airport claim," said Sergei Shuvalov, a pleased player, the Pear Manager of the Airport Frankfurt team.
The best judges, as it is called, were taken to quarantine to invite them to work by the time they completed their studies.
The US Embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia regretted the closure of the foreign literature of the American Center Library.
The Centre worked in Moscow for over 22 years.
The US Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian Government to close the US Embassy American Center at the M.I.Rudomino State Library in Moscow.
“The unilateral steps taken by the Russian Government recently call into question the commitment of the Russian Government to the ties between the Russian and American peoples, which did not break even during the cold war and in other difficult moments of the long history of our countries’ relations”, said Ambassador John Tefft of the United States, who had entered the Interfax.
The American Centre has created deep and lasting links between the people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the centre of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital and served as the venue for meetings with many American eminent figures, including cosmonauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
“Only last year has the American Centre carried out over 400 cultural and educational activities and accepted over 50,000 Russian visitors,” emphasized the diplomat.
Teft recalled that about a year ago, it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project, the FLEX Education Exchange Programme (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Tribunal has been quick to prosecute.
Typical situation: four officials are standing at the table of Judge Swatter Kumar, listening to his claims for work done.
The Court is completely dissatisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn't give you a 110-page order to make him happy, said Kumar.
If there's one more brick, we'll have all the existing structures destroyed.
Kumar is headed by the National Green Tribunal (NZT), a judicial authority established in 2010 to stop the rapid pollution of the environment, accompanied by a violent economic increase in recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal has been able to consider more than 10,000 claims related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two of three cases, the court decides to stop pollution-related construction.
Rates are incredibly high: India has become one of the world's most overcrowded and polluted virgin jungles in under 60 years since the declaration of independence of increased industrial development.
The problem is particularly acute in large megapolises, where infrastructure development does not succeed in rapid urbanization: cities covered with solid capacity, rivers filled with pesticides and wastes from enterprises and households, and few remaining housing units are being built into new residential neighborhoods.
Despite formal support for the green movement by the State, NZT is regularly criticized by the Government of Narendra Modi, as it is often the main cause of the cancellation of major investment projects.
In May of this year, the Minister of the Environment called the decisions of the court “extremal” and “inapplicable”.
Sometimes the court's decisions cannot be met within the court's time frame, confirms environmental counsel Raj Panjvani.
However, unfulfilled dedlineation is also positive: at least they force responsible persons to move.
"His main goal is to shake this system," added the lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has repeatedly abolished large constructions: it is responsible for halting the construction of the airport, power plants and hundreds of smaller facilities.
People are also trying to remember, for example, during the discussion of the fate of a pharmaceutical company in Telagnan State, which polluted the local fluoride river.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People lose their jobs," Kumar commented on his decision.
However, such explanations are not always understood by ordinary people whose lives can be changed by a single rosary.
Thus, in April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles over 10 years from entering the capital, as a result of public outrage.
Despite the dramatic decline in popularity and criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to rescind the decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics from the Government of Delhi on an entry and exit vehicle, and offered to purchase 10,000 additional buses, knowing previously at factories whether they were able to carry out such an order.
As pollution sources such as landfills, fuel quality, and even road accidents began to subside the court’s attention, the people’s anger began to subside.
But the most painful subject of the judge of principle was the Ganga River Cleaner programme, which was launched by Prime Minister Narendro Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges — sacred to Hindus of the river — the judge often ceases to contain his emotions and to cry out.
Do you know what "holy" means?
Someone poured water out of the Ganges on a statue of God, and there was a fece in it, and a judge was hot.
You continue to pollute the river because you think Gang is Gang, he will take away all our sins.
It is the river that we worship, and see what you do to it every day.
The cleansing of the Ganga is the most ambitious and costly environmental project that the new Government has announced.
At present, the number of faeces in this river exceeds 120 times the standard.
Each year between 1.5 million and 3 million Hindus bathed in it die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narndra Modi even donated money to the Gang Rescue Fund from selling his suit, where he met Barak Obama and another 455 items from his personal collection.
Ecologists also accused the Prime Minister of populism: the costume was bought for $700,000, while the river needed at least eight billion to clean up.
The supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India will have a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but do not believe that environmental progress should be valuable.
“In a developing country, environmental discussions are often perceived as unacceptable luxury,” says Zov Ganga activist Malik Bhanot.
The court tries to find a gold between environment and development.”
The man bled some images of Dali at the exhibition in Riga.
A visitor to the Latvian Artist's Union exhibition in Riga broke windows in the museum and ruined El Salvador Daly's "Establishment of an Angel" sculpture.
The museum now features an exhibition of El Salvador’s works, Dali and Pablo Picasso.

He immediately led the wrong way: he ruined the sculpture, broke the windows.
He then began moving around the premises and tainted several works of permanent exposure with blood.
Among them is a portrait of Poruka the bones of Miervaldis Polisa.
According to the President of the Latvian Artist's Union, Igor Dobachin, referred to by Interfax, also damaged the windows.
Police and artistic experts work at the scene of the incident.
The latter determine the extent of the damage and damage.
A criminal case of bullying has been brought against a man.
From 4 August to 27 September, the Latvian Artist's Union exhibits Picasso and Dali, which represents more than 200 original works by artists.

Where can I leave a comment about the Murmansk courthouse?
In the Office of the Federal Court Services for the Murman Region, it was reported that there was a book of feedback and proposals in the department to improve the protection of the rights and legitimate interests of citizens and organizations.

CJingpin calls for making the economy more open to peace
The economy must become more open to the world in order to boost its growth, as President CJingpin said on Tuesday in addressing the reform leadership group.
“China should concentrate on attracting foreign investors and experts and developing an open policy”, he said, addressing the 16th meeting of the Central Lead Group on the comprehensive deepening of reforms.
He said that broadening openness and deepening reforms would give the economy new impetus and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The Steering Group adopted a number of directives, including regulation of market access for investors, modification of border control rules, promotion of public enterprises (SOEs), attracting private capital and revision of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be phased out through pilot programmes.
This is an important step because it will provide the market with a more meaningful role in resource allocation, business legitimacy and openness, as stated in the statement.
The Government will also weaken the control over the powers conferred on the companies by guaranteeing that companies themselves will run their own business.
The statement also states that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to enhance local growth.
Even more will be available to private investors in order to increase the openness of State-controlled sectors of the economy.
“The government will not change its foreign investors policy and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign finance companies and provide them with better conditions”, the statement said.
It will further facilitate the application for permanent residence for foreigners, or Green Card, by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the application process itself.
The meeting also discussed the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report issued after the meeting, it was also attended by Prime Minister Lee Katshan and Ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli.
