Bosnians protest Croatia's plans for the landfill of radioactive waste
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in northwestern Bosnia to protest Croatia's plans to store part of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near the border with Bosnia and the main river known for its natural beauty.
Demonstrators in the Bosnian city of Novi Grad demanded Croatia to reject plans to build a landfill of waste in former military barracks in the town of Trgovska Gora and declared a fight against the project.
The facility would store waste from the Krško nuclear power plant.
Bosnians, holding banners with the words "I want a healthy future" and "Stop – (the river) Una needs us", said that the storage of radioactive waste could endanger the Union's rivers and the lives of about 250,000 inhabitants.
We have to say no.
told the crowd Miroslav Drljaca, mayor of the municipality of Nova Grad.
We must fight to protect our way of life and our Una.
Located in Slovenia, Krško power plant built in the 1980s belongs also to Croatia.
The representatives of both countries are due to meet next week to discuss additional landfills.
Croatian public TV HRT reported on Friday that Croatia has not yet decided whether the waste warehouse should be built on its own or pay for the storage of parts of the waste in a new facility designed by Slovenia.
Croatian Minister of Environment and Energy Tomislav Coric told reporters that Croatia also has a problem with the treatment of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons and hopes to find a comprehensive solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents from any part of the country that exists in the ethnic division insist that Croatia find another location in the part of the country nearest to the power plant.
"Why Croatia across its area claims that it is the best place in Bosnia?" he asked Drljaca.
We can't let them down!

US Congress agreed to sell Poland 32 F-35 aircraft
The U.S. Congress, by law, 15 days after the approval by the Department of State of the possible purchase by Poland of 32 F-35 multitaskers, has not objected to this transaction, which means that the last condition was met before the start of the purchase negotiations.
The decision of the Congress, although not unexpected, is of great political importance.
"After approval of the sale by the State Department, and now by Congress, I see no more serious obstacles," said John V. Venable, Senior Counsellor for the Defense Policy of Washington, a conservative think tank Heritage Foundation.
The expert explained that, under the Arms Export Control Act 1976, the Federal Government, represented by the State Department, must notify Congress of any planned sale of arms abroad 15 days before the signing of the contract, if the value of such a transaction, in the case of the sale of arms to a NATO Member State, exceeds 50 million dollars.
The proposed purchase of 32 F-35 fighters by Poland is estimated at $6.5 billion. This amount includes technical and logistical assistance, auxiliary equipment and pilot training.
The main supplier of F-35 aircraft – if this transaction is finally finalised - will be the US arms company Lockheed Martin, and its subcontractor is the engine manufacturer for F-35A fighter company Pratt and Whitney.
Proposals for the purchase of US fighters of the fifth generation F-35 on behalf of the Polish authorities were made in May by the Minister of Defence Mariusz Błaštzak.
The Polish offer was discussed in June of this year during the meeting of President Andrzej Dudy with President Donald Trump in the White House.
The implementation of this agreement, if finalised, will be supervised by representatives of the Pentagon under the Foreign Militar Sales Programme (FMS).
As part of the FMS programme, Poland has already acquired, among other things, the Patriot missile system.
The price of one F-35 fighter at the time of Poland’s offer of purchase was – without arms and technical assistance – around 89.2 million dollars.
As the PAP told the American military experts who wanted to remain anonymous, such a price in the initial negotiations was "the maximum price, much higher than the price to be negotiated".
"The prices are falling rapidly, the price of one F-35 is now below 80 million dollars, much less than the cost of Eurofighter, which has no F-35 advantages," Venable said.
PAP speakers expressed the hope that the final negotiations on transactions for the purchase by Poland of US warplanes would end this year.
The possible participation of Polish subcontractors in this transaction – offset – will be discussed directly with US producers of F-35 fighters.
What is Münchausen's replacement band, referred to in the series "Payton Hobart's Choices" on the Netflix platform?
The guardians and parents with the above disorder pretend that their healthy child is sick.
The series "Payton Hobart Elections" will be on the Netflix platform today.
He tells the story of Payton Hobart, who wants to be President of the United States of America, but first he must be president of the student council in his secondary school.
In the series "American horror Story" and "Glee", we will see Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Platta and Lucy Boyton.
Not revealing too many details for those who have not yet had the opportunity to see the series, he deals with the theme of the replacement group of Munchhausen, a mental illness of caregivers who act as if a healthy person who is affected by physical or mental illness.
There are various types of this disorder, such as the Munchhausen syndrome, which is associated with the symptoms of the disease.
The replacement Munchhausen team consists of simulating that the person under our care has some problems.
It is also called an inventive and congenital disease, and is treated as violence against the child.
This is a rare condition that usually involves a parent who is exhilarating or causing symptoms, so that the child is sick.
What are the symptoms of Munchhausen's replacement team?
The symptoms of this disease may vary, but NHS points out the following examples of behaviour:
Convincing medical personnel that a child who looks healthy, however, feels ill.
Exaggeration or invention of symptoms.
Falsification of the results to make the baby sick, e.g. administration of glucose to urine samples to make it look like the baby has diabetes.
Inducing symptoms of disease, e.g. by giving children unnecessary medicines and other substances.
How often does the replacement Munchhausen syndrome occur?
It is difficult to estimate how often this disorder occurs, as many cases of disease are not reported.
A study published in 2000 showed that there were 89 cases in more than two years of this disorder per 100,000 people.
What should be done if there are suspicions that a child may be in danger?
Contact the local department of special services or call the NSPCC child protection information office by selecting number 0808 800 5000.

He claimed that the children were studying the Koran and nothing else.

‘They were kept in dehumanizing conditions on behalf of the submission or acquisition of crown knowledge.
Many of them had scars on their backs, proving that they were beaten.
That is why we are studying the school to meet its owner," he added.

Simeoniak: Tusk or Kidawa-Blonska will be president
"I believe that Donald Tusk and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska have a chance to win the election with President Andrzej Duda," said Tomasz Siemoniak.
Vice-President of the Citizens' Platform Tomasz Siemoniak, speaking with Polsat News, talked about an affair with the head of NIK.
"This case is disqualifying to Marian Banas.
He can be the Minister of Culture from some sort of entertainment, not the head of NIK, or the Minister of Finance.
Not someone responsible for billions of taxes," he said.
"This case is a very serious state crisis," he added.
He also spoke of Claudius Jahira's candidate.
"The PiS lists Antoni Macierewicz.
A man who didn't just say things, just did them.
He judged former SCW leaders for spying on Russia, destroyed their lives, destroyed their families.
Why doesn't anyone call for Anthony Macierevic not to be on the list?", he asked.
"Young people from us have different aesthetics.
I think that Jahira, who has already apologized for one of these things, feels that she sometimes exaggerates.
Let's not make this a campaign problem," he added.

"Abominable" masked rapist of Central Coast children forced to look at his victim in court
Dressed in a masked man grabbed a 12-year-old girl in school from behind and dragged her into dense plants in Central Coast in May 2017.
Then he tied her to a tree and raped her.
Shortly after the arrest, a search warrant was carried out in his home, where officers detained a number of essential items for the investigation.
The man pleaded guilty to seven assault-related charges and to three more concerning the seduction and use of another girl, aged 11 years, between August 2016 and August 2017.
A 12-year-old victim walked along the path, and when she looked behind her, she saw him suddenly come out of the bushes armed with a large branch and a knife.
When she begged “stop, stop, stop, ” he grabbed her by the neck and forced her to enter the plant.
The man said: “Silence, don’t shout.
Don't shout, or I'll have to hurt you."
Holding the knife in his right hand, he tied her hands and legs with cable belts, and then tied her to a tree and raped her for almost an hour.

The pope calls on the executive directors of technology companies to exploit artificial intelligence for the common good
On Friday, Pope Francis warned executive directors of technology companies, diplomats and financiers that the race to create artificial intelligence and other forms of achievement in the digital field entails a risk of increasing social inequalities if, in the course of its ethical process, the good in common is not taken into account.
Pope Francis uttered these words during a conference in the Vatican, attended by government envoys and representatives of Facebook and Google companies, as well as philosophers, physicists and ethics.
A small group of academics and bishops of the Catholic Church gathered participants at the conference entitled "The Common Good in the Digital Age".
This three-day event is the latest evidence that the Vatican is interested in participating in the debate on the prospects and risks of artificial intelligence.
Discussions were held on technological developments in martial arts and the future of work, in which machinery will play an increasingly important role, as well as the study of the Christchurch bombing case in New Zealand and decisions taken by social media owners in connection with the distribution of a movie recording massacre.
During his speech at the conference, Pope Francis praised the potential for technological progress, noting that machines at the beginning of the industrial revolution saved workers from dangerous and monotonous work.
However, he warned that increasingly addicting to work equipment to achieve profits is a risk of depriving people of the dignity that results from work.
"If technological progress became the cause of increasingly visible inequalities, this would not be real and real progress," he warned.
If the so-called technological advances of mankind were to become enemies of the good in common, it would lead to an unfavorable reinstatement of some kind of barbarism dictated by the laws of the strongest.
The organizers of the conference expressed the hope of drawing on the expertise of the participants and identifying possible future advisers of the Catholic Church in high-tech matters.

SERVANT Krzysztof Brejza challenges Caesar Gmyz
“As a result of the campaign of lies, TV is a lawsuit against Caesar Gmyz,” said Mr. Krzysztof Brejza on Twitter.
The reason for the complaint is the statement by the publicist Caesar Gmyz in the program “La 20” on TVP.
One of the leading leaders of SoakzBuraka is Krzysztof Brejza, who has great experience in organizing hate department.
"People who know Mariusz Kozaka-Zozdę – the founder of the "heiter" profile – is Kierwinski, Budka and Gierty", Gmyz said.
SokzBuraka is a social media website and profile with mems and policy jokes.
According to the "Networks", the PR-sheep Mariusz Kozak-Zozdava is behind the profile of this title.
"We were able to find out that since April Mariusz Kozak-Zozda has been employed in the city's Warsaw office, in the marketing office," he wrote a week.
"Confession" in Olava
At the trade fair in Olav, the election committee "Confederation" organized its meeting.
Their program was presented by Krzysztof Szokalski number 5 on the list, and Halszka Bieleck number 9.
The anonymous leader of the list Krzysztof Tuduj did not get to the point of election.
The candidates raised many problems – from excessive fiscalism to health problems.
The issue of the economic zone was also raised, which should work for all entrepreneurs rather than favour foreign capital.

Boris Johnson addressed to the police supervisor in connection with a close relationship with the businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri
An independent IOPC police department will examine the possibility of initiating an investigation into the prime minister of the investigation whether, during the course of his public office as mayor of London, he has been abused as a criminal offence.
The Grand Council of London (GLA) stated in its statement that its Supervisory Inspector had registered the “issue of the procedure” of the Prime Minister in connection with the charges of preferential treatment of Arcuri arising from their intimate relationship.
"The issue of the procedure can be referred to when there is information indicating the possibility of committing a crime," he said.
It doesn't mean it's proved in any way.
The IOPC will now consider whether it is necessary to investigate the matter.
The issue was addressed to the IOPC, which deals with complaints against members of the police services in England and Wales.
She was transferred to the Police Supervisory Authority, because Johnson was then responsible for the Police Commissioner and the Criminal Commissioner.
Johnson denied that his relationship with Arcuri had any kind of irregularity.
Earlier, he said that he would follow the London City Council's order and give details of his relations with Arcuri, but he insisted that the council "compils on the wrong problem".
The order is a consequence of the report by The Sunday Times that Arcuri, an American who moved to London seven years ago, received 126 000 pounds of budgetary money, and privileged access to three foreign trade missions, headed by Mayor Johnson.
As a result, the government froze a grant of £100,000 for the Arcuri company Hacker House until the case was considered.
The government is waiting for difficult questions about the verification procedure carried out prior to the allocation of funds.
Minister of Digitalisation Matt Warman said in the Chamber of the Gmin that the employees of his department "usually maintained due diligence" and that the company had a British telephone number.
However, according to numerous reports, links to the number have been redirected to the California office, where the 34-year-old Arcuri is now to live.
The close relationship of the Prime Minister with the businesswoman "was a mystery to the staff of the police.
The decision of the GLA to refer the prime minister to the independent IOPC police office was displeased at 10 Downing Street.
According to the source of the higher rank of the government representative, it is a "politically motivated attack" and its term, on the eve of the Conservative Party conference, is "publicly political".
"The Supervisory Inspector did not provide any evidence to confirm the charges, and the Prime Minister did not get a chance to reply to him before the press release was published late Friday evening," says the source.
Neither citizens nor the media will be able to get a political bill on such an obvious basis.
Today, in earlier hours, journalists "The Standard" were told that Johnson's close relationship with the businesswoman from California, assisted by the London Tourism and Promotion Agency, was a "polishinal mystery" for the workers.
The above-mentioned employees of London & Partners (L&P) pointed out that Arcuri had received seats during Johnson's foreign business trips as mayor, even though her companies were not considered as "faithful" at the time.
Third ever charged with drug crimes in connection with Mac Miller's death
LOS ANGELES (AP) – Due to the death of rapper Mac Miller last year as a result of drug overdose, a third man was arrested and charged with drug offences.
According to court documents, Stephen Walter is suspected of selling fake oxycodone-treated pills that Miller had in his possession before his death last September due to accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, a strong opioid responsible for “epidemia”, which consumed several thousand human beings in the United States.
Walter's accusing himself of delivering pills that another man, Cameron Petit, sold to Miller.
The court records sealed on Tuesday reveal that Petite received drugs from Walter throughout August.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havas City in Arizona, is suspected of being Walter's “curator” who supplied the pills to Petit.
None of these men were directly accused of causing Miller's death, nor did any of them present a line of defence in his case.
Walter is in custody under the 2005 drug parole and has already been sentenced to five months' imprisonment for breach of the terms of the exemption.
Prosecutors in charge of a case that was first reported on Thursday by a website dedicated to TMZ celebrities are demanding that Walter remain in custody pending trial, claiming that there is a serious risk of the accused's escape.
The reply to the message left on his lawyer's automatic secretary was not immediately received.
The defendant was charged with a federal court on 4 September, and his defense attorney refused to comment.
Miller's rhymed lyrics are a frank talk about his depression and drug use, making him gain fans from the biggest hip-hop stars.
From Pittsburgh Miller, who was truly named Malcolm James Myers McCormick, remained in connection with the singer Ariane Grande, who had been completed earlier in 2018.
After his death on Instagram, she published a moving film featuring Miller and the song “Thank U Next”, in which she spoke of him with love.
Miller is one of the musicians whose death has been linked to the abuse of opioids in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist of 3 Doors Down, also died from an overdose in 2016 and was diagnosed with fentanyl and hydrocodone in his body.
This article has amended: the correct writer Walter is "Stephen", not "Steven".
9-year-old Nigerian creates over 30 games for mobile devices
9-year-olds create a game like hide-and-seek with free Scratch 2 programming application.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations and stories online or offline.
So far, Basil has generated over 30 games for mobile devices.
In today's game there is a bat who hides according to the program.
The player gets a point every time he grabs a bat who comes out of the hideout.
I learned games on an accelerated course.
"Now I create them when I'm bored," Basil CNN said.
In March, Dad enrolled him in a five-day fast-track course for children between the ages of 5 and 15.
The course, organized by Codefest International, aimed at providing children such as Basil, access to new technologies, such as robotics and virtual reality.
The boy's father, Basil Okpara Senior, claims Basil played a lot of games on mobile devices.
“When he was 4 years old, I bought him pills because he always caught the phone and played it.
He played a lot in Candy Crush and Temple Run," CNN's father said.
But Basil's interest in creating games grew when he was 7 years old and got the bar to spend all the time playing games.
"One day he played on the tablet as usual, and was so absorbed that I got upset," his father said.
Out of anger, I said, “You just play, can’t you think about creating your own games so that others can play it? ”
In saying these words, I was upset and didn't think he'd take them seriously," he added.
From that time on, Basil showed an active interest in learning how to create his own games, influenced his parents to buy a laptop and write it on a course during which he learned the basis of playing.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, gives his thunder titles based on their content.
One of his games, Mosquito Mash, is available on Google play store.
Africa has the largest population of young people in the world and, like Basil, this population includes an innovation leadership on the continent.
Two Nigerian 12-year-olds have recently been famous for using codes to create robots separating their work at home.
In May, the Acrobot team from Ghani High School won the Robofest 2019 Competition for programming robots to frame boxes.
And thanks to the growing investment of giants in technology, such as Google and Microsoft, in Africa, Basil and his peers are on a good track to the career of encoding stars.
Former president of the Republican Party in North Carolina admits to lying about corruption
Friday's court documents show that the former president of the Republican Party in North Carolina admits in court that he lied to federal agents investigating corruption of the main political donor.
According to Robin Hayes, he's supposed to plead guilty next Wednesday.
According to a factual document drawn up in the framework of Hayes' defence agreement and signed by Lawyes, Hayes knew that he was making a false statement to the FBI agents investigating corruption in 2018.
The defence agreement has been sealed, and on the basis of the facts, it does not determine which of the charges Hayes will make.
Initially, he was accused of conspiracy, corruption, and false testimony.
Prosecutors accused former Congressman Hayes of participating in an insurance company's plan to direct taxes on a campaign to the main regulator of the insurance market in exchange for special treatment.
Director Greg Lindberg and his two associates were charged with attempting to bribe State Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey.
Lindberg is the founder of an insurance and investment firm, which has been one of the main political donors in recent years, which has transferred over $5 million from 2016 to national and federal candidates and committees.
He supported mainly the goals and policies of the Republican Party, but also passed on to the Democrats.
His lawyer did not respond to Friday's e-mail with a request for a comment.
Hayes Kearns Davis defender did not respond to Friday's e-mail with a request for a comment.
According to Friday's court papers, Hayes lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he wasn't talking to Causey about state insurance department employees.
In fact, according to the fact-based document, Hayes talked to the Insurance Commissioner about Lindberg's request for changes in staff employed by the market regulator.
The defendants claim that Hayes also helped Lindberg organize a meeting with Causey and that he was talking about the bribe directly with the regulator.
According to Lindberg's April indictment, he required special treatment for his insurance business and planned to transfer up to $2 million to the Causey campaign again in 2020.
It follows from the indictment that the contract also requires the amendment of the departmental officer who controlled Lindberg.
The Republican Causey reported allegedly attempted corruption against federal agents and helped them gather evidence on the case.
He wasn't charged with anything.
According to Lindberg's indictment, he ordered Hayes to hand over $250,000 to the Causey campaign during a conversation that Lindberg and Causey were also present.
During the conversation, Hayes initially protested, claiming that handing over such a amount of money would attract attention, but, according to the indictment, it eventually dropped.
"Whatever you all want to do, we'll do," Hayes said, according to the indictment.
"All right, I'll take care of it."
The Federal Attorney's Office did not reply to an e-mail asking for further information on the settlement.
Drivers will be the first to go with a new burying.
On Saturday, drivers will be able to use the first of the three built mountain sections of the S7 expressway, i.e. the new Zakopianka – from Skomiełny Biały to Rabka Source and further the two-way main road accelerated to Chabówka.
On Friday, Iwona Mikrut, the first of the three sections of the built S7 south of Krakow, from Ljubljana to Rabka Z source, which will be used, was reported by the spokesman of the General Directorate of National Roads and Motorways (GDDKiA) Iwona Mikrut.
With more than a six-kilometre stretch from Scommeal White to Chabowka, more than a third, i.e. approx.
2.3 km, it was led on wires.
Seventeen of them rose up, including the longest and highest, a mile long and 50 m high, and four small objects on the slopes of the Scomieln node.
From this, the nodes were led to conventions on Wadowice and New Socz, to national road No. 28 and to the old course DK7.
From the next node, Zabornia, you can get to DK47 in the direction of New Targ & Zakopane and on DK7 to Chyzhny and the border of the country with Slovakia.
There was a place to operate the ILO travellers on the Zbyecke Mountain.
The express road ends with the Zabornia node in Rabka Zdroju, to which was built about a mile-long two-way section of DK47 to Chabówka and there it was included in the already existing two-way Chabówka – Rzawka.
S7 Skomielna Skomielna Biała – Radka Source and new section of the national road No. 47 of the main accelerated class (GP) from Rabka Source to Chabówka was built by the Italian company Salini Impregilo from Milan.
The investment cost amounted to approximately PLN 615 million.
The quality assurance of the work done will be valid for 10 years.
The 16.7 km section of the new Zakopianka, including 15.8 km with express road parameters, was divided into three implementation sections, each with a separate contractor: Lubín – Repair, Repair – Skomelna Biała and Skomelna Biała – Rabka Source.
The first section to enter the tunnel is performed by the Polish – Ukrainian consortium of companies: IDS-BUD S.A. from Warsaw and ALTIS-HOLDING Corporation from Kiev, a tunnel section from Italy by the company Astaldi and the third by the Italian company Salini.
The total cost of these tasks is close to PLN 2.5 billion.
The investment is co-financed by the European Union's Centres under the Infrastructure and Environment Operational Programme 2014-2020.
The amount of funding is more than 1.3 billion PLN.
This section consists of a total of 38 engineering sites (bridges, viaducts, escakads) and a two-chamber tunnel of 2.06 km long.
As announced by the road manager, the 7.6 km section Lubín – Repair with temporary inclusion in the old DK7, which drivers will avoid the construction of the tunnel, will be made available this year.
The last section, Repair – Skomielna Biała about 3 km long, drivers will travel in 2021, after the completion of a two-chamber tunnel with a length of approximately 2.06 km.
Our goal is a welfare country.
"We are building a state of prosperity in Poland," said the Minister of Justice Zbigniew Ziobro.
He came to Szczecin to call for a vote on Councilman Darius Matecki, who is running for the Sejm from the Letter of Law and Justice.
"The programme of good change is the implementation of the Polish strategy of the state of prosperity," the minister said.
"We want the Poles to make a lot better money to keep their lives on a higher level.
This is necessary, because otherwise young, dynamic, well-educated people will be leaving Poland, and we cannot afford to.
For four years, our government has consistently implemented a programme that committed itself four years ago.
We said we'd introduce the 500 plus program.
Platform, Donald Tusk and Eva Kopcz said it's impossible that this money just isn't there.
We proved that the money was and was, but the PO did not care for those to whom it was meant to be."
Ziobro also mentioned the correction for children and the thirteenth pension – and that the 14th pension was also planned.
In addition to the "discretional division of national income", the priorities of the PSI are the fair state and economic development.
Money should not be a great source of money only for the pockets of the chosen ones, who have good relations with the establishment and power, but should reach the whole society equally, said politicians.
Emmanuel Macron honors Jacques Chirac
The president of France, Emmanuel Macron, said good-bye on Thursday in the television performance of his predecessor Jacques Chirac, who called him a great Frenchman and a great man of state.

Facebook with care about the user's well-being hides the taste of your favorites counter
As part of the first experiment in the world, which aims to improve users' self-esteem, some users of Facebook will soon be unable to see a number of favorites, reactions and videos.
The favorites will be hidden and visible only for the author of the post, and this change will be introduced in Australia following a similar test implemented on Instagram in July.
The new Facebook version, launched next Friday, will also be launched in Australia.
Mia Garlick, director of Facebook privacy in Australia, said that the change was the result of a self-esteem study and a mental health expert opinion indicating that a number of favorites could lead to comparisons with others.
"The work of the many groups working with us on the fight against harassment, as well as organisations in the field of mental health, has been very positive" – said Garlick.
Eliminating this counter will make people focus on the quality of their interactions and on the quality of their content, not on the number of favorites or reactions.
Sharing with others through the platform is expected to be more enjoyable and will not be received as a competition – she said.
Garlick has ensured that companies based on Facebook will continue to receive the same indicators and observations they have had before.
She said it was too early to determine whether the test would be extended to other countries, as had happened with Instagram when the test included Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
As with Instagram, which belongs to Facebook, there is no indication of when the experiment will end and whether the change will be permanently implemented.
"The user's preliminary comments on the new principles in Instagram were positive, but at this stage we are still learning and listening to the opinion," she said.
Speaking about the site of the world's experiment, Garlick said that Australia has very active, technically renowned Facebook users and Instagram users.
We believe that it is an amazing country that will provide us with sound opinions indicating whether new experience is valuable to those who benefit from our services or not.
Frequent: Councilmen want compensation for pilgrims from the chicken
For the time being, Czestochovský kory does not comment on the advisory appeal to the local metropolitan abp Wacław Depo about the transfer of financial compensation for the servicing of the waste management in the Pilgrim season.
The city is applying for 1 zloty from pilgrims.
He spoke about the metropolitan event on Friday at a press conference with, among other things, the leader of Spring Robert Biedron, organized on the leading side of the Bright Mountain of the Most Holy Virgin Mary, vice-president of the City Council and candidate for the Lukash Kot.
Kot reported that on the day before, the local councillors of SLD voted in their call to Abpa Wacław Depo for the transfer of one gold town from every visitor to Częstochova Pilgrim – to support the work of city services, municipal services, etc.
We accepted an appeal to the archbishop Depo to help the city, help us clean the pilgrims, prepare the city for pilgrims.
"We ask for a symbolic gold to be transferred to the city's budget from each pilgrim.
This will enable the city to provide them with better living conditions in Czestochowa," said the vice-president of the City Council.
Mariausz Bakalarz, who was asked for a comment by the spokesman for the Metropolitan MC Fr Mariusz Bakalarz, initially prepared a several-day reply, but then asked – as he indicated, for the instruction of Ab. Depo – to replace it with information on the content: “Until the official position of the City Council, we do not refer to the matter.”
According to the project on the site of the frequent magistrate's appeal to the abpa Depo, “the transfer of financial compensation to the town of Częchowy for the operation of the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season” refers to the project.
“In view of the increasing number of pilgrims arriving in Częstochowa and the increasing costs of operating the municipal waste management system during the Pilgrim season, taking into account the image of the city among the dwellings and residents, the vessels and the vessels, we want to take care of our common well-being, the small homeland of Częstochowa, in the context of the generally accepted canons, to propose a participation in the costs of using the waste system” is a part of the appeal.
"We wish to maintain the cleanliness of the pedestrian-road trains which are moving by pilgrims, using simultaneously small infrastructure, i.e. the outer baskets of waste, we present a proposal for symbolic participation in the municipal waste management system in the amount of PLN 1 per Pilgrim", it was written.
“In addition, in view of the annual cost of participation, which the city will cover from its own resources, taking care of the cleanliness and aesthetics of urban space, and stressing that such cooperation will bring benefits to all parties, we declare that 20% of the amount will be devoted to improving tourism infrastructure, e.g. by increasing the number of public toilets available”, the council said.
They pointed out that, in addition to financial matters, their proposal was based on the numerous reservations raised by the residents regarding the state of purity of the routes to which they were moved by pilgrims.
"With due regard to the cleanliness of our city and the possible positive effects of cooperation, the Council of Czestochowa calls on the Archbishop of Pied Piper Metropolis Wacław Depo to transfer financial compensation to the city of Czestochowa for handling the municipal waste management system during the Pilgrim season", repeated in appeal.
According to the Press Office of the Bright Mountain, there were 834 thousand participants in 200 nationwide pilgrimages to this sanctuary throughout the year.
About 124 thousand faithful arrived in 255 pedestrian pilgrims.
More than 8.8 thousand people came to Częstochowa in bicycle pilgrimages (133 groups) and 440 people (16 groups) in race pilgrimages.
Less than 20 people reached the conno sanctuary and more than 170 pilgrims from two groups – on rolls.
News TVP missed the Confederate when describing the survey
According to a poll by Pollster, in the PIC elections, 45% of the votes, KO 26%, Levica 14%, PSL 7%, and Confederation 5% would be obtained.
It was even written on the Super Express portal for which the probe was conducted.
The main edition of the News, describing the same survey, presented the results of only four first parties, completely bypassing the Confederate.
The head of the Lewandovska group made it clear that only four committees exceeded the electoral threshold and would enter the Sejm.
The TVP has also been shown to divide the fair mandates without taking into account the votes cast for the Confederate.
It would give the Pis self-governments.
In a comment to this situation, Krzysztof Bosak spoke of "public compromise on public honesty".
"They started with slogans about "the moral revolution", he recalled and said that this case was a sign of weakness.
Robert Winnicki wrote on Twitter that "The news of TVP" in subsequent actions against the Confederate shame Urban and Michnik".
He also noted the lack of reaction of right-wing journalists.
“But we also look at those who are obediently silent.
Those "rights", "independent", "incorruptible".
In a few years, they became a more primitive version of all that they were fighting with," he added.

Brother sentenced to life imprisonment for killing honourable community media stars Qandeel Baloch
Qandeel Baloch, who became a star thanks to photos published on social media, was strangled in July 2016.
The brother of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch was found guilty of her murder on Friday and sentenced to life imprisonment as the most notorious in this patriarchal country's "homicide".
Baloch, who won the fame by publishing bold selfies – good by Western standards, but in highly misogynistic Pakistan considered provocative – was strangled in July 2016.
Her brother, Muhammad Waseem, was arrested.
A few days later, he said during a press conference that he had no conscience for his actions and said that he had "obviously" murdered his sister and that her behaviour was "inadmissible".
His lawyer Sardar Mehmood told AFP that a court in the western town of Multan had found his client guilty and sentenced him to life in a long-awaited sentence.
"Inshallah (if God permits) will be acquitted by a higher court," he said.
Earlier, Baloch’s mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that she hoped her son would be acquitted.
"He is innocent.
She was my daughter, and this is my son," she said.
Baloch's murder took the lead in global information services and renewed calls for action against the so-called honour killings, in which victims – usually women – are killed for violating patriarchal social principles.
Women were burned, strangled, shot or shot for such crimes as choosing their own husband or, as in Baloch's case, for bringing shame to their family by manifesting their own sexuality.
Murders are usually committed by a close relative.
Under Pakistani law, Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (refoulement) may ask the nearest victims for forgiveness.
Three months after Baloch was murdered, Parliament adopted new legislation imposing life imprisonment for honour killings.
However, whether murder will be considered a honourable crime remains the responsibility of the judge, which means that murderers can theoretically invoke another motive and be acquitted.
In Baloch’s case, her parents initially insisted that their son be shown no favor at all.
However, the bereaved feel that they may lose him too, change their mind, and declare that they want his vindication.
The international outrage caused by the murder prompted the Pakistani state to take an unprecedented step and to declare itself heir to the parents, thereby forcing the case to take its course.
One of the more well-known works of Baloch is to offer strippers in front of the Pakistani cricket team and the establishment of a decalculated purple dress in Valentine's Day.
She was criticized and threatened, but many people, including young people, viewed her as breaking limits in a country in which posing as Kim Kardashian could be considered a bold and political movement to strengthen the position of women.
The roots of "honorous" killings lie in tribal social standards, which continue to dominate South Asia, and in particular standardise women's behaviour, although men may also be victims.

Anarchia doubles the number of resettled from north-west Nigeria to 40,000: UNHCR
On Friday, the United Nations said that the rising violence had led to a doubling of the number of people resettled from north-west Nigeria to about 40,000 people in the last four months.
The United Nations Agency for Refugees has stated that the concerns have created a "new emergency humanitarian situation", which requires an inter-agency effort to raise $35.5 million in new resources by the end of the year.
Babar Baloch, spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said that the Islamist group Boko Haram, which has been conducting the uprising in the north of the country for decades, has not been responsible for the latest attacks.
The increase in violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto, Zamfara and Katsina observed over the past 10 months is rather the result of organized armed groups.
"This paints a frightening picture of anarchy and uncertainty," he told reporters on Friday.
He reported frequent reports of kidnappings, tortures, extortions, murders and sexual assaults by attackers who also destroyed houses and stolen livestock.
Military and police have been sent to combat criminal gangs in the region.
However, the military is drawn from the fight against Boko Haram and the branch of the state of Islam in West Africa, which separated itself from its former group in 2016.
"The refugees do not come with the names of the groups," he said.
They come for it with terrible stories.
The majority of refugees go to neighboring Niger.
In his statement, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said that more people are expected to run to Niger in the coming months, along with a deteriorating security situation, in particular in Sokoto.
A new date has been set for the trial of a man accused of killing a woman and two children.
A new date was scheduled for the trial for the Guatemalan man accused of killing Iowa's apartment and her two children.
Acts of the Polish Regional Court show that the 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Orellana is accused of three first-degree murders under what the authorities say was a false name originally given to the police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He didn't plead guilty.
According to the police, he shot 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter and her 5-year-old son on 16 July at their home in Des Moines.
According to the judicial acts, the new date of the hearing, i.e. January 27, will give representatives of both parties more time to prepare.
Immigration and Customs officials in the United States claim that Escobar-Orellana is staying in the United States illegally and has been deported twice before the shooting.
In 2010, he was convicted of illegal entry into the United States.
‘The Sun’: Boris Johnson in the face of a rebellion of a cabinet seeking to lower the demands of all bruxite and reach a compromise agreement with Brussels
Just three weeks before the final summit of EU leaders, the country's most important people in the prime minister's vicinity are concerned that more important concessions are not enough time.
Boris Johnson faces the risk of rebellion on the part of a cabinet seeking to reduce demands for freshness and reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
The negotiations included an impassion on a new customs system, which would be a substitute for a backstop mechanism for Ireland, as Brussels identified other arrangements offered by Johnson as "unexecutable".
The Corona ministers expect the EU's decision-makers, led by the head of Germany Angela Merkel, to offer you a three-year backstop compromise at the last moment to the critical Tory Leader.
Journalists The Sun spoke with three different cabinet ministers, all of whom are preparing to confront the prime minister after the annual Tory Conference next week in Manchester.
They will demand the Prime Minister's "aggressive" strategy drawn up by his close adviser, Dominik Cummings, to try to apply the bluff to the EU and threaten to leave the Union without an agreement and then to accept the offer made by the Union at the latest.
One of the ministers of the Cabinet defined a binding verdict of the Supreme Court on Tuesday's end of Parliament's suspension as a "warning signal" and added: "The only way for us to leave the European Union on 31 October is to do so on the basis of an agreement.
We will never defeat the arrhythmetics in the House of the Gmin, which works for our benefit.
The Prime Minister must bend now and accept what he is able to receive.
Aggression does not pay: it is obvious that Cummings' plan burned down on the bench.
We can't fight so many fronts.
The second minister of the office committed himself to handing Johnson over to try to push the former Prime Minister Theresa May's agreement if everything else fails.
The minister said, "If I have to, I will tell the Prime Minister to re-submit the agreement proposed by Theresa May in the House of the Gmin."
There are many opportunities to vote, and everyone depends very much on ending this topic.
If we're forced to extend the deadline, it's the end of Boris Johnson and all of us.
John Major told Boris Johnson that he didn't take the negotiations seriously.
In a touchy speech, the first tory minister said: “The Prime Minister tells us that he wants an agreement with the European Union.
However, we do not see him sitting in Brussels and working on it.
Instead, he fights bulls in Scotland, checks eggs in Wales, and fights with citizens on the main streets of cities – everything in the eyes of the world, as if the election campaign had already lasted well."
The speaker of the current prime minister admitted yesterday that the agreement was still far away, and he added: "No one should have delusions: a very long way to make an agreement."
However, the speaker also said that the law of Benna implementing the postponement of bruxit by three months in the absence of an agreement "actively weakens our negotiating position" in Brussels.
He said: “There is no doubt that this law makes it difficult for us to negotiate, but despite it, the Prime Minister, along with his fellow workers, is still trying to make progress through hard work.”
Commissioner for Bristity Stephen Barclay is returning to Brussels today, where more talks will be held with Michel Barnier on the EU side.
They will discuss the way the zone works for the whole of Ireland for food and animal.
A dog with no nose and no legs is going after Instagram.
Perfectly impeccable
Kundelek was to be put to sleep.
However, this has been prevented.
The bitch was transported from Romania to Great Britain by Beacon Animal Rescue Centre.
The picture of the dog was posted on Facebook.
Kate Comfort fell in love with the animal from her first guess.
"I initially had difficulties convincing my husband to adopt because we had three dogs already," she said.
The woman decided to take care of her bitch until she was adopted.
But no one's ever reported it.
“The fact that no one wanted her, made me want to take care of her more and more.
She was sensitive and needed love," Kate said.
Finally, the marriage decided to adopt Bonnie.
"Our Bonnie is perfectly impeccable.
We love her the way she is, and if anyone doesn't like the way she looks, it's his problem, not ours," the woman said.
Bonnie has become the star of social media over time.
Over 14,000 interns are watching her on Instagram.
Lorraine Kelly: It was said that I would never make a career on TV with a musical accent
According to Lorraine Kelly, TV bosses said that because of Glasgow accent, "never will make a career" as a presenter.
Referring to her 35-year-old career in the television industry Kelly, age 59, she admitted that before her first performance on the screen she felt "very upset".
"I was only 25 years old and very nervous," she said.
When I was working at BBC Scotland as a search and information specialist, the boss said that by my Glasgow accent, I would never succeed on TV.
I went to London to meet the entire TV team and watch the program's release before I took over my duties at the Glasgow office.
I'll never forget an interview with Bette Davis from Anne Diamond and Mike Morris that morning.
I didn't believe I was in the same room with a legend.
I knew I wanted to stay here.
Before Kelly became a Scottish correspondent for TV-am in 1984, she began her career as a reporter for a local newspaper in East Kibride, Scotland.
She then started running such programs as “GMTV”, “ITV Breakfast” and “Daybreak” to start her morning program “Lorraine”, which he took from her name.
The 35th anniversary of her career celebrates with a special program during which she will mention her best remembered moments and interviews.
The presenter said that the secret of her long internship on television is "passion and enthusiasm" and "fleeing", adding: "It must be hard to work.
Be honest and authentic.
Prepare for the programmes and be both interested and interesting.
When she mentions the media reports that triggered her emotions, Kelly says that "very hard" to her was the report of the bombing in Dunblane.
I had no idea that many families killed or injured children were watching our live programme with Dunblane the day after the terrible murder of sixteen children and their teachers.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, whose five-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked me for a private meeting, during which we talked at her house for hours.
The whole meeting took place quietly, and Pam Ross and I have been friends since Joanna's funeral, in which I took part.
She added that "very difficult" was an interview with Kate and Gerry McCannami shortly after their daughter Madeline disappeared in 2007 and that "really admires their strength and courage".
They have to deal with the pain because they don't know what happened to their beloved daughter, and they have to endure the most outrageous comments of online trolls.
I'm with them with all my heart.
The program for the 35th anniversary of Lorraine Kelly's work on TV will start at 8:30 p.m. on Monday, September 30 at the ITV station.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga feared imprisonment
The senior state official claimed that Vice-President Constantino Chiweng had refused to take over the office of President Robert Mugabe at the top of the coup because he was afraid of being imprisoned to confirm his military takeover in November 2017.
As reported last week by The Zimbabwe Independent, Mugabe offered Vice-President Chiwenge to take over the presidency during his negotiations with the military in the context of a coup.
However, the senior state official announced in the social media that Chiwenga did not reject the offer of fear, but that he had reviewed Mugabe's plan to use it to prove to world leaders and the African Union (UA) that he had actually lost during the coup.
However, on Twitter, which confirmed that the 37-year-old ruler of Zimbabwe wished to hand over to Vice-President Chiweng rather than President Emmson Mnangwe, Jamwanda 2, whose officials confirmed to the State that he was a senior state official in the Bureau of the President and the Council of Ministers, it was stated that intense negotiations were under way at that time.
Officials of the State claimed that Mugabe had contacted Chiweng through one of his envoys when he realized that the authorities were getting out of his hands.
Mediation between the military authorities and the late former president had, in the opinion of a senior state official, three stages.
The official claimed that among the negotiators was President George Charamba, the then head of the Central Intelligence Organisation Aaron Nheper and the spiritual representative of the Roman Catholic bishop Fidelis Mukonori.
The former head of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, has been another element since Mugabe sent him with a one-man mission to present the offer to the President of Chiwenge, who was the head of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces (SOZ).
A man who, after his death even more than he was considered to be an icon of Africa, tried vainly to obtain from the UA a condemnation of military action, trying to persuade other African leaders to intervene.
The offer made by the deceased (Mugabe) to the former Chief of Defence Forces (SSO) of Chiwenge was not an option.
"It was a desperate act to save a situation that had taken dangerously fast pace, removing part of the deceased's family," wrote an official (Jamwanda).
But there was also some political temptation that helped the dead to reverse the situation in a completely non- diplomatic manner.
It is enough to recall that the commanders stated that they did not overthrow or overthrow the constitutional order, which would cause their conflict with the UA's position on coups.
The deceased (Mugaba) hoped that the SSO (Chiwenga) would then swallow up the bait, abruptly interrupting the claims of the leaders that they had not overthrown the constitutional order.
The hope for the deceased (Mugabe) was that the UA, which, on the margin, was still highly disorientated by the whole situation and the way it fits into its theoretical conversion taxonomy, would have no other choice than to describe it as a coup, and therefore the call for military intervention would be credible.
That's the spirit of the offer, and with that kind of feedback, it's the offer.
Officials said Mugabe made the move when he realized that the defense forces were no longer ready to protect him.
They said Mugabe was forced to sign the resignation letter after he warned the strongman that he was risking the Kaddafi-style lynch.
Army chiefs have told him they won't return guns against the citizens if they move to his Blue Roof residence.
And at the same time Mugabe had two desires to save his family and prove that the army took power," the official added.
The former SSO and the commanders correctly read the assumptions.
The envoy (Gono) was given this desperate message to understand – through a powerful metaphor – that the tiri věmakwapa-makwapa (belonging to the Camouflage sect, namely the military), we are not politicians or are not competing with each other at political level, said a higher state official.
Officials tell the State that the military has notified military commanders in the area through attachés who stayed in Zimbabwe that they do not intend to overthrow Mugabe, but to deal with the surrounding “criminalists”.
Mugabe tried to use the same strategy to retaliate Mnangagwa to return from short exile in South Africa to talk about conversion and success.
In addition to negotiating with the army, Mugabe also sought assistance in the region.
The inhabitants of South Africa, who are key elements of the process – not only because of their economic and regional power, but also because of the fact that then President Jacob Zum was President of the Republic of South Africa – refused to intervene, but clearly indicated that if the military invaded Mugabe's home, as many times in the background, the South African army would immediately appear in Harare.
"It didn't work because Putin and African leaders didn't choose this route," said the Independent, a certain informant.
China needs strong leadership, or they will fall apart, as stated in the Policy Paper
China needs a strong, unified leadership of the Communist Party, because otherwise the country will "break up" – the government said in a policy paper issued on Friday in the previous 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.
The Chinese government’s press office reported in the White Paper that the success of the country since the Communists took over 70 years ago has been reduced to party leadership.
China occupies a large area, has complex national conditions, and rarely there are administrative difficulties.
The document mentions that without uniform and strong leadership, China will move towards divisions and decay, which will be disastrous for the world.
The Chinese authorities have long used hard-handed policies to address the problems, as in the case of the suppression of pro-democratic protests in Beijing in 1989, justifying the need to maintain the country's stability.
President Xi Jinping, who will head the anniversary of the second to the size of the world economy on Tuesday, has strengthened the party's governments even more strongly since he took office at the end of 2012, and has imposed sanctions on those who may challenge the power.
Xi also oversees the military modernisation programme that has struck the region out of balance.
The document states that China is not trying to export its development model or wants to import any foreign models, just for peace, not for hegemony.
The Chinese don't have the genes of other nations or the domination of the world.
In modern times China has been oppressed by great powers, and wars and anxieties have pushed them deeply into the face of the sufferings they have experienced; China will never give others the suffering they have experienced.
China celebrates this anniversary in uncertain times for a country engaged in a bitter trade war with the United States and facing challenges due to the slowing economy, as well as anti-government protests in sub-China Hong Kong.
The document says that China will never “sell” its most important interests or allow anything to damage their sovereignty.
With regard to the trading dispute, the Washington paper stated that "the dangers of trade wars and the further increase in customs tariffs do not lead to a solution to problems".
China is a mature economy with a full industrial system, a complete chain of industry, a wide place on the market and a strong pace of economic development.
The document added that "Wars will never weaken it".
China is certain that they are able to face the challenges, the crisis turn into a new opportunity and open up a new world.
It has also been added that the United States should take a rational view of China's development, because China does not intend to question the position of the United States or want to replace the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and it is even less likely that they will stop China's development.
Restriction and weakening of other countries and the transfer of national misunderstandings abroad will not give the United States a strong position.
Jack the Palkiewicz World: Dubai, Real Face
Dubai's emirate is a place still searching for its own identity, torn between the Bedouin tradition, religious radicalism of Islam and extremism of progressiveism.
This new trend of global tourism leader engenders imagination and desire, glaring the vanity of wealthy snobistic hotels and attracting the fortunes of investors and merchants in tax haven status.
The website is enthused by the enthusiasm for this city of dreams, which is an exciting temple of luxury and a concentrated concentration of architecture of the 21st century in one.
Risen on oil-rich sands, the Emirates has become the one for those who love the rest, five-star hotels, beautiful weather and swimming pools located hundreds of metres above the ground.
Many admire the ubiquitous beauty here, appreciate the creative hyperactivism and the hysterical pursuit of avant-gardeness.
Here is a city whose motto says all: "Stombling, stunned, and charmed."
And it's almost every step of the way.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, calling it a city without character.
According to British writer Lawrence Osborne, “full of extremes and contradictions of metropolis took the dimension of the cheap grotesque.”
It has turned into a futuristic nightmare, totally dominated by the Guinness Book of Records, an unofficial constitution of emirate.
Because everything here has to be bigger and nicer than anywhere else in the world.
However, there is a lack of something in old Europe that may be less transparent but important to the quality of life.
In Wroclaw, Berlin or Madrid, everyone feels at home.
And in Dubai, I'm sure it isn't.
Running away from the world of magic, I broke his golden mask, exposing the other face of artificial paradise.
A face that's not spoken out loud or written about.
I'm showing the misery of Asians contrasting with the fairy-tale living conditions of the divine ethnic caste of Dubai, the grandchildren of the unwritten Bedouins.
I'm going to extreme poverty, for example, to the ghetto on the outskirts of the city, where the army of Asian workers lives under cruel conditions.
It was in one generation that they built in the enslavement conditions of the wilderness of Manhattan.
They came here to be visited by good wages and the possibility of living a decent life for their families, and they found a nightmare.
This tourist will never see it, because it could blow up in the air created for years by Dubai's myth.
Increasingly, the criticism of the international community makes the subject of cheaper labour becoming extremely difficult for the emir.
Mel C from the Spice Girls team banned in her home conversations about diets after her struggle with eating disorders
Melanie Chisholm of Spice Girls admitted that there was a diet ban in her home, after she had struggled with eating disorders, for years eating only fruit and vegetables.
For years, Spice sports have not eaten and “obsessively practiced” due to the pressure of being a famous member of the pop group worldwide, which has subsequently caused depression and eating disorders.
It now reveals that her experience affects how she rears her daughter, Scarlet, and therefore “does not allow her home to talk about diets”.
"Scarlet is now 10 years old and I am beginning to see that she is more aware of her appearance," Mel said.
"I believe that one of the benefits of the experience of nutrition disorders is that I am very aware of how I speak with it.
The use of positive language has now become my habit.
In an interview with the magazine Women's Health Mel, who won fame in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls team, said that in the days before the emergence of social media, the press 'infuriated' comments on it caused complexes.
"I started looking at myself in an inappropriate way, abandoning certain groups of food products, practicing more and more obsessively until I began to have a lack of weight," he says.
"I was sick and it probably lasted a few years."
A Picture That Shaked the World
The Polish girl and the U.S. documentaryist gave the world a witness of the atrocities of war.
The legendary photograph of Julien Bryan can be seen at the Museum of World War II in Gdańsk
"Listen to my story.
I'm speaking from the besieged town of Warsaw.
I can and must speak on behalf of the Polish people about what happened here.
America must act, must help!", began his radio performance by documentaryist, photographer, Julien Bryan.
In the tragic, September day of 1939 he was in the capital of Poland, saw the drama of the bombed city and its inhabitants.
His relationship was reflected in a wide echo in the West.
President of Warsaw Stefan Starzyński first helped him, borrowed the car, but then asked him to leave immediately for his own safety.
Bryan wrote a goodbye letter to his family in the United States, deposited it in the embassy safe, and... stayed.
For the next four weeks, he tried to be wherever Warsawians were.
400 planes and artillery almost nonstop attacked the city.
Bryan witnessed the death, the suffering, the struggle to survive in the city's jugs.
Just before surrender with the embassy staff, he took the negatives out of the ocean.
He didn't say anything about Hitler's crimes.
He appealed to the world: “What happened to Warsaw will be Paris, London, and even New York. ”
His shocking chronicles were seen by President Eleanor Roosevelt.
Soon the United States began preparing for the war.
"Dad showed the truth and thus fought German propaganda.
They were making films that were glorifying their brilliance.
They said they didn't attack women and children, and people believed them," says Sam Bryan, son of Julien.
A jury hearing against a former athlete accused of multiple rapes
In front of the jury, a rape trial is being conducted against the former team of the Delaware University, which is being framed for numerous sexual assaults.
On Friday, after 10 days of testifying and listening to arguments, jury members joined in settling the fate of 23-year-old Clay Conaway.
A woman who turned 21, claims that Conaway raped her when she went to his home in June 2018.
The event took place three weeks after the conclusion of the two acquaintances on the Bumble meeting page and the sending of the woman by the man of the picture on which he appeared naked.
The woman is one of six Conaways sexual assault charges between 2013 and 2014.
According to the defendants, the hugging that the woman consented to turned into a rape, which she objected to.
The defense attorneys refer to a woman’s conflicting relationship with a memory gap and claim that the woman probably regretted that there had been an intimate rapprochement.
Gold on two wheels: Polish bike for a million zlotys
The gold-covered bike worth a million zlotys could be seen on jubilee, 10th edition at the International Bike Fairs Bike-EXPO.
It's an extraordinary vehicle printed on a 3D printer.
His designer, 30-year-old Adam Zdanovič, just received a bike show by Oscar at the World Customs Show in Las Vegas.
An unusual specimen made a furor at the fair. - The bike is covered with a golden spray chromium, underneath it is the highest test of silver.
It's an unusual shell made by my friend from Zor.
"There's a saddle, there's pedals, there's a steering wheel, you could drive it normally.
It can develop a speed of 50 kilometers per hour.
It's an electric bike," he's a designer.
‘The bicycle caroseria has been printed on a 3D printer.
It's a cube of faith.
I came up with this model's idea by going on my first bike home, a few years ago.
I drew it on the card and hid it deep into the drawer.
The sketch was waiting five years for implementation.
The bike itself was built for three years", adds Adam Zdanovich.
"It was extremely difficult to hide all the elements under the bodywork.
In there are batteries, wires, elements that make up a structure.
It's hidden under the wheelwork mounted in 11 elements on the steel wheel frame.
There's a hidden engine.
The bike was built a week before I left for the United States for the World Bike Show.
I couldn't quite decide what this manager was supposed to be.
It consists of transport.
The bike weighs 90 kilograms," he concludes.
The gold-covered bike was appreciated in Las Vegas for the most important competition category “Best One-In-One Customer Spectacular”.
Film material shows strong pollution of popular tourist destinations
Sydney Bay surrounded by an opera building, Circular Quay port, Luna Park amusement park and, of course, the famous Harbour Bridge Bridge makes a significant contribution to $21.9 billion annually pumped into the Australian economy by tourists visiting Sydney.
But beneath the bridge lies the ugly truth.
The known Sydney Bay is one of the most contaminated waterways in the country to which the volume of pollution is equal to the capacity of about 15 Olympic swimming pools each year.
These horrifying statistics make one of our greatest tourist attractions at the same time one of our most dirty aquariums.
According to the new film material entitled “Sydney Bay — Up and Down”, the waters around the most popular city of Australia are full of batons, plastic nets and bottles, lost shoes and parts of clothing, even dead animals, and all of this goes to the bay with rainwater.
However, the largest component choking our shipping channels is plastic.
"I would call it a paradox," says Dr. Katherine Dafforn, deputy research program director Sydney Harbour Research Program, in a video published on 27 September, with the publication deliberately coincided with World Tourism Day.
This aqueen looks beautiful, but it is one of the most changed and contaminated rivers along our coast.
CSIRO estimates that every hour about 1560 kg of plastic reaches our waterways, and most of it affects the bay through storm draining.
"After such great rainfall of the bay... it looks rather tragic," said Dr. Dafforn.
Two thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater.
However, as with the iceberg, the problem with Sydney Bay is much more serious under the surface of the water, as 70% of the plastic entering the ocean falls to the bottom of the sea.
"In my opinion, if you don't spend time underwater, you can't really realize what's in the deep," said Richard Nicholls, owner of the Div Centre Manly, pointing out that he and his team are pulling about 500 kg of plastic out of the water on their own every year.
I think that if more people knew (which is under water), they would just be scared.
It's overwhelming... more than half of what we find on the bottom are plastic nets.
The other 50% are things that are made of plastic at least.
When you look at the bay, it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that all this plastic and all the other trash we're getting right under the surface.
Jeremy Brown, co-founder and Managing Director of Ocean Protect, said that there are ways in which people – both local and tourist – can help reduce the amount of plastic and leftovers coming to our waterways.
"This has to start at the source," he said.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic we use, better lead to the recovery of materials and have a greater awareness of what we're releasing into the sewers that eventually get into the oceans.
If we destroy the ocean, we're going to be destroyed because 50% of the oxygen we inhaled comes from the ocean.
It absorbs 30% carbon dioxide and our source of food.
However, we can sort this bay and restore it to its former glory, and it's very simple.
If we kill our oceans, we'll kill ourselves.
The film material, financed by the recycling company TOMRA in its broader efforts to educate Australians in the field of environmental protection and to reduce the negative effects of pots on drinks, which are often in contact with the environment, coincides with a study on the relationship between artificial and mental health, which was published this month.
A new survey of 546 children aged between 12 and 18 found that 82% of respondents felt helpless about plastic waste and 25% of adults had a problem with disposable plastic packaging waste.
The study found that plastic waste was also the fourth largest concern of parents, and 93% of the 551 parents surveyed said that their concerns about the quantity of plastic waste entering the oceans were growing.
Many people who participated in the study said that they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they simply did not know how to make significant changes, which led to environmental fear.
Poland – Slovenia.
Memes after the retinal match in the semifinal ME
It wasn't an easy game.
The Slovenians had a lively audience on their side, which effectively deconcentrated Polish retinas.
Many controversy has also been raised by judges who, in one of the actions, did not have four reflections on the economy's side.
It happened at the crucial moment of the first set, when Vital Heynen had a chance to jump off the rivalry and win the first match.
However, this did not happen, and the Poles eventually had to recognise the superiority of the rival who will play in the tournament finals after winning 3:1.
Ghana: Traders from Kaneshie support Psychiatric Hospital in Akra
Members of the Kaneshie Market Association gave food worth 30,000 GH yesterday to a psychiatric hospital in Akra during a short ceremony held in Akra.
This is part of the 40th anniversary of the Kaneshie Market complex.
Various food items, fruit, soft drinks, biscuits, clothes, christening, paradise bananas, manioc and water bags were included.
During the visit, the group also talked to several patients at the facility.
The event was attended by members of the Management Staff of Accra Markets Limited, Association Directors and Mother Queens.
Presenting the items, Mrs Mercy Naa Afrova Needjan, President of the Women's Association of the Great Accra Region, announced that donation is part of the regular activity of the welfare group in the framework of social responsibility.
She noticed that supporting the care of patients at the facility was necessary in order to show them love and to allow them to feel part of society.
Mrs. Needjan promised the hospital support from the association and called on other associations to imitate that gesture.
In accepting the gifts, Dr. Pinnaman Appau, the director of the hospital, commended the Association for its support and promised it would be well used for the benefit of patients.
She called on other organizations to support the hospital.
Google is creating a cloud in Poland.
PKO BP Partner
An operator of the National Cloud, PKO BP and PFR, has entered into a strategic partnership with Google.
Cooperation aims to help Polish companies implement and exploit the potential of cloud computing technology.
Google Cloud Platform products will be included in the offer of the Operator of the National Cloud, and Google will open in Warsaw a so-called Google Cloud region – a hub of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and Eastern Europe.
Google Cloud will be the first installation of a global, public cloud computing in Central Europe.
The digitisation of Polish companies was one of the key assumptions behind the project of the creation of the National Cloud, initiated and developed by PKO Bank Polski and by the Polish Development Fund, the shareholders of the company.
The partnership of the National Cloud and Google is another important step on the road, which we set out less than a year ago, announcing the appointment of the Operator of the National Cloud.
The aim remains unchanged – digitisation of the Polish economy and its growth dynamics.
"Now Polish companies will gain additional, refined tools to implement it.
Using them, they increase their chances of promoting the world league, which we all care about.
The fact that Google joins them today greatly strengthens our joint project," says Zbigniew Jagieło, president of PKO Bank of Poland.
The Polish Development Fund points out that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern industries and enterprises.
"Investment in the National Cloud Operator is ideally included in the PFR strategy as an important element of the digitisation of the country.
It will provide entrepreneurs with modern and affordable solutions based on cloud architecture.
"I am convinced that this cooperation will also have a positive impact on the development of the Polish IT market and will attract the best professionals," adds Paweł Boris, president of the PFR.
Google Cloud offers advanced technologies, products and analytical tools based on leading technical infrastructure, providing computing power and data storage services.
Customers in Poland will find in the service portfolio all key products of Google Cloud Platform such as Compute Engine, App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spinner or BigQuery.
The inclusion of Google Cloud services in the offer of the National Cloud will allow Polish entrepreneurs to use exactly the same advanced technologies that their global competitors use.
However, we will remain in the Polish jurisdiction and under the control of local regulators", says Michał Potokek, President of the National Cloud.
It adds that the company will be ready for megatrends such as internet stuff (IoT), which repeatedly increase the need for computing power necessary for the processing of huge data sets.
VI General Polish Seniors Parade
On the very south, 24 August 2019, at Ronda de Gaulle in Warsaw, the VI Senior Parade “Dojníli Spaniardi” and the Picnik Generations began, events organized by the Foundation of Beginnings.
According to the Foundation’s Premysław Wiśniewski: “The parade is an opportunity on a world scale.
The sixth time she went through the centre of Warsaw to demonstrate how large and diverse communities are seniors.
Through the Parada, we are countering harmful stereotypes affecting older people and calling for intergenerational solidarity."
The parade was conducted by a special floor bus serving as a musical mobile scene, on which the traditionally famous Warsaw DJ Wiki appeared.
The participants in the joyful Corodo, with the second known Warsaw and world breakthroughs, passed through Alejami Jerozolimski, ul. Kruwa to the Poznańszów Square of Warsaw, ul. Mazowiecki to the Płac J. Piłsudski Square and the Royal and Kraków suburbs at Campus Main University of Warsaw.
During the march, in which several thousand seniors, representing 300 senior organisations from all over Poland, were attended by colourful delegations by numerous participants on the route of march, Warsaw and tourists.
Two organized groups in company shirts of yellow and blue color took part in the parade from Legionow.
The first representative of University of the III Ages and Senior+ Club and the second representative under the name SAG, the Senior Active Group of the Animators.
In Campus, university organizers prepared, among other things, gastronomic and numerous stand-ups of institutions and companies offering services and products to seniors to improve their daily lives and functioning.
There were medical, cosmetic, culinary, recreational, sports and fashion stands.
For example, at the Stylish Senior Seniors stand from professional Hanna Piekarska and designer Agnieszka Wyrval, you could get tips and information on current trends in fashion 60+.
In addition, the stand offered a post-stage science workshop and poses for photos.
It was a derailment to the fashion show of the stylish seniors.
At the stand of the Polish Voice of Senior, there was the latest release of the letter and materials on the campaign “Stop Manipulating – Don’t Buy At Presentation!".
Another stand was offered cosmetic, movable, plastic and artistic workshops.
A few could be researched and consulted with health and nutrition professionals.
Discussion panels were also organised with the participation of Helen Norovich, Beaty Tadli, Marioli Bojarska-Ferenc, Tomasz Jacykov and Robert Janowski.
The picnic did not lack vocal and musical attractions.
Polish song legend – Krzysztof Krawczyk appeared on the estrada, and in the evening an intergenerational dance was held, which led the DJ Wiki.
Tasmanian devils can provide guidance on cancer treatment
The Tasmanians may have the key to cancer treatment – researchers have made a breakthrough discovery that may revolutionize therapy for patients
Medical researchers have discovered a way to mask certain cancer cells.
Researchers have found that the same process occurs in the Tasmanian and human devils
It is hoped that this discovery will bring new treatments for cancer patients
What do the Tasmanians and humans have in common?
Cancer cells that may become invisible.
Researchers, including Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have made a breakthrough discovery that can help revolutionize the treatment of some cancers if they do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also contain a key to the treatment of fatal tumors within the face that threaten the future of the endangered Tasmanian devil.
The study established a method of masking certain cancer cells in both humans and purses by means of a group of proteins called PRC2, which excludes a marker which would otherwise give a signal to the immune system to attack a cancer.
This can be the biggest challenge for the treatment of small cell lung cancer, neuroblastomas and skin cancers called Mercla's cell cancers.
"The great importance of this project is that in patients who sometimes develop resistance to immune therapy, we can be able to reverse the process," said AAP lead researcher Mark Dawson of Peter Mac.
Existing therapies can be directed to re-introduction of markers, proteins called MHC, allowing the immune system to recognise cancer cells.
"This potentially has far-reaching implications for people with lung cancer," said Professor Dawson.
"It is one of the most common diseases on earth.
Maybe we can heal her much better.
Researchers also hope that the discovery will someday be used to treat the face tumors of the Tasmanian devil, where cancer cells similarly avoid detection.
"It is unusual that the same process is happening (in the case of cancers in people and in the Tasmanian devils)," said Professor Dawson.
“How difficult it has been to treat the tumors of the Tasmanian devils so far.
But if medicines that work in humans can also be used in the Tasmanian devils, there is a possibility that this will help control the disease."
Scientists are amazed at the fact that a very large planet orbits around a truly small star
Scientists marvel at the discovery of the solar system of 30 light-years from Earth, which undermines our current understanding of the processes of planetary creation, as a large planet similar to Jupiter circles around a small star called the red dwarf.
Artistic illustration of the gas-type planet GJ 3512b circled around the red dwarf central star, published on 26 September 2019.
In general, the stars are much larger than even the largest planets orbiting them.
However, as scientists say on Thursday, in this case the star and the planet are slightly different in size.
The size of a star called GJ 3512 is about 12% of the size of the sun, and the mass of the planet that orbits it is at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet of our solar system.
“Yes, it’s an absolute surprise” said astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales of the Catalan Institute of Space Research at the Spanish Institute of Space Research, who led studies published in Science.
The discovery is surprising because the theoretical models of solar system formation suggest that low mass stars typically become mother stars for smaller planets similar to Earth or smaller Neptunes.
"In this case, we discovered a gas-type planet similar to Jupiter, which circled around a very small star," Morales added.
The planet, which, like Jupiter, consists mainly of gas, was discovered using a telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.
It surrounds its star after a very elliptical orbit, and the full circle lasts 204 days.
Red dwarfs are small and have relatively low surface temperature.
The GJ 3512 star is not only much smaller than the Sun, but to some extent has a size comparable to the size of a very large planet, as it is only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
They emit less energy, so they are paler than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather low and is approximately below 3800 (degrees) Kelvin (6,380 degrees Fahrenheit / 3527 degrees Celsius).
"This is why they have a red colour," Morales said.
"There is evidence of the existence of a second planet currently orbiting this star, while the third planet could have been thrown out of the star system in the past, which could explain the elliptical orbit of a planet similar to Jupiter," Morales said.
Planets come from the same interstellar disk of gas and dust that gives birth to the star around which the planets orbit.
According to the leading model of the formation of planets called the accretion model, the object is originally created from solid particles in the disk, and the force of gravity of the planet at the early stage of development allows the atmosphere to emerge from surrounding gas.
This unusual arrangement can explain a competitive model called gravity instability.
"In that case, the prototype disk around the young star can be a little more massive than we expect and can be cold," Morales said.
This leads to a disturbance in the stability of the disk, and therefore some thicker areas may emerge.
These masses can grow until the planet's collapse and creation.
Delicacies worker accused of having a member of a fascist dip containing methamphetamine
The Marion Sheriff's Office detained Cassandra Medina-Hernandez, 38 years old, for the submission of a member of the methamphetamine fascist dip.
On Thursday, the 38-year-old Cassandra Ani Medina-Hernandez was accused of providing methamphetamine and of using this substance controlled by another person, both crimes are crimes of second degree.
The charge was dropped on the basis of an event of 9 September in the Thriftway grocery store in Jefferson.
A 27-year-old co-worker told the deputy sheriff of Marion County that she saw Medina-Hernandez doing the beans dip during lunch during the lunch break.
On the basis of the statement, it is known that the victim of a crime who, according to what she handed to the investigator, never took methamphetamine said that “she thought that one of her pieces tasted strangely, but it did not arouse any suspicions.”
When she got back to work, she felt that she had a stomach spread and that she couldn't stop on her feet.
According to the newspaper Albany Democratic-Herald, she went to a local hospital where it was found that the fascist dip could contain methamphetamine.
Based on reports from The Smoking Gun, according to the police, another Thriftway network worker said that Medina-Hernandez “telled her that she would add drugs to the food”, while another admitted that the suspect had sent her a message, claiming that methamphetamine had reached the fascicle dip by accident.
The OregonLive site informs about the recording from the monitoring of the delicacies, which allegedly shows how the back of the Medina-Hernandez camera pulls something out of the bra, becomes behind the microwave and bends.
Next, it straightens out, wipes out the nose, comes to the table, and dips the beans in a small paper dish.
According to the police, the thing she pulled out of her bra was probably also on the plate.
The Oregon newspaper Statesman-Journal states that the staff of the sheriff's office claim that there is no suspicion at present that contaminated food should be given to customers.
Medina-Hernandez is in Marion County Prison, with a designated bail of $520,000.
According to The Smoking Gun, her extensive police record indicates that a woman has already been sentenced for assault, robbery, identity theft, the supply of methamphetamine, the theft, the possession of methamphetamine and the possession of illicit weapons.
Johnson's putting a blow in the delay-related mix.
Boris Johnson's trip to the United Nations General Assembly was not elegantly interrupted by the historic ruling of the Supreme Court.
However, his triumphant speech in the House of the Gmin did not betray either shame or remorse.

Marian Banas.
What's KAS doing about Chief NIK?
Renting of property for an amount below the market price is reservations that arise in connection with the case of the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control Marian Banas.
What the Treasury is doing on this matter was asked at the Treasury Department in Krakow and at the Ministry of Finance.
Bertold Kittel, in his report to Superviser, TVN, expressed doubts about the claims made by the Supreme President of the Supreme Chamber of Control Marian Banas.
She's been investigating the Central Anti-Corruption Office for months.
The check is scheduled to end in the second half of October, after parliamentary elections.
According to the statements, Banas was to rent a 400 - square - foot [400 sq m] stone and two smaller dwellings.
In total, he received 65,700 zlotys a year.
The report "Superviewer" revealed that the hotel had an hourly stay in the house that he rented.
The chief of NIK later explained on state television why he only rented over 5,000 zlotys a month.
"Vyborcza", referring to property valuation experts, she estimated that it should be 15,000 zlotys per month behind the stone itself.
"The amount was lower for a simple reason: I entered into a pre-contract and just because the tenant was to buy the stone, it caused me to agree to the lower rent that the remaining duties would be settled when selling the stone," Banas convinced.
However, there were doubts as to whether such proceedings constituted a violation of the law.
Konrad Zabada, spokesperson for the Chamber of Treasury in Krakow, told TVN24 that “this case is directly dealt with by the Ministry of Finance”.
"All such questions, please refer to the Minister of Finance," he added.
The failure explained that in such cases, “the National Treasury is in the process of doing so”.
The press secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Paul Jurek, admitted that the National Treasury Administration itself is monitoring a number of issues that may raise concerns.
"The National Treasure Administration acts in such a way that it has its own information, as well as based in a sense on information that is publicly available.
On this basis, it decides whether or not a specific matter should be followed," the MF spokesman explained.
"However, because all of us are in charge of the entire portfolio of finances, we never speak, because we cannot speak on individual matters of a particular taxpayer, a particular person or a particular company," he stressed, asking about Marian Banas.
Minister of Finance Jerzy Kwięciński stressed that "the financial institutions do not provide such a message to the public."
"It is known that the entire treasure apparatus deals with very many similar cases throughout the country," he said.
Royal family secrets: surprising guests often fly by a royal plane
As part of their duties of service, members of the royal family must spend their lives traveling hundreds of miles around the world.
This usually facilitates the royal plane – a private machine that drives the royal family around the world to important events and events.
It is no surprise that owning your own plane is a privilege.
The members of the royal family do not have to stand in long service lines, their limits on the number of luggage and, as it turns out, they may invite any guests on board – in this truly unique one.
According to the recent premiere of Channel 5 documentary film, not only the queen and Prince Philip often travel by royal plane.
During the programme entitled ‘King's Flight Secrets’, a former Queen's Flight Navigator revealed that fury visitors often flew along with the royal family.
Bob Shields said: "Sometimes, with our very important royal guests, the royal dogs could fly very important."
It is not surprising that the queen may wish her beloved loved ones to accompany her on her journeys, since she is known for her deep attachment to the dogs of the Corgia race.
For the youngest years, Queen Elizabeth has been a lover of these four - year - old creatures and have been hearing that since the coronation she has owned more than 30 corgia.
It is said that in 2007 she had five corgia: Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willow, and Holly.
They were joined by five cockers: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spik and Span, as well as four dogs who were the crosses of the Corgia warrant: Cider, Barry Vulcan and Candy.
The crew of the royal plane certainly had their hands full.
An employee of the royal dog - bringing home and asking them to arrange their needs before taking them on board the plane was seen, says Shields.
I'm glad to say that there's never been any incident.
The program also revealed the shocking number of luggage that the queen takes aboard during her journey as part of her service duties.
The film director stated: “In 1953, the queen took 12 tonnes of luggage on her journey of 70,000 kilometres.
To be able to visualize it better, it's about as much as two huge elephants.
But the queen is not the only person with a fashion weakness.
According to Princess Cambridge, she also has her own preferences for carrying her wardrobe – it is said that a separate seat is used for each of her dresses.
The new law is coming into force.
Injured in Accidents will receive rents
Friday comes into force by regulation providing seriously injured persons with further rent payment – the Financial Ombudsman informs.
It is the Act of 9 July 2019 on the special powers of the injured persons in the event of the exhaustion of the guarantee sum established under the provisions in force before 1 January 2006.
It concerns those who were injured before 1 January 2006.
At the time, the guarantee sums were definitely lower than they currently had, so in some cases the insurers had already ceased to pay rent.
"I am pleased with this regulation, because our institution has for many years sought to establish a mechanism that will allow for the provision of financial support to the seriously injured in accidents from communication OC insurance or OC to the farmer despite the exhaustion of the guarantee sum," says Alexander Dashewski, a legal adviser at the Office of the Financial Ombudsman.
In the opinion of the Financial Ombudsman, this was necessary because it is often very tragic situations involving people in very poor health who, for example, cannot work because of an accident and at the same time bear the significant costs of accidental rehabilitation treatment.
Some of them have no longer received a countervailable rent and increased needs due to the need for further treatment or rehabilitation due to the exhaustion of the so-called guarantee sums on OC policies.
Part of it threatened to happen in the coming years.
Until 1 January 2006, the liability limits of the insurer were significantly lower than the current ones.
That is why the problem of exhaustion of the guarantee sum in previous years was most often the case for those who suffered injury in the 1990s.
At the time, the guarantee sums were very low and economic conditions caused by price increases.
"We also noticed that the problem also affected a number of young people who suffered harm during the period when the sum amounted to €350,000 for each injured person.
At present, it is EUR 5.21 million per event, irrespective of the number of victims.
This is therefore a huge difference from earlier periods, so the problem required the intervention of the legislator," recalls Alexander Dashewski.
It explains that, since the guarantee sum was increased at some time, the legislator accepted that the upper limit of liability of the Insurance Guarantee Fund would be the guarantee sum in force at the time of the payment of the pension claim to the Fund.
This principle applies where the insurance undertaking is not obliged to pay the rent on the basis of a court ruling determining the amount of the guarantee other than that laid down in the OC Insurance Contract.
This is the case in the case of an increase in the judicial guarantee sum under Article 3571 of the Civil Code, which allows for the modification of the existing mandatory relationship.
“In recent days we have sent letters to people who in the past have asked us to intervene.
We keep them informed of the new powers and, of course, we provide opportunities for further support in the event of any problems arise," says Alexander Dashewski.

Brenda Barattini convicted for cutting off the boy's penis.
The case concerns the November 2017 events.
According to the Buenos Aires Times, it was then that Brenda Barattini found out that her boyfriend showed a friend the sex tape that was created in their bedroom.
A 28-year-old who is an architect of education explained to the court that his partner thus ruined her life and treated her like a "trophy" that you can boast of in front of your friends.
"He violated my intimacy, my life and my career.
It destroyed everything," she argued.
Cordoba's apartment decided to measure justice by itself.
She invited her boyfriend, 42-year-old Sergio F., to bed and told him she had prepared a special surprise.
She blindfolded him with an velvet belt, then grabbed him as an accelerant and cut his penis off.
"I felt like I was going to die.
I didn't see anything.
I tried to get up, I pulled up my pants and grabbed a cell phone to call 911," he testified to the injured man.
"I wanted to leave, but she started insulting me.
She grabbed my shirt and my hair, not letting me go," he added.
Although Barattini explained that her boyfriend had hurt her by exposing us to sex, she did not try to escape from responsibility.
"Please measure justice," she said in the direction of the jury.
She was finally found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to 13 years in prison.
Former Alabama State Congressman Jack Edwards died at the age of 91.
On Friday, Alabama retired Congressman Jack Edwards of the Republican Party, who served for 10 terms and belonged to the first wave of Republicans from the so-called Deep South.
The family spokesman said Edwards died in his house in Fairhope after fighting a pancreatic cancer.
Edwards was originally elected to the U.S. Congress in 1965 as one of the first republics of Alabama in the Deep South, thanks to the fact that the party gained supporters here.
He served 10 terms in Congress.
According to a statement by the family in response to a recent question about what the world would like to leave to its lawyers and lawyers, Edwards replied that he would like to return to kindness.
"I hope my lawyers and my lawyers will grow up in a country where there is a common debate and effort to resolve the country's problems will be restored with kindness," Edwards said, according to his family statement.
The state governor Alabama Kay Ivey said that Edwards served his country with the highest standards of honesty.
She added that on his honor the flag on the Alabama State Chapter would be abandoned to half the mast.
"He was the personification of a true state official and was the best husband of state for Alabama.
Our state has lost one of the most outstanding politicians," Ivey said in a statement.
Michelle Obama calls Meghan Markle "inspired" on Instagram
Michelle Obama expressed her appreciation for Meghan Markle on Instagram on Thursday, calling Princess Sussex "a pathetic leader who breaks the schematics and makes our world better."
The princess and Prince Harry, currently on a 10-week royal trip to South Africa with their son Arches Mountbatten-Windsor, participated in a meeting with young people at the beginning of this week, during which they met with leaders of the Obama Foundation.
"I would like to thank my friend, Her Royal Majesty, Princess Sussex @sussexroyal, "an anxious leader who breaks the schematics and makes our world better," wrote the first lady in her enthusiastic fast.
"Whether this is meeting with leaders of the Obama Foundation @ObamaFundation or helping girls around the world to gain access to the education they deserve is an inspiration for many people," Obama added, posting a picture of the smiling Meghan visiting with the Foundation leaders.
Meghan interviewed Obama for the September release of the British Vogue, hosted by the former actor of the "Suits" series.
In an honest conversation, the first lady was talking about motherhood and how it had changed her.
"Being a mother means leading to the art of forgiveness," Obama said in an interview.
"Maternity has taught me that for most of the time, it is my job to give children space to learn the world and become who they want to be.
Not what I want them to be or what I wanted to be at their age, but what I want them to be at their heart.
Obama, who knows from experience what the pressure of being at the candlelight is, shared with the Princess’s advice during an interview with Good Housekeeping magazine.
"The press you feel – imposed by yourself and others – can sometimes overwhelm you," she said.
"It is my advice, therefore, to slow down and not to rush into anything.
A few first months in the White House, I spent most of my life worrying about my daughter, making sure they were doing well in school and making new friends before I dedicated myself to more ambitious work.
I think it's necessary, too.
Hotel Trumpa retains a permit to sell alcohol despite a complaint about the owner's character
WASHINGTON (AP) – Washington's Commission for the Control of Alcoholic Drinks has dismissed an application seeking to verify whether Trump International Hotel's local facility should lose its liquor sales permit due to the owner's attitude.
The Agency ruled on Wednesday that the complaint of three pastors, two retired judges and two rabbis was groundless, because most of them did not live in the district or have no real estate in it.
"The Washington Post" states that for the second time these reasons have sought to withdraw the alcohol licence from the hotel, referring to the legislation in force in the district saying that the applicant for an alcohol licence must be “a good one”.
In the original complaint lodged last summer, President Donald Trump was found to be breaking the law, and accusations of assault and repeat cases of fraud were cited.
The complaint was dismissed because the licence was granted before it was lodged.
The reason for the second complaint was the extension of the licence.
‘The Sun’: The report finds the police scandal known in Cleveland as the worst in Britain
The Inspectors found the police the worst police in the United Kingdom to be Skompromitted SCANDALS.
In the crash report, they assessed the Cleveland police as inappropriate in all areas.
Phil Gormley of Her Majesty's National Police Inspectorate claims that the Cleveland Police Service has been "meaning deterioration" of standards.
New calls for police services have emerged, leading over six years to become five commanders.
According to the report, the police did not try to prevent crime, arrest suspects and protect the weakest.
Phil Gormley, of Her Majesty's Chief Police Inspectorate, said: “Since our last inspection, there has been a significant deterioration of standards.”
Commander Mike Veale resigned in January after a few years in the face of an investigation into "serious", though unpublished, charges concerning his conduct.
Deputy Commander Adrian Roberts was suspended after being arrested on charges of gross misconduct.
Last year, Inspector Simon Hurwood appeared before the Committee on Sexual Offences.
He's out of duty.
The mayor of Tees Valley Ben Houchen said of the tories: “It is official confirmation that these services are compromised.
It's time for the Home Office to intervene now."
Police Commander Richard Lewis said: "After improvements have been made, I take full responsibility for carrying out police forces by changes."
We have a skatepark visualization!
Are the young people finally waiting?
The elderly are hindered by the young passions for the hoolas and skaters, and they complain that there is no place for them in Olav.
For years, young people have known places to ride roller skates, skateboards, hulajnoch, bicycles.
The subject is still coming back to our lips.
We've been paying attention to this problem for 10 years.
The last time it came out loud again, there was no skatepark.
That's why we're going back to it and asking the office what's next?
We remind you that a few days ago, a woman was contacted who was interrupted by a youth driving downtown.
"I write on behalf of the people of the block near Pilsudski, so that the situation of the young people of Italy may be taken an interest," he writes to the edition of Małgorzata.
"The people of the block called the City Watch repeatedly for no effect.
To prove such daily situations in addition, I send pictures."
On the other hand, we have asked others about the matter.
Most clearly state that young people simply have no place to drive in the city and have been demanding their own space for years.
There was a line of comments on Facebook.
We already wrote in July that there was a chance that the skatepark would be built in the city of Olav.
The mayor informed us that the city had requested funding for the skatepark.
‘The project consulted with the young is ready, together with the permits.
On 28 March, an application was submitted to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism for funding the task of Budowa Skatepark in Olava under the programme Sportowa Poland, we were told at the office.
Total value of the project: PLN 798,306,00.
Amount of funding requested: PLN 263 440,00.
Now we've asked again at what stage the case is.
“We do not yet have information to decide on the application submitted to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism for funding”, says Elżbieta Bednarczyk, Head of the Department of European Funds UM Olaw.
“From the information obtained from the employees of the Ministry, it is clear that the final selection of all tasks under the Sportowa Programme of Poland should take place in October.”
We also asked for a visualisation of the Latvian skatepark.
We present it below.
The youth informed the editorial that they would be collecting signatures on a petition on the construction of a skatepark in Olav next Saturday (September 28th).
"The rebel youth saw the last post on Facebook and came to the conclusion that they would organize the collection," writes Santalaj.
The petition signatures will be collected from 12.00 p.m. near Lidl Market.
Polish Cup 2019/20: drawing 1/16 finals.
We know couples, hit years ago.
It was one of the toughest rivalries in the extraclasse.
The biggest legend was the memorable game of the 1996/1997 season.
On June 18, 1997, Legia took a team at the old stadium in Lazieńskowska, a boating team in the last row.
Both teams shared a point.
The masters had to win, the second in line of the Polish championship gave him a point.
Up to 87 minutes Legia led 2:0, but for five more minutes there was an earthquake – Videv shot three goals and rejoiced in the title.
The Łódź club has grown into more and more troubles for years, until it has ceased to count in the championship fight and has fallen from the top playing class.
For the last time, both teams met at this level in 2013/2014.
Legia – on the way to the title – took two victories – 5:1 at her home and 1:0 at the exit.
Back to the elite
Currently, boats are fighting to return to the national elite.
These plans were delayed by at least one year, since in previous games they were not able to advance to the extraclasses.
In the summer, however, the club was in a state-of-the-art revolution.
Powers have changed, Marcin Kaczmark was eventually placed on coach, and in taking another step up the club hierarchy to help repair the league fights Marcin Robak and Mateusz Mozdozn.
For the time being, Videv is the fourth in Table II of the League, but in the Polish Cup he defeated on Tuesday the vice-chair of the extraclasses Śląsk Wrocław 2:0.
The legion of the same size played at the exit of the Desert of Nięmomice.
Extraclasic start-up
The only couple made up of top class representatives in 1/16 finals make up ŁKS and Upper Zabrze.
The swords of this phase will take place from 29 to 31 October.
This year 1/8 finals were scheduled (December 3-5).
The final is scheduled to take place on 2 May at the National PGE in Warsaw.
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr “rebellioned” and the impeachment investigation must go through his path
You never know where we're going.
Now, in my opinion, we are involved in trying to hide the facts, and the investigation may take time," Pelosi said in an interview with the CNN on the Hill.
"They are doing the work they have started by sticking to the facts and time needed to find them," she added.
The protocol issued this week by the White House shows that Trump asked President Volodymyr Zelenski of Ukraine to conduct an investigation into former Vice-President Joe Biden, a candidate from 2020, and his son.
Trump also asked Zelenski to cooperate on this matter with Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, according to the protocol.
Trump denied doing anything wrong.
On Thursday, CNN reported that the National Security Lawyers of the Department of Justice had notified the complaint submitted by the teller concerning Trump’s handling of Ukraine more than a week before the formal application.
After receiving the complaint as a complaint from officials from Intelligence Community, the Department of Justice stated that the phone call of Trump did not provide a criminal investigation into the financing of the campaign.
Asked if Barr should testify, Pelosi said that on Friday, Intelligence Committee would decide who to call on a witness.
She added, however, that in her opinion, Barr “rebelliously rebelled. ”
It's been like this for a long time.
"The path (Barra) is exchanged in all this," Pelosi added, referring to Trump's reference to his attorney general during a July conversation with the leader of Ukraine.
Interestingly, he made decisions on how to deal with the complaint.
Pelosi announced that she was "very afraid" about the signalers Trump attacked on Thursday as spies, suggesting that they had been treated differently with spies in the past.
I think the President's words go beyond their responsibility is dangerous.
Our signalers play an important role in our discovery – the removal of violations in our government," Pelosi said, adding "The words of the President concerning those who can provide information seriously undermine the honesty of the government".
On Tuesday, Pelosi took a historic step towards a formal investigation into an illegal act based on allegations of attempts to pressure a foreign leader to gain political benefits.
The phone call was included in the complaint published on Thursday, in which the signaler claimed that Trump had abused his power to "inculcate Ukraine into interference" during the upcoming elections 2020.
The signalist also claimed that the White House lawyers had officials remove the record of the conversation from the computer system in which they were kept for the purposes of the officials of the Council of Ministers and put it in a system intended for sensitive information.

Possible ban on driving cars for excessive speed for the attacker of Crystal Palace Christiana Bentke
The Premier League Star to Christian Bentke, who has been caught twice in the last two months in excess of speed, is threatened with a ban on driving vehicles.
The attacker Crystal Palace, 28 years old, admitted to driving by Bentley's car at a speed of 80 miles per hour on the ground with a limit of up to 50 miles per hour on the A3 road in Richmond in southwest London on 20 January.
Then, in March, photoradiaries in Putney in southwest London registered Belga driving at 89 miles per hour, which is a two-fold limit of 40 miles per hour.
The Bentke of Kingston Hill of Surrey doesn't have to stand up in Court of Peace at Lavender Hill this morning.
He confessed to both cases in early July under a simplified procedure on the basis of which the lighter offences were tried at a meeting held by one judge of peace.

Ghana: Kofi Manu Concerned by the Structure of the Review Committee
Kofi Manu, a football manager and a representative of the Sekondi Hasasacas club, raised doubts about the composition of the Verification Commission for upcoming elections to the National Football Union in Ghana (GFA).
He questioned the inclusion of the President of the Commission, Frank Davies, adding that he was not satisfied with his participation.
In his interview with GNA Sport Manu, he expressed doubts as to whether the President of the Commission would be fair because the outcome of the verification process was in his interest.
The verification committee should consist of neutral outsiders who do not have links with any of the members and who have not previously shown interest.
For example, Davies was employed by the NC as a lawyer who wrote to Osei Kwaku Palmer for a 10 percent payment.
He is also a well-known advocate of the Olympic Games.
For these two reasons, it should not be allowed to take a position in the Verification Commission because it has an interest in this," he said.
Manu said that if, before the Commission, Fred Papie, Director of the Olympic Games, there would be a conflict of interest on the part of the President because of his connections with the club, suggesting that, at the same time, before the Commission, Palmer would be subject to prejudice and bias.
The Commission members were expected to start their work from yesterday, after the ceremony at the GFA Secretariat in Accra on Tuesday, 19 September, and end it on 4 October.
The President of the Commission shall be Frank Davies, and her members shall be a consultant for corporate governance and lawyer, Mrs Marian Barnor and Mr Emmanuel Darkwah.
Other members include Reginald Larryea, Marketing and Business Director and Richard Akpokavie, Sport Administrator and Lawyer.
‘SE’: Kornel Morawiecki is in severe condition at the hospital
Senior Marshal Kornel Morawiecki, a legend of Solidarity and the father of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, returned to the hospital – informs Super Express.
Politics is hard to deal with.
The 78-year-old Corneal Morawiecki has been struggling with pancreatic cancer for many months.
He's been feeling better lately.
According to Super Express, during the last interview with a newspaper that took place two weeks ago, the senior marshal was “in a great form”.
But now the health of the prime minister’s father has deteriorated considerably.
Kornel Morawiecki went to the hospital, and the doctors say his condition is severe.
The senior marshal's family told the "SE" that politics is conscious and fully aware.
Pancreatic cancer is not the only disease that has been dealt with by the Moravian Cornelius.
He's also having heart problems, and he's also having kidney chemo.
Kornel Morawiecki is running this year's parliamentary elections for the term of office of the senator in the letter Pis in Podlasia.

Israel: No Agreement on a Unity Government · Global Voices
The two main parties of Israel, the Blue-White Alliance and the Liquid, continued negotiations on Friday to establish a unity government.
The meeting, which was held after the President's mission to form Benjamin Netanyahu's government, failed to produce results.
The talks discussed the possibility of the rotational leadership of both parties in the government and of Netanyahu being Prime Minister, but, as the Israeli daily Haarec writes, there was no convergence of views.
The talks will resume on Sunday.
The Central Alliance of Blue-White informed in the Communication that it had submitted preliminary proposals.
The claim of the right-wing Likud that he “kept digging in his position” demanding that his leader and current prime minister, Netanyahu, remain in the lead of the government and, as part of the cabinet, the former ultra-orthodox politician.
"From the very beginning it was known that Blue-Biali would not agree to these conditions," the message published by them said.
For the liquid, acting solely in the interests of Netanyahu, wants to “bring Israel to the second round of elections”.
The leader of Blue-White Benny Gantz refuses to support the government he would run Netanyahu as long as he is charged with participating in three corruption affairs, on the basis of which the prosecutor could formally charge him after Wednesday's meeting.
"Liquid and Blue-Biali won a sufficient majority in the 17 September elections that would allow them to join governments as natural allies, but this forces them to negotiate which none of the parties wanted," writes the EFE.
President Reuwen Rivlin has been trying to bring their positions closer in the last days and has proposed the creation of a "rolling board", suggesting that the Prime Minister temporarily suspend his functions, allowing Gantz to take this position if the accusations against Netanyahu were upheld and formalized.
There is no lack of Israeli analysts who believe that matters have been committed in a dead end.
However, half of the Israelis, according to a poll published on Friday by public television, want to unlock the political situation in the country by establishing a government of unity under rotating leadership for the transformation of Netanyahu and Gantz.
This is followed by 50.6% of Israelis, 32.1% of those surveyed object to such a solution.
The survey shows a deep division in Israel’s society – the question of who should first head the office, 41.8 percent of respondents favour Netanyahu, and 40% behind Gantz.
In another poll published by Israel Hajom, the percentage of supporters of the unity government rises to 63%, 60% are against new elections that would be third this year.
In the early parliamentary elections on 17 September, Ganza won 33 seats in the 120-seat duke, the Netanyahu Likud won 32 seats.
Netanyahu with his traditional and potential allies can count on the support of 55 Members, while Gantz can count on 54.
None of the parties have obtained 61 mandates, which are necessary for the majority.
Tipuric calls for a fight before the final game with Australians
Justin Tipuric says that "this is the time to check" when Wales faces the final game with Australia in the context of the World Cup, which can shape their fate in the tournament.
Valia's victory over the "kangures" would set this team in the position of a favorite to win Group D and guarantee itself a possible quarter-final meeting with France or Argentina.
However, if Australia defeats Wales 14th in the last 15 meetings, Tipuric and his team will be quickly sent to the start of England in one eighth of the finals.
"Let's be clear, the two teams want to try to get through this and get to the top of the group," said the Welsh fighter Tipuric.
There have been some difficult results in the past, but last autumn it was nice to win with them (Australia).
I think they're going to be eager to take this victory away from us, and we need to take it back.
Before we got here, you knew it was gonna be a big start.
And now we're here and this is really time to check it out.
Wales only won one victory over Australia, New Zealand or South Africa in the history of the World Cup – and this took place 32 years ago in a third place in the match when they defeated the Kangaroos.
And their total record under the lead coach Warren Gatland shows only seven victories in 41 attempts to beat three heavyweight teams from the southern hemisphere.
Valia represented a string of thirteen failed test matches from Australia in November last year, and Tipuric prepared to be among those few saved from the 9-6 win that will run to Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
Tipuric, who asked if the team had experienced mental blockade before winning it, said: “It’s hard to say.
These matches are so flattened that maybe... people are expecting to have a mental blockage, I don't know.
At the end of the last match, we probably left about 15 points on the field, so the final score looks a lot smaller than it actually was.
If Walia triumphs, then the fight of Tipurica with the beloved Australian duo from the third line of the mill by Michael Hooper and David Pococ during the arrest and the fall will be essential.
Tipuric played 67 meetings in the color of the team and met with both players on several previous occasions, so he knows exactly what's waiting for him.
"These are the players playing in the position of the seventh absolute world class," he said.
When you play against the world-class third-line players, you always know that the game will be hard to play.
These two are always with the best players in the world.
You know what kind of game you can expect.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world playing defensively, and Michael is a more attacking seven and probably feeling better rugby because he is always in the right place at the right time.
It's better to play against the best players in the world and challenge themselves than to face a third line of mill that's not so good.
It's worth playing against the best, and when you're struggling with these two, you certainly have to be in top form.
I wouldn't say that Sunday is almost the end of the Cup, but for us it's an important game in this World Cup.
Impet is an important element.
When we build strength and put forth constant effort, we will fly like wings and be hard to beat.
EastEnders: Ben kisses Callum after sensational news from Whitney
The tension between Callum Highway (Tony Clay) and Ben Mitchell (Max Bowden) will once again be over in the East Enders series, when a sudden message from Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) completely surprises Callum and makes him fall into the arms of a loved one.
Will it be the beginning of their relationship, or will they regret this moment of abduction?
Since Callum helped save Ben's life, and then supported Bobby Beale (Clay Milner Russell), they took no time with Ben, but considered going out together – Callum recently told Ben that he was pleased that he could get to know his sensitive and milder face.
Tonight Whitney will be back from vacation in a better mood than when she was leaving.
It was good for her to leave Walford after their terrible wedding and discover that her husband was cheating on her.
When he comes home, he's having an honest conversation with Callum.
He's getting a message that shakes him.
Callum reacts badly to her and looks at a glass in Queen Vic's pub, which is dead to Jay Mitchell.
The drunk and emotional Callum goes to Ben and blames him for everything that's happened.
The calm Ben understands his explosion and tries to comfort Callum, soon the frustration of Callum turns into passion when a couple share a kiss.
How do you do that?
The couple are planning a date next week, but Ben's thinking about their relationship may be threatening everything they've been working on so far.
Callum, who once again believed in himself, after opposing his homophobic father, is determined to fight for what he wants and what he deserves.
Watch the EastEnders kiss on Friday at 8:30 on Friday at the BBC One.
The book premiere.
"Waffen-SS" Jochen Boehler, Robert Gerwarth, Jacek Mlynarczyk
They were meant to be an elite organization of the "young race".
They accepted in their ranks those whom they despised.
Is crime more powerful than national identity?
In your hands, we don't give another book about war or military affairs.
We are giving a deep international study on the participation of non-Germans in Waffen-SS.
Historians from different European countries have analysed the attitude and motivation of volunteers, reminded of their activities and watched recruitment processes at different stages of the war.
Did the Danish troops differ from the French?
Where did Ukrainian enthusiasm come from?
Why didn't you create a unit made up of Poles themselves?
What is today the official historical narrative of collaboration in individual European countries?
What happened to the volunteers after the war ended?
Among these questions is the book ‘Waffen-SS’ based on solid research material.
We have tried to present a more subtle and balanced, closer picture of collaboration in Europe during the second world war, also trying to break the methodological boundaries of historical history and the period of events through the presentation of the authorship hearings of researchers from various countries. (...) If the fate of the main victims of this war - forced workers, Jews, prisoners, political opponents of Nazi Germany, the Slovenian population - are sometimes presented in comparative terms and/or supranational terms, then the perpetrators are examined essentially from the national perspective (as far as this is concerned).
“Total panic”, when the White House fights to find arguments about impeachment
Officials from the White House are stunning to figure out how to resist the pressure on the impeachment on Thursday, and one of the interviewers familiar with the situation describes the feeling of "total panic" felt last week due to the lack of a response plan to the new reality.
This seems to contribute to "anxiety, uncertainty and concern" – one of the people associated with the White House describes the mood in the western wing – that the allegations of the informant could seriously harm the president and the people around him.
She said: “There is little certainty that nothing is hidden there. ”
Officials of the White House were still uncertain about how to proceed, not only because there is no obvious plan of action in this situation, but also because the charges are so serious that the standard methods of effective avoidance of controversy used by the President in the past may not work. "This does not seem to pass away with the emergence of another series of headlines" – this person complained.
Another speaker described the atmosphere in the White House as “a state of shock” accompanied by growing distrust that, along with an ongoing impeachment investigation, the likelihood of the president answering in an irresponsible way becomes “hard to control”.
This fear is shared by another interviewer, who claims that the President's people are predicting that he will show a more "frequent" behaviour, and the pressure put on him will certainly begin to increase with each day of the impeachment investigation.
This raises concerns that Trump can present increasingly unpredictable behaviour and erupt in an unexpected way – this is in the context of the electoral year of concern both from the perspective of the Presidency and the elections.
Faced with the greatest threat in the presidency so far, Trump circled from the attack to the defence, once again reaching for a strategy which he considered to be effective during Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia.
He tried to enrich his own request to the Ukrainian president for assistance in the investigation of his political rivals in order to distract and direct her to the actions of Democrats and Democratic candidate Joe Biden and to discredit the informant as a party-led activist.
But while many people in the White House are being repaired in the fight after Mueller's investigation, this time something has changed – counsellors and consultants said.
The president, whose exploratory character is the force, presented the Wednesday press conference as a defeatist – said one of the people familiar with the situation.
While Trump enthusiastically accepted questions about the Russian investigation, he seemed unwilling to answer questions about Ukraine – they said.
Some of the President's allies believe that harm can be avoided, and some of them hold out the fact that the informant did not know firsthand about this controversial phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenski – which, according to them, undermines his credibility.
And how often this happens when the president is an object of attack, this fact is raised alive by his main supporters in his defense.
But one of the Republican strategists associated with the White House indicates that the results of the presidential support polls are incredibly high, and the impeachment will not affect the acquisition of new sympathies too much.
"There is no positive need to focus on the President's impeachment in the next four months", especially if this makes its legislative programme difficult and predominates in the new series of headlines.
Another interviewer claims that those who maintained that impeachment would help the president did not fully understand how unpredictable his reaction would be.
Concerned White House officials were looking for help with advisers, putting together an impeachment response team.
According to the person who is aware of the plans, given that these efforts are early, it remains unclear whether any command centre initiative will be taken and what form it can take.
This person has stated that there is a conviction that a coordinated legal-communication strategy is required with a strong leader able to carry out a PR attack, which is a rift on the publication of a eloquent signaller report, with a view to halting the disengagement of democratic actions on the impeachment given by the disclosure of this report.
The interviewer, familiar with the situation, maintains that the lack of a long-term strategic vision was clear when State Secretary Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin stated that they did not intend to disclose a note describing Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president, and then 48 hours later it was felt that there was no way out and a document needed to be published.
It is expected that now the pressure will be greater than in the course of Robert Mueller's investigation, who mostly kept quiet and spoke only through accusations. One of the people who may be involved in the elaboration of an impeachment response is Corey Lewandowski, a man from Trumpa's dirty work and former chief of the election staff – said the person involved.
However, Lewandowski told NBC News that it was not true to suggest that he would direct this action.
"For the last five years, I have done everything I could to support the president and his program," he said, but I did not participate in any discussions with the president or his team about joining the team to resist the false narrative of the impeachment."
Private lawyer Donald Trump from Mueller's investigation, Jay Sekulow, also remains involved in impeachment activities.
"We respond to the issues as appropriate" – Sekulov replied when he was asked by NBC News to comment.
The White House is currently experiencing a lack of a lawyer experienced in the field of impeachment, after Emmet Flood, who worked with Clinton's impeachment and advised the White House at the end of Mueller's investigation, left, and the present advisor, Pat Cipollonone, has no such experience.
The interviewer, familiar with the White House strategy, said that the officials in general were at no time planning to involve people or create a command centre, but acknowledged that the need for a coordinated, joint response and a possible political battle were needed.
The explorer Explorer of the Seas line Royal Caribbean has been repaired by £89 million
An expert of the Seas belonging to the Royal Caribbean International family will travel this summer on a cruise presenting a completely new look.
After the renewal, which absorbed an impressive $110 million (89 million) pound, the ship delights in a wide selection of culinary dishes from all over the world and a wide range of entertainment for the whole family.
This summer, Explorer will stop at the most excellent ports in Italy and Greece, allowing passengers to feel the taste of Mediterranean Europe.
When the adventure of the land ends, the crew of the ship promises unforgettable seaside impressions.
Having a satisfaction offer for everyone, the Explorer, after renovations of $110 million, about £89 million, turned into a passenger ship providing excellent entertainment for the whole family.
Impressive technology means that passengers can surf on board with advanced surfing simulators or watch a favorite family movie using the charms of the weather in a outdoor cinema.

The tour operator stated: “Explorer of the Seas is the fourth Voyager class ship to undergo the transformation of the Royal Amplified fleet.”
The programme, which requires more than $1 billion of investment, comprising 10 ships and lasting four years, improves every aspect of customer satisfaction and introduces a wide range of opportunities: from unique attractions and night experiences.
Devin Nunes accuses the Democrats of demanding “the naked photos of Trump”
Apparently, Congressman Devin Nunes of California can't stand the naked truth that President Donald Trump's investigation is under way.
In his Thursday defense, the president accused the Democrats of wanting to get naked photos of the president.
Nunes, a high-ranking Republican representative of the Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives, made the above plea in the opening statement during the hearing on the basis of a signalling complaint, as if Trump had asked Ukraine for assistance in initiating an investigation against the Democratic candidate for President Joe Biden and his son.
The Congressman called the Ukrainian scandal a "grotesque performance" of the leftist and their "median ace" before he said that the Democrats wanted to see pictures of the president in negligic.
"The Democrats in this committee have been negotiating with people who say they were Ukrainians to get naked photos of Trump," Nunes said.
"People can rightly ask why the Democrats are so determined to charge the president when they have a chance in a year's time.
When Nunes finished giving reprimands, political reporter HuffPost, Jennifer Bendery, decided to see if the Democrats really were trying to... find out.
So far, only the representative of Connecticut, Jim Himes, has answered, although we suspect that his answer is a naked truth, confirming the thoughts of many of his colleagues and colleagues.
The Mediaite.com portal suspects that Nunes's nudity comments refer to "a certain more frenzy and unconfirmed information", which is likely to appear in the controversial Steele acts,
It is famous, gathered by former British spy Christopher Steele, a collection of charges against Trump, indicating the probability of a tape that shows him watching the giving power of a prostitute in a hotel room in Moscow.
Potential research on renewable biofuels can help reduce emissions
While in recent years electric cars and Semi Tesla have dominated information services, one issue seems to be the diversion of renewable energy – airplanes.
However, a professor at the University of Alberta developed a technology that would enable renewable biofuels to be used as an aviation fuel.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at the University of Alberta at the Department of Agriculture, Life and Environment, who started working on this project in 2003.
Its laboratory develops hydrocarbon fuels derived from fatty wastes such as restaurant fats, animal fats and rape oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology may use lower-quality oils during production, resulting in an estimated 85% lower carbon emissions than for petroleum fuels, as well as waste from other industries.
This technology is designed to mimic hydrocarbons present in petroleum fuels.
"What our technology has done in the first generation," Bressler said, "is [in sum of the creation] of hydrocarbons which are identical particles like diesel fuel."
While this opens up a new possibility of using biofuels, previously developed biofuels tended to destabilise at lower temperatures, which posed a serious threat to large-scale aeroplanes.
"The problem with air fuel is a bit wrong," Bressler said.
It's actually less valuable than diesel, but it has higher requirements.
The Bressler laboratory is currently looking at two options for the production of aviation biofuels.
The first option is a low-risk approach, which requires additional treatment of hydrocarbon biofuels and the addition of hydrogen.
The second option is to continue working on chemical properties already developed that will ensure fuel stability, even at low temperatures.
"We can experiment with chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a little," Bressler said, commenting on the second option.
This option is more risky.
The spray company set up by the University of Alberta, Forge Hydrocarbons, is working on the commercialisation of the product, as airlines, as well as the Canadian and American armies, increase investment in the renewable option.
"They are able to imagine times in which a reversal of the situation can occur and carbon tax will be imposed on them," he said.
They want an alternative instead, which will be an emergency plan.
Forge is currently running a pilot plant near the Edmonton Waste Management Centre and has recently received a total of $4 million from Lockheed Martin in support of a $25 million production plant that will be located in Sombra, Ontario.
It is expected that the plant will produce about 19 million gallons [19 million L] of biofuels annually.
Bressler also notes that the projected reduction in coal will be about 85 percent, but issues such as transport and fuel production will stop further carbon reduction.
"As a technology specialist," Bresler said,
I have the task of developing options that allow informed decisions and many choices."
SUPPORT: Another Grandmother Fraud
Eight thousand zlotys and 750 euros lost Zamostia's apartment thinking that she was helping her grandson who caused the accident.
The police reported the incident on Thursday, the son of a conundrum.
"The woman was called on Wednesday by a man who pretended to be her grandson.
He said he caused an accident and needed money.
Otherwise, he's going to jail.
In order to help her grandson, she handed 8 thousand zlotys and 750 euros to a false police officer who came to her home," relates Mr. Dorota Krukowska-Bubilo of the Zamy Police Department.
The police are looking for the perpetrator and once again they ask for caution:
‘Every telephone with a request for financial assistance should be verified.
Do not act under the influence of emotion or in haste.
Remember, the cops don't ask for money and don't take money.
If we receive a call asking for financial support that will arouse our suspicions, you should respond immediately and inform the police by calling 911.
We also appeal to younger family members.
Let's talk to our seniors about threats, let's talk about how frauds work.
Let us ask for caution and not trust those who call and ask for a loan."
The allies of Prime Minister Boris Johnson warn that if the British braxitis is withdrawn, there is a threat of riots such as in Los Angeles, and he is calling for peace.
One of the main ministers of the cabinet said last night that the country was threatened with a "stoll social breakdown" if the original result was challenged by the outcome of the second referendum.
The British Prime Minister's allies in his immediate surroundings warned that the country was threatened by social unrest on the scale of protests by the "yellow vests" in France due to social inequalities and riots in Los Angeles in 1992.
Johnson called for a “satisfaction of mood” during a violent debate over the policy language, but stressed that he would not stop using the word “to surrender”.
Despite his cry for peace, the Minister of the Cabinet said: “There have never been protests in this country such as the ‘gilets jaunes’ demonstrations (the yellow vests) or residence in Los Angeles in 1992.
People think it's impossible, just because they didn't happen before.
Now they have an example – gilets jaunes – use encrypted phones to coordinate the pickets, and to push people to protest, just a few inflexible populist leaders.
Residents in Los Angeles erupted after the jury acquitted four white police officers who beat up black cab driver Rodney King in 1992.
This year, anti-government demonstrators in France wearing yellow retro-reflecting vests – the jaune guillet – have been emptying and destabilizing the streets of Paris for more than six weeks.
The Minister referred to the warning given by Johnson in the Gmin Chamber and said that if the UK fails to leave the EU, there will be "a catastrophic loss of confidence in our political system".
"If we organise a referendum in which 30 million people will vote, 66% of them will speak for Britain's remaining in the European Union, ten million citizens will be dissatisfied," the minister said.
Even if this result ignores 99% of them, we will have 100,000 angry people who will write to their messenger and who will not forgive.
Not many need to see a few thousand people on the street soon.
One of the main ministers of the Cabinet added that the country would be threatened with a "serious social breakdown" if the outcome of the first referendum was challenged by the outcome of the second.
Johnson called for the organization of universal elections in which voters should decide on the fate of the brilliance.
According to reports, the prime minister faces the risk of rebellion of a cabinet seeking to lower demands for bruxite and achieve a compromise agreement with the EU.
Cattle, Chubówna and Krosny got caught up in Krakow.
Follow us Talk'N'Roll
More than 300 participants listened on Thursday (September 26th) to 11 inspiring presentations by speakers, including Simon Holovnia, Krystyna Chubovna and Ireneusz Krosny.
This is all part of the Talk'N'Roll conference, which was held in Krakow for the fifth time.
Talk'N'roll 2019
Expanding horizons, talking about ideas worthy of publicity and joint discussions that may become an impetus for further development.
This was the goal set by the organizers of the Talk'N'Roll conference, inviting 11 special speakers, representing very diverse sectors and areas of interest, including the media known to Simon Hogovina, Krystyna Chubovna and Ireneus Krosny.
The slogan of this year's edition of Talk'N'Roll was "Crafting the Future, NOW" and around the creation of the future focused on the appearance of guests invited to attend the conference.
The first session was opened by the Managing Director of Sabre Polska, Sebastian Drzewiecki, who spoke about how the brand that is being built around him could affect our future.
Richard Lucas took the stage to change public perception of the phenomenon of rejection, claiming that it should be accepted if the future is to be created, Chris Badura, in turn, addressed the issue of empathy at the time of the rapid development of technology.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP Sabre) shared insights and techniques that can help to manage careers and increase overall satisfaction by finding a proper balance between professional and private life.
The second part of the conference opened a wide-ranging conversation with Krystyna Chubówna, who spoke about, inter alia, how from her perspective over the years the profession of a lecturer in Poland changed.
The owner of one of the most popular voices in the country admitted that, thanks to technology development, everyone today can struggle with this profession.
However, he does not think that, in the coming years, a person in his position as a speaker would be completely replaced by technology.
After that, Peter Nabielec took up the problem of life during the overwork of information, emotional or overburdening of choice, giving the audience valuable tips on how to deal with it, and Lukasz Łętocha in his speech talked about what another industrial revolution, known as "Industry 4.0", could lead to.
Enjoying the Lessons Learning From Fun
The organizers of the conference also took care of artistic impressions, inviting the stage of an illusionist, Daniel Odinak.
The third part of the conference was opened by Ireneusz Krosny, who first played with pantonim, and then, on his own career, discussed how he tried to maintain the right balance between his career on stage and his private life.
Simon Holovnia also kidnapped the participants with his speech, highlighting first and foremost the role of time in our lives.
The publicist pointed out that even two minutes can diametrically change the situation and you need to be ready to take advantage of this time.
He also shared his thoughts on the reality surrounding us, calling on an anecdotes that could make us smile on the faces of the viewers.
The scene was followed by Adrian Tworuszka, who reviewed the history and objectives of several innovation models and referred them to how they are currently being used.
At the end of Marcin Słowiak, for example, Rubik's cube, he described the approach to solving problems.
Each of the 11 speakers certainly brought something new into the perception of the reality of all who had the opportunity to watch the performances, and the natural reactions and many questions to the guests show a great deal of commitment from the audience.
The organizers provided a transmission for all who could not personally participate in the event and the recordings from the lecture are available on the website.
Government law rather than rule of law.
"Despite the lack of sufficient votes to amend the Constitution, the ruling majority has made a number of changes in the state system, posing a threat to the rule of law and the principle of the tri-division of power", the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights writes in its report on Thursday.
The “Governments of Law in lieu of the rule of law” report documents, inter alia, developments in justice and the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.
On Thursday, the Helsinki Human Rights Foundation (HFPC) published a report entitled “Governments in Law Instead of Rule of Law.
Threats to the protection of human rights in Poland 2015-2019".
The Foundation estimates in the report that between 2015 and 2019 there was the biggest crackdown in the field of human rights protection in Poland after 1989.
"Despite the lack of sufficient votes to amend the Constitution, the ruling majority has made a number of changes in the state system, threatening to protect the rule of law and the principle of three-division of power.
By adapting the law to political objectives, governments have been replaced by the rule of law", writes HFPC experts.
What about the HFPC report?
The report documents developments in the functioning of justice, independent institutions (such as the media or the Ombudsman) and in the area of the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including freedom of assembly, women's rights, the rights of LGBT and the right to a fair process).
The report also summarises the ongoing dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union over three years.
"In the last four years, for the first time and on such a scale, we have observed the use of the right to realize the partial interests of the party.
This has been translated into an ongoing crisis of the rule of law, as well as to weaken the entire system of human rights protection in Poland", stressed lawyer Marcin Wolny, one of the authors of the report.
Protection of human rights
As indicated in the report, the last four years are “the period of systemic change both in the country” and “with regard to the protection of human rights”.
Over the past four years, the Sejm has adopted more than 20 key pieces of legislation for the protection of human rights.
"The changes were often adopted at an accelerated pace, without social consultation and despite legal concerns, the Ombudsman or international organisations," explained lawyer Małgorzata Szęk, co-author of the report.
According to the report, the main trends observed over the past four years are: “the weakening of independent institutions (including courts and prosecutors), the disregard of binding judgments of courts and recommendations of international institutions and the weakening of guarantees of human rights protection”.
The authorities did not respond.
In particular, the Helsinki Human Rights Foundation has found “these situations in which the authorities have not reacted or ignored the emerging cases of aggression”.
The Foundation experts noted that certain changes were introduced in the atmosphere of attacks on individual institutions or groups or groups exposed to discrimination.
The Foundation indicates that the result of state activity in the area of the restriction of the rule of law is the ongoing dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union, as well as a number of recommendations from international law actors.
"The lack of implementation of these recommendations not only weakens the position of Poland as the leader of democratic change in the Central and Eastern Europe region, but also undermines the Polish state's responsibility for violating European Union law or the European Convention on Human Rights," we read in the report.
Brother of Pakistani social media with a lifetime of honour killing
Women's rights experts argue that the investigation of justice is often difficult because of the continuing conduct, the release of suspected murderers for bail and the suppression of cases in public awareness.
"It takes so long for people to forget," says Farzana Bari, defenders of women's rights and founders of the first gender college in Pakistan at the university, and adds that even the widely publicized case of Baloch's murder has been resolved for more than three years.
Although it is difficult to establish reliable data according to women's rights groups, the Pakistani Human Rights Commission in 2018 stated at least 300 cases of so-called honour killings.
Many activists claim that the actual number is much higher, and the network promoting awareness of honour crimes estimates that in Pakistan about one fifth of the 5,000 honour killings committed every year worldwide.
Record earnings of Poles abroad
However, the country's messages are getting smaller because many migrants are staying outside of Poland permanently – says the Friday "Rzeczpospolita".
The latest Euro-Tax report shows that the average earnings of Poles working in other countries in Europe amounted to more than PLN 8.6% in 2018, which means that they increased by almost a thousand zlotys, which is almost 12%.
Euro-Tax “estimates that the total income of Polish workers in the EU countries reached a record of PLN 154.5 billion in 2018, one of seven more than a year earlier”, we read.
Director of the Centre for Research on Migration of the University of Warsaw, Paweł Kaczmarczyk says that Poles are increasingly better off in the international labour market, where they use different options available.
"There is also an increase in the number of professionals who are moving from country to country in search of better conditions, as well as international corporations," the newspaper reports.
Some Euro-Tax customers work within a year in two countries, e.g. the UK and Germany.
"It was in RFN most in 2018, because by 11%, the total earnings of Polish emigrants increased (up to nearly PLN 27 billion).
The Poles, however, made the most of it on the Islands – almost 35 billion PLN", we read on.
The President of Euro-Tax believes that despite improving working conditions in the Polish market, the number of Euro-Tax migrants is not decreasing.
Because Saxons in the West and the North of Europe (in charge of Norway) are often more likely than in Poland.
"Even at minimum rates in a given country, which, for example, in Germany amounts to 9.5 to 11.7 euros per hour," the daily reports.
The "Rzeczpospolita" says that Poles remain not only because of higher earnings, but also because they settled abroad.
Many Poles are leaving behind roots, which can also be seen after the small remittances to the country.
Those last year were the lowest in years.
As economist Tadeusz Krysticki recalls, with the extension of the period of stay abroad, a smaller group of people transferring money to the country and their height is reduced.
“Emmigrants draw close to one another,” we read in Friday’s “Rzeczpolite”.
Prolonged monsoons cause floods and chaos in many regions of India
The monsoon season in India has been going on for almost a month, and the unprecedented rainfall has resulted in death due to the collapse of buildings and gnocium of many crops.
Normally, in northern India, monsoon declines at the beginning of September, but the average rainfall this month exceeded the standard by 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Department, if this situation continues for the next few days, it will be the latest monsoon in decades.
In many areas of the country, the rainfall is still unprecedented – recently in India’s western town of Pune Wednesday and Thursday’s rains have resulted in the deaths of several hundred people and the devastation of buildings.
There was a flood of homes, people barfed across the streets in the water on their knees, which is normally only happening during the apogeum monsoon.
The great rainfall also occurred in cities such as Calcutta, Lucknow and Hajdarabad.
The long - lasting rains in the north state of Uttarakhand destroyed many homes.
Monsoon also started late.
Water was scarce in many areas, so farmers were preparing for a likely drought.
Too long-lasting monsoon is not welcome by farmers.
This amount of rain is not normal at this time of year.
"By it my vegetables – and now I have cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes – will rot," says Prakash Mehra, a farmer from a small farm in Bhimtal, Uttarakhand.
For consumers, the delayed and late end effects of monsoon mean an increase in the price of onions, i.e. an indispensable component of Indian food.
Onion, which was usually paid 20 rupees (0.23 UK pounds), currently costs 80 rupees (about 1 UK pound) per kilogram in cities such as Delhi and Bombay.
Festivals and holidays are also at stake.
The next big festival is the 8th of October celebration of Dasar, during which the Hindus carry huge hooks, such as from the comic book, presenting Ravana, the figure of the lush mustache and the vicious smile of the "Ramajana" episode.
Ravana's burning symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.
However, given that Ravana's similarity was made of paper, if the monsoon continues, then Ravana will laugh at the last.

NARRATOR: Giant plum!
She grew up in the yard.
Maria Magdalene Popek of the Mountain Putnovice sent us a picture of this huge plumbing.
Purchawa grew up in our reader's yard.
It looks like it's only gonna be measured tonight.
It's on Google's 21st birthday down the road.
It would be hard to imagine a world without Google today.
In the search engine, we're looking for answers to all of our troubling questions.
What are we looking for on Google?
"What is this?", "Where?", "How?" and "How much?" is one of the favorite categories that Poles have found.
The giant figures show that last year we were eager to ask, among other things, "Where is the storm?", "How do you make the blades?" and "How many fingers does a horse have?", "How do you get rid of the fruit fly?", "How do you eat some?".
Today the search engine celebrates its 20th birthday.
Its users – and in Poland up to 96% of people use Google's Uncle – welcome to a special Google Doodle today.
He's not animated this time.
Google recalls its birthday by showing a fixed computer with a monitor, mouse and keyboard, and in the lower right corner printed a digital date – as in the picture from the 1990s.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
The search engine was created for a specific purpose – it was intended to catalogue all possible information and make it available via the Internet.
Her name is a wordplay.
It comes from the mathematical term googol indicating the number of tens raised to the power of the centenary.
The name was also intended to reflect the intention of the company to index as many sites as possible from the world's Internet resources.
A Google searcher was founded by Sergei Brin and Larry Page in 1996 as part of their student project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of the relationship between the parties that worked better than the usual segregation methods based on the frequency of the phrase.
In the beginning, the search engine was called BlackRub, referring to the English word blacklink, which means the number of links to the result.
Page and Brin established a company operating under Google Inc. on September 7, 1998, and soon launched the famous Google.com website.
What's next, Google?
In December 1998, the "PC Magazine" published information about the extremely correctness of Google's search results.
Then the company's history looks almost like a fairy tale - rapid development with each month, the theft of subsequent markets and the enhancement of the company's values.
Already in June 2000, Google's URL index has over a billion entries, making Page and Brin's work the largest search engine in the world.
At present, the company founded by Page and Brin is one of the leading players in the IT market.
So is there any other development field?
"The mission of Google is to organise global information resources to be widely available and useful, although we have made great progress in this field, it is still a very long way to reach this goal," Peter Zalewski of Google Poland spoke to Newsweek.
Frequent contact with pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke
A new study suggests that working with exposure to high concentrations of plant protection products may translate into a high risk of heart disease in later years of life.
This is the case with a group of Japanese Americans in Hawaii who have been studied for over 30 years.
Scientists have determined that, compared to men who did not work with plant protection products, those who had the greatest contact with them were 45% more likely to be heart disease or stroke.
"This study underlines the need to use personal protection equipment for time of contact with pesticides at work and the importance of registering in medical documentation contact with such measures at work, as well as to control standard factors that increase the incidence of heart disease," said Dr Beatriz Rodriguez, co-author of the study.
She is a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii in Manoa district.
The results were based on data on more than 6,000 men on the island of Oahu who participated in the Kukini Honolulu cardiology programme.
According to scientists, the results of the study may not apply to women and other populations as it concerned only men of Japanese origin.
Pesticides have a long half-life, so their health effects may be known many years after contact with these substances.
In this case, the most visible results were observed within 10 years of contact with plant protection products.
In a press release, Rodriguez reported: “After 34 years of male observations, the relationship between pesticide exposure and heart disease and stroke was no longer significant.
This was probably because the factors associated with aging were more important, which masked possible causal relationships between exposure to pesticides and susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases in later years of life.
Researchers have not found a significant relationship between exposure to small to moderate amounts of plant protection products and an increase in the risk of heart disease or stroke.
Phone call Zelenski-Trump: Poroshenko delivers his three dimes
Washington's politics has been in the middle of a turbulent week in connection with the initiation of an impeachment procedure against American President Donald Trump.
Being involved in a political scandal is for political debutist Volodymyr Zelenski the situation he would prefer to avoid.
But what do we really know about the Zelenski-Trump affair, and will it have far-reaching consequences for the first of them?
At the beginning of his phone call, Trump told Zelenski that the United States was doing more for Ukraine than European countries.
Despite the fact that the notes disclosed by the White House are not complete, they detail Trump's attack on German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the fact that German leaders and other leaders of European countries are engaged in negotiations instead of making concrete proposals.
The controversy sparked the Green response, which said that he agreed with Trump not 100%, but 1000%.
Zelenski added that both French President Macron and Merkel are not enough to help Ukraine.
This exchange of sentences made politicians, in particular Ukrainian opposition, decide to take a vote through social services.
Petro Porosenko, former President of Ukraine, said on Twitter that the EU's support "was unprecedented".
In other tweets, Poroshenko said he was grateful for the EU's support for the "Russian aggression" that included sanctions and financial assistance.
Others expressed their fears, including Ukrainian politicians Victoria Voytsitska said: “How can we talk to Germany and France now? ”
Trump then referred to military assistance and asked Zelenski to investigate not one, but two cases: the first concerning the son of Joe Biden-Hunter – and the second related to breaking into the DNC server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in a hacker attack on Democratic e-mail boxes during the 2016 elections.
It is not known whether this will describe European relations, or whether relations with the leader of France and Germany will be broken up.
I don't want to speak ill of anyone...
We thank all those who assist us" – he announced after the publication of the phone call record in New York during the UN General Assembly.
Zelenski is scheduled to meet with the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the coming summit of the "Four norm", which is scheduled to take place in October.
Former Provincial Inspector of the Province of Justice
The court cleared Jerzy Wiśniewski of his actions.
Six years later Jerzy Wiśniewski was finally cleared of charges.
The District Court of Industry cleared Jerzy Wiśniewski, former chief of the Regional Trade Quality Inspectorate of Agricultural and Food Products in Rzeszów, for overpayment.
The prosecutor’s office in Lublin told him that he was going to betray the marshal of that time of the province of the control period in the food oil-producing establishment.
There was a recent case involving a final judgment of acquittal.
The appeal was recognized on September 12.
“The Court of Justice has upheld the judgment of annulment under appeal”, confirms Judge Małgorzata Reiser, spokesman for the District Court of Industry.
It is a judgment of 14 February, issued by the District Court of Industry.
Jerzy Wiśniewski then commented on him on Facebook: “It was six years since I was presented by the Appellate Prosecutor in Lublin with a alleged violation of the law in a telephone conversation with Marshal of Podkarpacki Voivodeship on 30 April 2012.
The court clearly held that I was innocent and that I did not break the law in force at the time.
I was convinced that my phone call at the time with the Marshal of Podkarpacki voivodship was in accordance with the applicable law.
The version of the events that the media made public in 2013 by the Appellate Prosecutor's Office in Lublin was true and caused irreparable damage both to the food producer's entrepreneur and the loss of the image of my person to my employers, to my employees and to the local community.
The act of indictment that was drawn up against me in the Court's opinion contained a number of errors, false facts, incorrect legal definitions, which were not confirmed in reality by events.
With the help of CBA in Rzeszów, everything was done to eliminate me from public and professional life.
I was immediately released from work and deprived of funds.
I've been staying for a long time to keep my wife."
Let's remind ourselves.
Jerzy Wiśniewski served as the Provincial Inspector of Commercial Quality of Agricultural and Food Products in 2009-2013.
He was dismissed from office after the prosecutor's office in Lublin filed charges with him in 2013.
According to the investigators, he was to betray the voivodship marshal (Mirosław Karaczyta was sentenced to 4 years of imprisonment) the date of control in the food oil-producing plant belonging to the then vice-marszałka Podkarpacki.
This warning – according to prosecutors from Lublin – was to cause the owner of the company to know about control and correct labels on oils that were incomplete.
Jerzy Wiśniewski heard allegations of overcapacity, for which he had been threatened by deprivation of liberty for up to three years.
"I am relieved that this case has finally come to an end and the court has confirmed my innocence.
From the beginning, I was convinced that I had done nothing wrong, which is now finally confirmed by a valid judgment to absolve me of my charges," commented Jerzy Wiśniewski.
White House tried to hide the phone records from Zelenski
In a report published on Thursday, the teller said that President Donald Trump, speaking to the President of Ukraine, Wolodymyr Zelenski, was seeking interference from a foreign country in the US elections, and the White House was trying to hide the record of this conversation.
Presidents of Ukraine and the USA
In an anonymous interviewer report dated August 12, he wrote: “As part of my duties, I was informed by many members of the U.S. government that the president used his function to demand foreign interference in the U.S. elections in 2020.
‘Trump used part of the conversation (from Zelenski) to pursue his own interests.
Exactly – he tried to push the Ukrainian leader to take steps that would help the president in the 2020 review", says a report quoted by The Hill Journal.
The Ukrainian leader was “given to understand” that his contacts with Trump depended on “showing the will to take the game” in matters about which he was to inform the lawyer of President Rudy Giuliani more accurately.
The author admits that he did not witness the conversation, but stresses that he has been informed in detail of its contents by “many officials of the White House who had direct information on the subject” and their relationship was covered.
"In the following days, after this conversation, I learned from many U.S. officials that high ranking representatives of the White House intervened in order to “ seal” all the archival records concerning this conversation, and in particular the literal record that was written, as is usually done in the White House crisis room," we read.
"The White House officials said to me that the White House lawyers "commanded them to remove electronic records from the information system in which such records were kept.
The record has been moved to a separate electronic system, which is usually used to store and manipulate sensitive information," wrote the author of the report.
"In my assessment these steps show that officials of the White House were aware of the importance of what happened during the conversation," the teller said.
According to the AP, this document will likely speed up the proceedings on the possible impeachment of the president, and it also contains valuable information about witnesses who can confirm this relationship.
The record of the conversation with the Zelenska White House, following the pressure of Congress, made available on Wednesday, but not on the basis of an electronic record, but on the basis of the accounts of the people who witnessed it.
The content of the report, in the edited version, revealed the day after the interview committee of the House of Representatives.
On Thursday, Joseph Maguire, director of the American Intelligence Committee, testified before the House of Representatives interview committee and provided explanations on the manner in which he received the interview worker’s report.
Maguire said the signaler made the right choice and did what the law ordered.
He also stressed that in his opinion, the matter of talking to the Green is an event “without precedent”.
The Democrats in the interview committee asked Maguire why he blocked the release to Congress of the signaller's report; the interview director replied that he had no authority to disclose its content, which is guaranteed by the so-called privilege of the executive.
A part of Maguire's hearing by the committee was held behind closed doors.
On Tuesday, the president of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, informed that due to the suspicion that the President had exerted pressure on the Ukrainian authorities to harm his potential rival in the next presidential election, the Chamber of Representatives was initiating an investigation that could lead to Trump's impeachment.
A day later, she assessed that the record of Trump's conversation with Zelenski confirmed that the president of the United States had broken the electoral and security standards.
The U.S. electoral law prohibits the use of foreign aid.
On Thursday, White House spokesperson Stephanie Grisham said that there was no "nothing wrong" in the conversation, and in the report "there is nothing more than a set of third-hand relationships and glued together press clippings".
"The White House will continue to criticise this hysteria of media and false narrative promoted by the mainstream media," she added.
Ghana wins two ICAO prizes
Ghana won two prestigious prizes during the 40th meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in Montreal, Canada.
The security award was awarded in evidence that Ghana obtained the highest number of aviation safety oversight points in Africa, i.e. 89.89 per cent of the temporary rate of effective implementation (EI).
This happened when ICAO completed its control of ICVM on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the United Nations Aviation Agency’s General Aviation Safety Audit Programme.
The security award was proof of the country's high commitment to implementing ICAO standards and security protocols at Ghana's airports and airspace.
The award programme has been developed to support ICAO's No Country Left Behind initiative.
In addition, 16 other safety and security certificates and 17 in the field of security have been granted to ICAO Member States that have improved their safety and security standards.
During the award of the awards to Ghana, the Minister of Aviation, Joseph Kifi Adda, Director General of the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority, Simon Allotey, Ambassador Ghana in Canada, Nii Ayikoi Otoo and Managing Director Ghana Airport Company Limited, Yaw Kwakwa were present.
In his speech, the President of the International Civil Aviation Organization, Olumuyiva Benard Aliu, stressed the need for safety in airspace by the Member States.
He said "it is important for us to keep in mind that even in the age of innovation, aviation security and sustainable development must remain our primary priorities."
For his part, Mr. Adda noted that the prizes were a huge achievement for the state's efforts because they are a compliment to the hard work and sustainability of the industry.
He added that the aviation industry has a huge potential for developing the country’s economy, saying: “Afforestation has powerful opportunities to change our lives.
These are socio-economic benefits, but all stems from the security and protection that we have managed to achieve."
SUPPORT: He was refueling and running, and he stole his bike too.
A 50-year-old from the municipality of Zamność was coming up his audie under the distributor, charging and leaving without paying.
That's how he robbed gas stations a few times.
A man a month ago also stole a bike from one of the overseas offices.
Gas station owners priced losses on almost 1 000 PLN.
Owner of stolen bicycle – for PLN 2 000.
On the past Tuesday, one of the Zamora district was spotted on the street of the Wyszyński Audi, whose owner was suspected of stealing.
He was behind the wheel looking for 50-year-olds.
The man was detained in police custody.
On Thursday, he heard charges of oil theft from four petrol stations and a bicycle.
He confessed to committing these crimes.
The Mundurs also found a stolen bicycle.
He'll be back soon to the owner.
Thieves are under threat of imprisonment until the age of 5.
Trump nominates Peter Gaynor to head of FEMA: White House
Peter Gaynor, who serves as the administrator of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA), smiles at the Senate Budget Subcommittee meeting on the FEMA budget proposal for the financial year 2020 at Washington, D.C., on 3 April 2019.
WASHYNGTON (Reuters) – The White House announced that on Thursday, US President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor as head of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA).
Gaynor, deputy administrator of FEMA, is the head of the agency that oversees the government's response to disasters such as hurricanes or forest fires.
The Agency has been operating without an administrator approved by the US Senate since March, when Brock Long fired this position.
Long resigned after the U.S. National Security Department, which is subject to FEMA, stated that Long had misused government vehicles to travel between Washington and his home in North Carolina.
Another candidate for this position, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn earlier this month, when a thorough examination of his past revealed allegations that he was involved in a bar fight.
Gaynor's nomination was expected.
To approve his nomination for this role, a majority of the Senate will be required.
The White House informed that before Gaynor became Deputy Administrator of FEMA in 2018, he worked in crisis management in Rhode Island and served in marine infantry.
Henrik Ingebrigtsen, Norwegian runner, considering amputation finger
The 28-year-old runner specialized at 1,500 metres, winning the 2012 European Championship Gold Medal (Helsinki), silver in 2014 (Zurich) and brown in 2016 (Amsterdam).
He is also European Deputy Minister for 5000 metres from 2018 (Berlin).
He explained that it was not a new problem and that he had already undergone one operation right after the 2016 games, but the pain had returned and the current season became very intense.
Pain causes me to put my foot on the other side, which changes my body's structure, there are other unnatural loads, and I'm beginning to feel pain elsewhere, for example in the hip.
For this reason, I could not prepare myself enough for the world championships, and for two weeks the pain is so severe that I have difficulty putting the stakes on my hips – said the runner on the television channel of the NRK.
Gjert Ingebrigtsen's father and coach admitted that after long discussions with his son, they had concluded that the only solution not to end his career and participate in the next year's Tokyo Olympics would be amputation.
It seems that this is the only, although the drastic solution and the decision have already actually come true.
"If part of the body hurts, it should be removed, and in total Henrik does not need this finger so much, and in this situation it should be forgotten about cosmetics," he explained.
Police close the illegal e-paper factory with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley – CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) – On Thursday, the police closed an illegal e-paper factory with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley.
An office building on 9600 Telstar Avenue was raided around 16:37 p.m., during which police searched for illegal e-papers containing marijuana and during which large jars containing butane hashish oil – a concentrate from Indian cannabis were found.
According to Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police, officers also found a device that was used to supplement the vaping contributions.
"This process is very dangerous," Cano says.
Cano, who used to work on drugs, says that the distillation of oil used in vaping products is a potentially flammable process.
"The usual electrostatic spark from our clothes can cause the fire of these vapours, causing not only fire, but due to concentration, even explosion," he says.
"If we have many elephants and similar ones in the room, after one explosion there will be another, causing not only a fire but also an explosion that could remove the entire complex from the surface.
The office was called upon by a team to carry out special tasks in order to deal with illegal and potentially dangerous substances.
At present, the value of the products and equipment confiscated is not known.
Detectives say they received an anonymous tip that allowed them to get a search warrant, thereby detecting illegal activity.
Investigators are still trying to get information about who's behind this illegal business.
According to them, the responsible person set up a business here because the office was empty.
The investigation is ongoing and the officers want to make sure that illegal products have not reached the street, taking into account recent articles on the harmfulness of vaccination.
"People don't really know what products they buy," Cano says.
‘They may be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
This may pose a threat to our community and children, which is why we always keep them from reaching for such things.
Aphtin withdrawn from circulation.
GIF decided to take the medicine for molders.
The Chief Pharmaceutical Inspector has informed about withdrawal of the medicinal product from the market for oral infections.
Aphtin is a medicine that is used to treat moulds and yeast infections in the mouth, infections with Gram-positive bacteria.
It can also be used as an aid in the treatment of infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The product was withdrawn due to non-conformity with the requirements of the product quality specification and a decrease in the active substance content.
The product was withdrawn at the request of the Galen Laboratory in Olsztyn.
On average, on a monthly basis, GIF issues several decisions on the withdrawal of a series of products.
You can re-enter the market after presenting evidence of safety.
If the medicine is withdrawn, there is no possibility.
Banknote 19 zł – where to buy a collector's note about this denomination?
It features the 19th gold denomination and the image of Ignating Jan Paderewski appears on it.
In early October, a new collector’s banknote will be put into circulation, informing the National Bank of Poland.
It's another "Independence" note.
He is to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the formation of the Polish Securities Production Company.
As stated in the NBP Communication, Ignacy Jan Paderewski will be presented on the banknote.
The date on the note, January 25, 2019, is the day on which the 100th anniversary of the creation of the PWPW.
Also the nominal value, 19 zł, refers to the year of creation of the Production" - we read in the NBP Communication.
The water mark shows the image of the eagle from the first Polish banknote produced in the PWPW after regaining independence.
The novelty is a holographic belt placed on a window in the ground.
The front page presents the portrait of Ignating Jan Paderewski, and next to the inscription “insubstantial” a stylized image of the order of the White Eagle was presented.
This inscription, drawn from the manuscript by Józef Pilsudski, is a logo of the 100th anniversary of Poland's regaining independence.
The branch of cotton, symbolizing fraternity and victory, consists of the security developed by the PWPW - Umbra4Note, which is a special form of angular effect.
On the reverse banknote page there is a picture of the macho Production on the background of the modern Warsaw panorama.
Next to it is built in the PWPW logo of SPARK Live security and the opalizing belt, also visible in UV light in the form of repeated numbers "19" and the abbreviation "NBP" - describes NBP.
The banknote is scheduled for circulation on October 2nd up to 55,000 pieces.
One bill will cost 80 zlotys.
All coins and banknotes issued by NBP, including special series, are legal tender in Poland.
However, their nominal value is much higher than that which can be achieved on the collector market.
The new owner bought it for $500,000, over two million, for his parents, and decided to move the building to Queenstown in Maryland.
The house was transported on a special platform to Easton Port where it was loaded onto a boat.
That's 50 miles across the river.
Jarosław Kaczyński will vote in favour of Málgorzata Gosiewska
The President of the PSI Jarosław Kaczyński in the upcoming elections will give his vote to Málgorzata Gosyewski.
"I ask the same thing," he appealed.
Jarosław Kaczyński and Małgorzata Gosivska pose for the photo of the banner candidate PIS.
On Friday, the "troika" in Warsaw boasted in social media that it obtained the voice of Kaczynski in parliamentary elections.
"The President of the Law and Justice Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński supports the Gosevska Małgorzata", we read on her Facebook profile.
The party chief pointed out that he was a sensitive, emotional person and was always ready to bring help.
"I'm going to give my voice to Gossivska Małgorzata and I'm asking for the same thing," he appeals.
Gosivska is running for Sejm from District 19 (Warsaw) and third place on the list.
"One" is Kaczyński, and the second is Mariusz Kaminski.
Here comes the Christmas Book Fair.
In front of us meetings with popular writers and books at special prices.
"We are here to break stereotypes.
The people of Podkarpatia are told that they don't read books.
We will show that it is different," Marta Poltorak said during the press conference.
And who will support reading in the Reich this year?
As we have heard, Sister Anastasia will appear at the fair, who is called the first cook of the Republic of Poland, as well as Lukasz Orbitowski, Katarzyna Bonda, Karolina Korwin-Piotrowska and Jakub Ćwiek.
This autumn in Millenium Hall will take place a great cultural event – November 22 and 23 – to the shopping center the 3rd edition of the Book Fair, one of the most important reading events in the region.
The most interesting publishing and bookkeeping officers from all over Poland will come to the fair.
There will be 30 of them, including Agora, Signs, SQNs, PWNs and Blacks.
At their posts, they will present their wide publishing offers and hundreds of novelties that will be able to buy participants at attractive prices.
Moreover, during the two days of the fair there will be special meetings with the writers.
This time authors were invited to write about important issues and not afraid to take up difficult topics, and they are also winners of prestigious awards and... they cook great.
The list of invited authors is not closed yet.
At the moment, participation in the fair was confirmed, among others, by Lukasz Orbitowski – the winner of the political passport, Janusz Leon Wiśniewski, the best seller of "Loneliness in the Network", and by the Queen of Polish Crimes herself: Katarzyna Bonda.
The star of this year's fair will be Sister Anastasia, author of several books (including cooks) sold in over 4 million copies.
Exhibition of missing Elizabeth's dress in the Hampton Court Palace
The silver threaded dress made of the most distinctive silk camel was beautifully decorated with embroidered embroidery of vegetation, animals and butterflies.
For Elerie Lynn, curator of the Royal Palaces Foundation exhibition, this meant only one thing.
The glossy fabric hanging for 100 years on the wall of the tiny rural parish church she was looking at could only be a missing part of Elizabeth I's wardrobe.
Three years after Lynn stumbled upon an exhibited altar cloth in Bacton County, Herefordshire, the missing Elizabeth dress is due to hit next month at an exhibition in the Hampton Court Palace, close to the same rooms in which the Tudor Queen could wear it over 450 years ago.
The significance of this discovery is that from the entire collection the royal dress survived only one more element of the 16th-century dress.
Although there is no compelling evidence of Elizabeth ever wearing this dress, three years of research has strengthened experts in the belief that it must have been part of the royal wardrobe.
"The silverheads", incredibly expensive fabric, was legally reserved only for the most important members of the royal court, and the virtual quality of the embroidered plants and flowers, then enriched with deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears, indicates that the dress belonged to the most distinctive of the people.
The dress, when it was sewn up, could cost the equivalent of the Tudor estate.
“In addition, in the 1990s, at the end of Elizabeth’s reign, she felt threatened by other women on the court and would not tolerate rivals wearing such elaborate fabrics” says Lynn.
"As a very important statement, I asked many people from the environment to watch the dress.
It really pleased me that when they saw the dress, they also admired it and were practically convinced that we had an element of the royal wardrobe in front of us.
Long, life again dress, cut to serve as an altar cloth at the dark St Faith church in Bacton, is not as unexpected as it might seem.
Bacton is the settlement where Blanche Parry came from, the closest lady to Elizabeth the court, who has served the queen for her long life and with which in local legends the said cloth was identified.
Although the dress was created after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth had to give it to the Parry family or parish to the memory of Blanche before her death in 1603.
After more than a thousand hours of maintenance work, four hundred of which took place on the finest hand stitch using specially colored silk and thin surgical needles, the altar cloth will be presented next to an exhibition rented by the Hathfield House Palace of the portrait of Rainbow Portrait, one of the most famous paintings of the time presenting Elizabeth wearing a similar dress.
"In the course of working with the historical fabric, the work of the people who made it is truly respected," says Libby Thompson, head of conservation works, most of which were carried out in the glasshouse on the Hampton Court Palace, the only large enough place to house some of the priceless palace gobelts.
"Seeing the embroidery from the front and back, I began to feel great respect for those who made it.
I've never worked on anything so elite.
The exhibition "The Lost Dress of Elizabeth" begins on October 12 at Hampton Court
Fitch confirmed Poland's rating with a stable perspective
Fitch confirmed on Friday a long-term rating of Poland in a foreign currency at the level of ‘A-’ – indicated in the Communication.
The rating outlook remained stable.
"Fitch's agency points to strong macroeconomic foundations and a well-diversified economy, which is supported by a prudent economic policy and a strong banking sector," we read in a Communication from the Ministry of Finance.
Fitch added that Poland was at the top of the cyclical cycle, and in 2019-2021 the real growth rate of Gross National Product in Poland would be 4.1 per cent, 3.3 per cent and 2.9 per cent respectively.
The Agency predicts that the government deficit to GDP for 2020-2021 will remain below 3 per cent, 2.3 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively.
"The government debt ratio to GDP in 2019 will be 50.5 per cent by agency and will be smaller in the following years (average 48.3 per cent over 2020-2021)", we read.
Rating from Poland
The autumn round of reviews of the ratings of Poland on October 11 will end S&P and Moody's.
The rating of Poland in the assessment of Fitch remains the same as that issued at the end of March 2019.
At that time, the agency confirmed the rating of Poland at the ‘A-’ level with a stable perspective.
Of the three largest credit rating agencies, Poland's creditworthiness is highest rated by Moody's – at the level of “A2”.
Polish rating according to Fitch and S&P is a "A-", one level below Moody's.
The perspectives of all evaluations are stable.
What's a credit rating?
Credit rating agencies shall be set up to assist investors in assessing the risk of their investment activities.
Credit rating is granted to companies, banks and states.
For these latter, each assessment shall be translated into economic attractiveness.
Rating is nothing more than an assessment of creditworthiness.
Based on it, decisions are made about who and how much to borrow money.
Sometimes such information also suggests who best not to give any credit at all, because there is a great risk that money will not recover.
The lower rating is associated with higher risk.
On the other hand, higher risk is high interest on the loan.
Each assessment must be justified and authorised.
The rating can be manipulated, but in this case agencies risk losing reputation.
At the moment, over 90 percent of the world credit market is controlled by three agencies: Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.
Each of these uses its own system of assessments.
‘Fifet of Confederation’: First, 1000 plus
The Fifth Confederation, which is the main foundation of the electoral programme, was presented on Friday in Kostunica by candidates for the Sejm from district 40 applying for a mandate from the list of KW Confederation Freedom and Independence.
The leader of the Warsaw Letter to Sejm Krzysztof Chmielewski presented the slogan "Friend of Confederate".
"First program 1000 plus for Poland, second swift and fair courts, third cultural and educational vouchers, after fourth national security, fifth it is a healthy life," Chmielewski said.
He pointed out that "Police must finally start to earn well", which is why the Confederate wants to liquidate income tax and, as Chmielewski said, "the problem with tax-free amount will resolve itself".
"The Poles must be given a choice where they want to save their money for retirement, i.e. zero PIT and voluntary ZUS for all," said the leader of the list on the founding of the "1000 Plus Programme for Poland".
In contrast, Alexander Zadenck, who started from the second place of the list, said that "health is getting worse" and that in order to change this, it is necessary to "strengthen Polish farmers, Polish agriculture", to work for GMO-free crops.
As she said, the Confederate also advocates the cessation of “stygmatism of hemp hemp”.
Zadencka declared support to the Confederation for “the development of construction using natural materials”.
She also spoke on behalf of her group for “voluntary vaccinations”.
"The right to informed consent cannot be violated," she added.
Other candidates for Sejm from the Warsaw district stressed that the Confederation is in favour of a "major reform of the judiciary", which would include examining the case by the judge "day after day".
They also argued that the educational subsidy should be made available to schools without the intermediation of the local government, which they considered to be free of additional costs related to the maintenance of officials.
The Confederate is also behind the "strong Polish army based on the Polish industry and Polish soldiers".
The candidates for the Sejm stressed the need to increase the army's numbers.
According to them, easier access to weapons is also needed.
On economic issues, they stressed the need for "constant access to energy".
"We can gas the coal, we have a lot of geothermal energy, we also need to consider going back to the idea of the nuclear power plant," said the fifth on the electoral list of Piotr Karpinski.
The head of the Mexican cartel is behind one-third of drugs in the United States.
Chicago – just east of the West Side in Chicago CBS News reported an early drive for drugs.
Brian McKnight of the DEA showed what was going on.
Last year, nearly 800 people died of drug overdose in Chicago.
McKnight said "probably 90%" of the drugs in Chicago came from Mexico.
The DEA is focused on the Mexican drug lord Nemesio Cervantes, simply known as El Mencho.
"It is the most important priority for the DEA and directly to the federal executive authorities in the United States," said Matthew Donahue, the main agent of the DEA in Mexico.
The El Mencho Award is $10 million.
He helped discover dozens of people in the El Mencho drug lab jungle.
The El Mencho Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generation, or CJNG, is responsible for at least one third of drugs that reach the US by land and sea.
According to the Justice Department, the cartel smuggled “tons” of cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin contaminated by fentanyl.
The reward for El Mencho's head is $10 million.
Ironically, about 30 years ago, he lived in California, where he was arrested for drug charges and eventually deported to Mexico.
That's where he created a brutal cartel.
He's got a huge amount of weapons, RPGs, 50-caliber weapons.
He basically owns his own SWAT team," said Donahue.
El Mencho is free to protect his empire by using such measures as shooting down a Mexican army helicopter, killing six people, or participating in public hanging this summer.
In recent years, cartel brutality has led to thousands of murders.
According to statistics from the Mexican government, about 94 murders occur every day.
Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic they can't be handled without protective equipment.
In the lab, a pack of cocaine means a brand of a smuggler.
For more than a third of them, the trail leads to the El Mencho cartel.
"He is responsible for sending poison that kills innocent women and children," said Donahue.
So when someone's child dies, Donahue says there's a "big chance" that drugs come from El Mencho's organization.
Last year more than 67,000 Americans died of overdose.
France: 27-year-old blackmailed the President of France and his wife
A 27-year-old man tried to blackmail Emmanuel Macron and the first lady – claims the French prosecutor's office.
The accused shall ensure that he has documents compromising the presidential couple.
He demanded 300 000 euros in cash from the Head of State, among others.
A man who was born in Azerbaijan and wanted to work in France in police stations claims to have received "explosive" documents from a person employed in the Palace of Elisha.
During the hearings, he explained that these documents not only compromise the presidential couple, but their full disclosure could threaten the safety of Macron and the first lady of France.
In exchange for their return, he demanded 300,000 euros – he also wanted to get a flat in Paris.
He contacted one of the daughters of Brigitte Macron from his previous marriage.
According to the prosecutor's office, the defendant refused to hand over the documents he was talking about to the police.
He announced that he would transmit them to the media – but it is not yet clear whether these documents really exist.
They weren't found during the audit in that 27-year-old's apartment.
The man was undergoing psychiatric examinations, but his doctors did not find any serious problems.
PS4 will be an old-fashioned game – Sony reveals surprising facts about PlayStation 4
Sony sheds more light on the soon-to-be playable only on PS4 The Last of Us: Part Two.
In a recent State of Play presentation, Sony announced that the premiere of the "The Last of Us" will take place in February 2020.
Fans could also see a new piece of breath-taking game in the chest from the coming action game.
More details were revealed in the days after the loud premiere of The Last of Us 2.
And it looks like Sony and Naughty Dog are reaching out for old school climates in many ways.
The Last of Us: Part 2 will be sold on several tiles.
Neil Druckmann of Naughty Dog confirmed this in a great interview given by The Telegraph, explaining that the sequel has grown to one of the most extensive games in history.
"The label is ambitious and wrapped in aspects in which it was not the only one," he said.
She must have been so obsessive to present this kind of story with so many characters.
We weren't going to create the most extensive game, it just happened.
"We are excited about how many possibilities there are in this history. They will be when you think you're going to end up, but you will realize that this is just the beginning and that the whole new chapter is beginning," Druckmann says.
It's such an ambitious game that it didn't fit on one BluRay and it's on two tiles.
In another place it was revealed that The Last of Us: Part Two contains one or two easter angs about adult content (information given by Gamespot).
We will not spoil the surprise, but the appearances in the game of easter exams appeal to the old school works of Naughty Dog.
You will find out more when The Last of Us: Part Two debuts on 21 February 2020 only on PS4.
People with PS4 can prepare for the sequel premiere, reaching for The Last of Us Remastered available in PS Plus.
Sony recently announced a list of free PS4 games offered since October 2019 by PlayStation Plus, among which is the above-mentioned Naughty Dog production.
PS Plus subscribers will also have access to The Show 19 MLB since October.
If you like The Last of Us Remastered and want to make a pre-premier order for the sequel, Sony said there would be many versions of the game, including an exclusive edition containing the replica of Ellie's backpack and her bracelet and a 30-centimeter figure of this cult character.
Run, fight and fight - Sport
On Saturday, the prissoligo Stomil will take Podbeskid and be willing to win.
Stomila's soccer players since the three lines are unbeatable.
Piotr Záczykowski's backing at the time gained seven points because they won with Stala Mielec and Chojnikzanka Chojnice, and in the last match, a seamless draw in Suvalk.
Now the Olsztyn team will take Podbeskid on Saturday at 18 o'clock, which is exchanged as one of the favourites for promotion to Extraklasa.
The nearest Stomila rivals occupy fourth place in the table and have a point of precedence over the Olsztyn team.
The podbeskid on trips this season played six times and scored two victories, remissions and defeats of Natomiast Stomil very well on his property – at the stadium near the al. Pilsudski 69a team Piotr Zajczowski won three times and lost once.
In total, 17 points were collected by the altars in ten lines and are at the top of the table, although after two failures at the start of the game, nothing announced.
"Every change takes time for results," explains Peter Skiba.
“ After all, something went wrong with us, we believed in ourselves, and we could work under normal conditions.
We just focused on the ball game.
They're clean heads, there's a good atmosphere, and everybody knows what to do, because we have a strong training staff."
On Tuesday, Stomila's footballers eliminated the Polish Chorzów Cup, but they needed a playoffs and a series of criminal shoots.
In the south of Poland, Piotr Skiba, Grzegorz Lech and Janusz Buchollc did not go because Coach Zajzkowski gave rest to these key players before Saturday's encounter with Podbeskid.
In Chorzow, however, he played the returning after the injury of Jakub Mosakowski, who finally shot his long - awaited goal.
“It’s always fun to get naked, and I’m still at such a time that we can continue to play in the cupboards (Mosakowski leveled to 3:3 in 119 mint-order.).
My dad used to bite me and laugh that I couldn't get the gate, and I always told him I'd shoot at a time he didn't expect."
Now Mosakowski is counting on the return to the basic composition, especially because of the yellow cards he can't play Oleh Tarasenko.
"That's why I'm taking the training hard to play in the first composition," Mosakowski says.
"In the sick, I did everything I could to present myself as best I could.
But whether I'm gonna play or sit on the reserve bench, I'm gonna be supporting the team as much as I am.
Because the most important thing is the team and three points in the game with Podbeskid.
I'm sure we'll have a tough meeting where the victory will have to run out, go to waste and fight."
In the middle of the Olsztyn defense can still play Rafał Remish, who has recently also suffered an injury, so whether or not it happens, we will only find out on Saturday, especially since coach Zajczykowski traditionally tries to keep secrets until the end of the personnel matter.
A man raped and murdered a niece.
"You will never see the light of day.
You will never breathe fresh air again," said Judge Kevin K. Allen, turning to Alex Whipple.
"What you did was so disgusting and vile that you have to spend the rest of your life in prison," he added.
Five-year-old Lizzie disappeared in May.
Her search lasted five days, until Whipple identified the place of concealment of the body.
"How could anyone do this to his own niece?" Deay Smith, an uncle of a girl.
"You are the worst person humanity has to offer," said Alex Whipple.
"I would give anything to meet her again, hug her," the mother of the murdered girl said.
"Our life will never be the same again," a broken woman added.
According to Fox News, 22-year-old Whipple showed no emotion during the hearing.
Last month, he admitted he was kidnapped, sexually abused, and murdered a girl.
A man's lawyer said that his client was raised in a "perfect family".
He was to be molested as a child.
He also added that Whipple is aware that he has committed a terrible act and is ready to suffer a punishment.
The man was sentenced to life without the possibility of seeking parole.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that he would hand almost $100 million in extra resources to communities affected by drought.
The programme providing money to farmers affected by drought will be extended and the criteria for assigning allowances to farms will be simplified.
The aid package covers almost $34 million to support communities affected by drought, allowing eligible farmers to receive up to $3,000 in emergency cases.
Each of the 13 local self-government areas under the drought community assistance programme will receive up to $1 million in infrastructure grants and disaster relief assistance.
The new support package is an addition to more than $7 billion of government funding for the drought fund.
Frostpunk - a strategic game combining the characteristics of the production of the city-builder with the unique simulator of the 19th-century society and the cold savage – is approaching the planned premiere on the consoles on 11 October.
11 bit studios have made every effort to create a strategic game in which, intuitively and naturally, they can play with a console controller.
Frostpunk: Console Edition on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 was therefore built on some of the basics.
Among the leading changes are the remodeled control system and the refreshed user interface, among others, with new electoral circles, quick access actions and comfortable grouping available in the game of buildings.
For all console players who do not know Frostpunk, we have the introduction into the cold universe of the game in the form of a fairy tale:
Frostpunk is a game about survival over the edge of a society in which heat means life and each decision has a price.
The player's job is to build on the frozen desert of a city whose heart is a steam generator.
Now a comprehensive, strategic game, combined with a rich story and an unmatched survival experience, will be available on consoles.
Frostpunk: Console Edition will be a real test for your tactical knowledge.
Chinese Betrayals (In the Name of Love China's Mistress Busters)
documentary film: In China, divorce rates have doubled in the last decade.
This condition was usually caused by third parties.
More and more men maintain extra-marriage relationships, which has led to the education of a special industry in the country – a professional slayer of lovers who are tasked with saving the marriage of betrayed wives.
Let's scan out loud, ma-te-shut!
An attempt to welcome the Prime Minister to the Silesian Bakers
A personal general test was carried out before the election with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in the Silesian Piekarów.
“We will not welcome the Prime Minister here, ladies and gentlemen, more louder, louder!
Let's scan loudly, ma-te-shut!", urged the speaker.
Unfortunately, the efforts of the enthusiastic plumber did not produce the expected result.
The election campaign is under way.
Politicians drive all over the country, persuading voters.
An intensive campaign is also conducted by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who, as the leader of the Silesian PiS list, is a frequent guest in the region.
Each meeting is carefully scheduled, including an appropriate arrangement.
It was also, or rather – it was supposed to be, in the Śląskie bakeries.
It is known – a special guest should be especially welcome.
Before meeting with the Prime Minister, the moderator decided to conduct a general test.
Like a hardy warlord trying to encourage a mob to chant the name of the head of government.
"This will not be a greeting for me, but for Prime Minister Matthew Moravian!
Also louder, louder my darlings!", encouraged the disentangled.
Unfortunately, the crowd was unable to fully grasp the hot name of the leader and reluctantly responded to the ‘Ma-te-usch’, but the video of enthusiastic water makes a furor on the network.
Ronald Lee Haskell: A man convicted of murdering his ex-wife's family in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was sentenced to murder Stephen and Katie Stay in 2014 and four of their five children in Spring, Texas.
According to the authorities, he entered the house of Stay on 9 July 2014, demanding the disclosure of his wife, Melanie Haskell, with whom he was separated.
She wasn't there, but she was her sister, Katie Stay, and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys 13 and 4 years old, and two girls aged 9 and 7, died when Haskell opened fire, according to the Sheriff's Office of the County Harris.
Only one family member survived, 15-year-old Cassidy Stay.
The authorities said she was seriously injured, but she was able to recover completely.
On Thursday, jury members rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's defense on the grounds of insanity.
The jury will gather again on Monday to issue judgment.
Quantum Internet closer and closer to reality – ScienceDaly
The U.S. Army research results are moving the quantum Internet one step closer.
Such an internet could offer military capabilities in the areas of security, detection and accuracy of time immeasurable in the traditional approach to networking.
The Center for Dispersed Quantum Processing of Military Information at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory was looking at researchers at the University of Insbruck, who managed to achieve a record transfer of the state of confusion between matter and light, 50 kilometres away using the fibre cables.
Confusion is a correlation that can arise between quantums such as cubits.
When two cubits are mixed together and one of them is measured, this will have an impact on the measurement made on the other, even if the other cubits are physically distant.
"These [50 kilometers] are two rows of size beyond that previously possible and this is the feasible distance to start the construction of inter-city quantum networks," said Dr. Ben Lanyon, an experimental physicist from Innsbruck University and the main researcher in the project, whose findings were published in the journal Nature, Quantum Information.
Intermediate quantum networks would consist of remote nodes of the physical cubits network, which are combined despite a large physical distance.
Researchers have found that this dispersal of the confused state is necessary for the creation of a quantum Internet.
"This demonstration is a major step forward in achieving a wide-scale disputed state of affairs," said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-chairing a military programme supporting these studies.
The quality of the state of confusion at the second end is also high enough to meet some of the most difficult uses of quantum networks.
The research team started an experiment with the calcium atom trapped in the ion trap.
With the help of laser bundles, researchers entered the quantum state in ion, simultaneously encouraging it to produce a photon in which quantum information was recorded.
As a result, the quantum states of the atom and the particles of light were confused.
The challenge is to send a photon with a fiber optic cable.
"The image emitted by the ion of calcium has a wave length of 854 nanometers and is rapidly absorbed by the luminaire," Lanyon said.
Hence, his team initially sent a piece of light through a nonlinear crystal illuminated by a powerful laser beam.
The length of the photon wave has been converted to an optimal value from a long distance transmission – the current standard telecommunications wavelength is 1,550 nanometers.
The researchers then sent this photon over a 50-kilometre fibre cable.
Their measurements show that the atoms and particles of light were still confused even after changing the wavelength and passing that distance.
‘The calcium selection decision means that this result sets the straight path for the creation of a combined network of atomic clocks at large physical distances, as calcium can be combined with a high quality bucket ‘satre’.
The army is very interested in combined clock networks built on a large scale due to applications for precise positioning, precise navigation and time synchronization," said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a military researcher who also manages the programme.
