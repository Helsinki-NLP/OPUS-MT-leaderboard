Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe
He's charismatic.
For his holy Mass for release and healing, the crowds draw down.
He was a couple of years old when things started to seem inexplicable in his life.
Today, by means of the Franciscan, others experience it.
On the eve of the Witko Mass for the release and healing of the crowds
Once upon a time, the parents of a 7-month-old child who had a 7,5 mm hole in his heart came to him.
It was supposed to be operated on.
Father Joseph Witko prayed about him.
On the same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for surgery.
Intrigued doctors said: “The operation is not needed, the loss is only 1.5 mm.”
My parents were crying out of happiness.
After another prayer, the Franciscanine hole disappeared completely.
The unique works of the Creator began to be experienced as a teenager.
In his dreams, clean souls came to him with a request for help.
I was awake at night and prayed for the dead and those who died in the moment – he recalls.
He also experienced the presence of a wicked spirit.
And he had a vision of what was happening to a man who committed a mortal sin.
"My body has begun to change.
I lost human qualities and began to take the look of an animal," he says.
The invisible force carried him up, couldn't get his voice out.
He felt lost.
Then God showed him salvation.
"Sealed in the waters of the river symbolizing the baptism of the holy, I was released and returned to the human form...", he says.
He hasn't told anyone about this strange experience.
His calling was ripe.
He was 16 when he joined the French.
In his sermons, he did more than talk about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the charismatic Renewal Community in the Holy Spirit
A number of people who count on getting rid of the disease are involved in the Masses to heal their father, Witko.
The spiritual one stresses, however, that their main objective is spiritual healing, not physical healing.
The first defeat of Kolpinga FRAC Jarosław
Today (September 26th) the afternoon team Kolpinga FRAC earned its current champion Dartom Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd LOTTO Superliga Tennis Table.
Jaroslating in the personal group that they presented with the citizens has no chance of winning with the sovereigns of the league.
This was clearly shown by a duel with Darto Bogoria.
The team is still missing, being called the leader of the team, Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps with him, in his composition, the lunar blessing would reach after the third triumph in the new season.
Young Asian Qiyao Han has probably not yet grown up to win with a number of such as the Greek Panagiotis Gionis or the Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, the Badowski brand.
The leader from Hellady was the biggest star of the competition in the MosiR Hall at Sikorski Street in Jarosław.
Both at the start of Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei were a class of themselves.
After three units Kolping FRAC led 2-1.
Kou Lei must have played Mark Badowski, and Daniel Górak after an exciting five-hundred fight – Pavel Siruck.
But then it was worse.
Gionis didn't give Lei a chance.
You could still hope to win for two points, but Qiyao Han did not forgive Badowski.
There won't be any more tests for seniors.
Why?
According to Rafał Trzaskowska, a free prophylaxis programme for 70 and 80 years of age was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be put into effect because it has not been accepted by the Ministry of Health and the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and Tariffs.
The agency explained that the target group was wrongly chosen.
“These actions may have an impact on the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to deepening the difficulties in accessing NFZ benefits and negatively affecting patients, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with falsely positive research results”, it was written.
The president of the capital doesn't understand the decision of the resort.
"The money is ours, we have foreseen it.
Only the government fears that if people examine themselves, they will then go to a doctor, which is absurd, because it is precisely to lead to a situation in which prophylaxis can be carried out more quickly.
All specialists know that this helps with the burden on the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in the proper approach to health.
The government here has a very strange position which I do not understand," said Rafael Trzaskowski.
"It's hard for me to imagine that experts say, "Let's not study, because there will be longer lines at the doctor's office, and if these specialists advise the government, I'm not surprised that this is the condition of the health service," Po added.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break up any agreements that have been made so far.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced on Thursday at the UN General Assembly that he would break all agreements with Israel if the future government tried to comply with Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement of the annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.
"If the future government of Israel stands up to implement this plan, we will invalidate all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made," he announced.
“We will reject the whole plan completely and completely”, he threatened with Abbas’ pressure.
"It is our duty to defend all of our rights by all possible means – it is of little importance to what will be the consequences – fully committed to the application of international law and to the fight against terrorism," declared the President of the Palestinian Authority, who has already made similar declarations in July.
Netanyahu, the former prime minister of Israel, was reinstated after the 17 September elections.
One week before the election, he announced that if he won, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intend to include all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank in Israel.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Jaser Arafat, signed a number of peace agreements with the United States.
The 84-year-old Abbas also promised at the session of the UN General Assembly the holding of universal elections on Palestinian soils.
The last was held in 2006.
"After returning to the country, I will call on the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem local elections, and all those who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," the Palestinian president declared solemnly.
Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer in the United Nations, to exercise the powers conferred on “full-fledged members of the United Nations and all its organs and institutions”.
The Palestinian leader concluded his speech by calling on the international community “to force Israel to comply fully with the United Nations provisions”.
Ambassador Danny Danon of Israel replied briefly to Abbas, stating that the Palestinian leader “will want to focus on the efforts of the Palestinian Authority against Israel, rather than to fight against the calls for terrorism in Autonomy under his leadership”.
However, according to the agencies, Danon did not refer to Netanyahu’s foretold annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.
Rescuers want defibrillators at non-algeic points Industry
The history of the border crossing shows that the automatic defibrillator AED can save human life.
Voivodeship Rescue Station in Industry wants such devices to be found at the city's norralgia points.
For their position, the officers received gratification diplomas from the Voivodship Station of the Rescue Emergency in Industry.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, Senior Applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wojcik are officers of the Podkarpacki Customs Office in Industry.
On 28 August they served in the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medice. The officer of the Customs and Treasury Service noticed a man lying unconscious in the pedestrian area.
A Chinese activist died in custody as a result of torture.
He wanted to exercise the rights guaranteed by the Constitution
On September 23, Cao Schuxia, an activist's wife, called the secretary of the Communist Party from her family village to announce that her husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
Which was the cause of death, he didn't reveal.
At Cao's morgue, she saw her husband's body massacred, undetectable.
"His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were all in the blood," the woman said.
"They didn't let me take my cell phones, and there were a lot of cops around that didn't get close to Wang."
The police insisted that they sign the statement that the husband was seriously ill and died as a result of “an accident”.
PLN 105 million for companies in the field of video games from the National Centre for Research and Development
Almost PLN 105 million of funding will reach companies from the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Centre for Research and Development announced on Friday the results of the III edition of GameINN.
Almost 30 projects supported by NCBR included developing a platform for creating field games based on the AR game engine creating a map of the real world together with an application for data transmission by users; a test-based training platform to verify the practical skills of VR and AI jobs; an innovative game simulating the management of real production processes using a innovative playing model based on the interaction of the virtual world with the real world using the industrial 4.0 concept – the NCB communication sent on Friday's PAP.
The aim of the GameINN Sector Programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game industry in the global market by 2023.
According to the NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 was PLN 1.85 billion and the forecast for 2019 was PLN 2.23 billion.
"The specially prepared GameINN research agenda and already reaching 300 million PLN support for entrepreneurs under this sector programme are an important impetus for further, dynamic growth of Polish gamedev," we read in the Communication.
Video games industry is an excellent example of the efficient use of the potential we have in Poland.
"The government's incentives for innovation entrepreneurs, such as B+Rs, competence improvement programmes, IP boxes or support programmes implemented by the NCBRs drive innovative companies and enable them to compete more effectively in a highly competitive market," said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the Communication.
The Head of Science points out that innovation money not only reaches innovators in the form of project funding, but also remains in their pockets – from relief to R & D in 2018 three quarters more entrepreneurs than a year earlier.
‘The amount of the deductible costs for R & D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which provided more than PLN 300 million for companies benefiting from this benefit.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in the three editions of GameINN", stressed the Deputy Prime Minister.
In addition, the Director of the NCBR, Dr. Wojciech Kamietski, recalls that in the two previous funding competitions with a total value of more than PLN 211.2 million, 78 innovative projects were awarded.
The huge interest of the III competition and the diversity of the applications submitted show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and enhance its competitive advantages.
"It is generally a pleasure to see projects identified, as in previous editions, with projects dealing not only with entertainment but also with Industry 4.0," he adds.
In the third GameINN contest for financing up to 20 million PLN, entrepreneurs, consortia of entrepreneurs and consortia of entrepreneurs with scientific entities could apply.
The NCBs received 87 applications for a total of approximately PLN 317 million.
The budget of the contest at the time the contest was announced was PLN 100 million, but it was increased so that 27 projects were granted almost PLN 105 million of funding.
Detailed information on the results of the GameINN III contest is available on the web site cncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN Sector Programme is implemented under the Intelligent Development Operational Programme.
The NCBR launched the programme in 2016 in response to the initiative of business associates associated with the Polish Games Agreement, which includes, among others, CD companies such as Project, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga confessed to stealing Kasper Dolberg's watch
The event took place on 16 September.
Dolberg, who arrived at the end of August from Ajaks Amsterdam to Nice, realized after training that his watch had disappeared from his locker room.
It's not like it's worth 70,000 euros.
The furious Daniek did not show up in class the next day, explaining his stomach problems.
It's been a mystery since the beginning.
The footballers in the dressing room have private safes at their disposal, and the club area is monitored.
According to AFP, he finally confessed to the theft of Diaby-Fadig.
The 18-year-old already apologized to Dolberg and his other teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised to return the money to the Danes for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising footballers of the young generation in France.
He went to Nicea as a 13-year-old to debut in the first team three years later.
This season he played seven matches.
He recently signed a professional contract, but – as reported by the newspaper L'Equipe – the club will probably solve it with immediate effect.
So far, he's initiated a disciplinary action against his opponent.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on this matter.
Make sure you wash your hands properly.
We all know that they should be washed (e.g. after coming home or before meals).
But not everyone knows that to actually get rid of germs, you have to do it properly.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are coming.
It takes at least 30 to 40 seconds to clean enough to remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands
And most of us are in short supply.
Just warm water and plain soap – it is not true that it must be antibacterial (many doctors even advise them).
We wash not only the bottoms and tops of our hands, but also: fingertips (connected or single) – rub them with colic movements with the inside of the other hand, the spaces between our fingers (swift your hands with your fingers), thumbs – each thumb is covered with the other hand and in such a embrace we turn for a moment to the right and left.
In an emergency situation (when you can't wash your hands) we should wipe your hands with a wet handkerchief and then use antibacterial gel (drugs, from 5 zł).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the door or door with your hands washed (command of the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open it through a paper towel.
President of Iran says he refused to speak to the US, Donald Trump denies
Tehran did not speak to the American side during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite the American offer of lifting sanctions, President Hassan Rowhani of Iran announced on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump commented that the Iranian side had asked for the abolition of the restrictions, which he did not agree to.
According to President Hassan Rowhani of Iran, Americans have proposed the abolition of all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.
It would regulate both the Iranian nuclear programme and the ballistic missile programme.
Rawhani: Iran will not hold talks in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
The President of Iran stated that he did not agree to these discussions because of the “toxic atmosphere”.
He announced that he had met with American diplomats because he had been called France, Germany, and Great Britain.
However, he stressed that Iran would not engage in talks in the atmosphere of "maximum pressure".
"Even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in 5+1, no one is able to predict what the final outcome will be," Rowhani said.
The day before, the Iranian leader said that he did not exclude talks with the US and that the European parties to the nuclear treaty had rejected favourable US sanctions on Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran following the appearance of the US with a nuclear contract “are a prerequisite which does not allow” to establish dialogue.
If we can overcome this prerequisite and if America lifts the sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America – he declared.
He added that he did not rule out a meeting with President Donald Trump of the United States, although he did not agree to such a conversation during the week during the UN General Assembly.
Trump: "Iran asked, I said no."
Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he refused to ask the Iranian side.
"Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course I said no!" the president of the United States tweeted.
Voltage with atomic agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to alleviate tensions between Washington and Tehran in some form to save the 2015 Iran agreement, which was signed by the signatories.
In exchange for lifting the economic sanctions, Iran was to abandon the nuclear weapons programme and the nuclear sector would be subject to the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the withdrawal of the US from the agreement in May 2015, its signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in force.
So far, none of this has worked.
Washington is applying a policy of exerting maximum pressure on Iran, and sanctions include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran announced that if it did not receive a permit to export raw materials, it would limit its obligations as a result of the agreement every 60 days.

The judge of the Regional Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of Emilia, who, according to her words and screens from WhatsAppa, participated in the stalking of judges, was returned on Wednesday to the ruling of the NSA.
The reason is that disciplinary action has not been initiated against him, so there is no basis for supporting the WSA President's order to remove him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesman at the NSA, initiated an investigation against Smydt at the end of August, but it has not turned into an action against him so far.
Although the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must take care of the decision of the President of the WSA within one month of its issuance.
In this situation, the judge, who publicly spoke about the psychological problems of his wife, to discredit her, who due to suspicions of participation in the Heiter group was removed from the KRS office, will return to judgment and will issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Smydt denies his involvement in the Heiter Group.
He claims there's no evidence of that except for the fake screens and the words of his wife he's divorcing.
That is exactly what the other judges associated with the "Cast" claim to be: all are innocent, there is no evidence.
And it's quite possible they'll put on their own.
Because the D.A. didn't shake her finger to secure the evidence from their electronic media, she's also silent about Emily Schmidt's phone contents, which kept the phone in June on another matter.
The police didn't shake their finger to secure the devices of the people they were being harassed by Judge Waldemar Zurek in February.
There's no evidence – there's no Smydt case, there's no Caste case.
Nor is it the case that the chief of NIK Marian Banas is renting the house to the pimps and hiding the proceeds.
CBA's checking his property statements.
And she'll check when she checks.
The Ethical Commission will not take care of Banas because the Sejm is suspended (but the State Control Commission has somehow gathered to take a curative decision to cancel Banasz' replacements and to appoint his lawyer, even though the law of such an odd combination does not provide).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, which I think is American, about how a wife gets home and stays with her lover in bed.
She's so stunned and devastated, she can't make a word out of her mouth.
She's standing in the doorway, and at the time, the lover comes out of bed and gets dressed and walks out.
And the husband was bedridden.
When the wife regains her voice and screams, what is that supposed to be?
Who is this woman?
The husband calmly asks: what woman, dear?
Only in the case of Caste or Banasa, there is a paradisaic state.
And that's not funny at all.
MAXIPIZZA: Signature with the statutory auditor of the agreement for the examination of the accounts for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021.

Kamila Ličwinko in the final jump higher
Earlier this season, a rival after a break from the mother's race, a bronze medalist from London 2017, won 1,85 and 1,89 and the second 1,92 in the first attempt.
1.94 was only successful in the third approach.
"I'm glad.
I showed that I could fight because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the final, I will have to jump better technically," she admitted in front of Eurosport Licwinko.
The American Vashti Cunningham and the Belarusian Karina Demidik were the best in the eliminations – after 1.94.
Both contestants, as the only ones, have lost no height.
The women's final jump was scheduled for Monday.
Beginning at 7.30 p.m. Polish time.
Kornel Morawiecki is in a hospital in a state of emergency.
He got to the hospital, and the doctors in his condition say it's hard.
He must be conscious and conscious.
"We believe it will come out of this, that it will win again.
We all pray that he return to his health", said an anonymous close person named Kornel Morawiecki in conversation with the journalists of the Super Express.
In the upcoming election, the Prime Minister's father is running to the Senate.
"I have the closest family and politics in my life," said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview given two weeks ago to the journalists "Super Express".
In January, Super Express reported that the 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki had gone to the Military Hospital in Wrocław for research.
"I had strange, disturbing symptoms and applied to the hospital.
Turns out I have a jaundice.
But the worst was before me.
When a CT scan was performed, it was found that I had a pancreatic cancer...", the father of the prime minister handed over.
A few days later, he underwent a major surgery at MSWiA hospital in Warsaw.
As Morawiecki said, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal priest Zbigniew Kras to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and ran well.
"I know that many people have prayed for me for which I thank you very much.
Fortunately, I don't have any more metastasize.
I don't know if I'm going through chemotherapy yet.
I turn myself in to the doctors of specialists who are rather good thoughts.
So far, after this heavy surgery, I have to get back to some state of use.
I hope everything will be all right," Kornel Morawiecki said in a conversation with the "SE" in January.
"If I were too late to submit to the study, the situation would be tragic and I would have longed for it by now...", he added.
Kraków: 14-year-old missing
Officers from the City Police Command in Krakow are looking for a 14-year-old Nel Stoklosa.
Anyone who has any information about the missing person is asked for contact.
She left her residence on 26 September and has not returned or made contact with any loved ones until now.
The last time she was seen was at the Old Guest Street in Kraków.
Nel Stoklos is 14 years old, measuring 167 cm, he has blond hair and greyish eyes.
When she was last seen, she was wearing a blouse, gray pants and shoes.
Anyone who has any information about the missing person is requested to contact the police at number 12 61-52-911, 12 61-53-616 or 112, 997.
The power of the lava jumps.
The title of the relationship with amateur sports competition, played on Sunday afternoon, September 15 at the hypodrom on Oleandry Street in Olava, may be confusing to some.
The true power of the road is far away, but that's the name of one of the kind of horse rivalry...
The competition for the power of leaps consists in overcoming the horse and riders with increasing obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two metres.
It is worth adding here that the world’s long-standing and still unbroken record, established in 1949 by the Chilean Albert Larragubel, is 247 cm long on the horse “Huaso”.
So high in Olava, of course, no one jumped, but the result of the best local amazons at a level of 135 cm is not one of the worst...
The professions organised by the unbridled Jan Sienkiewicz and other JKS activists “In the Sea ” were part of a show held earlier on page 22.
There were eight amazons involved in the competition, training riding in the JKS in Olavsky.
Four competed on the hooks and four on the big horses.
In the first group, Nikola Szoldra was best described, who received the crazy Sprinter.
This small but dynamic rum began to overcome the obstacles spread at a height of 40 cm, and ended only with a station with a top beam that was 125 cm away from the ground.
However, he did not give up easily and only after three consecutive refusals was dismissed by the jury from further rivalry.
The second place in the pony jumps was Amelia Pawlak, with the "Fama" and the third Lena Borun on the "Harmider".
Ambitiously she fought the youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, g swaying and jumping through obstacles to a small "Carmen" cage.
Even greater emotions accompanied the starting Amazons and the viewers during the big horses competition.
The horrendous declines were attributed to Paulina Szevczyk, who received the “Declaration” and Anastasia Abramenko, who went to “Lots”.
Fortunately, there was nothing wrong with either small beatings or Amazons or horses, so they continued to participate in the competition.
Many problems were encountered with the entry of the young Winita into the parking lot of Veronika Łukkiewicz.
She needed either an assistant trainer, or another horse for a couple that had a little crazy "Vineta" after.
After listing the obstacle from the parking lot, she also went down with a full pipe, so the moments in the boxing and the stretching room were dangerous. "Everything is under control!", calmed Jan Sienkiewicz a little with these frightened spectators, especially those youngest.
From the beginning of the big horse competition, Marta Masalska, who received a beautiful presentation of the "Whiskey", has done well in the parking lot.
This decent hammer, paired with an experienced Amazon, followed the second approach in the final stage as the first one skipped 135 cm and this was the best outcome at this point.
However, after the same height, Paulina Szevczyk was placed on “Declaration”, Veronika Łukkiewicz on “Vinet” and Anastasia Abramenko on “Lots”.
To decorate the fleet and after receiving the prizes in the form of riding equipment all these players went together, and in the end together with the Amazons on the pony at Radecki march performed an effective honorary round, ending these interesting and exciting competitions.
Thank you.
The "Siodle" Sports Club is very grateful to the sponsors of the jump power competition during the 16th "Further Jezdejskie".The City Office in Olawa, the Water Trains and Canalisation Plant in Olava, the District Starship and the company "Mustang".
Max Kolonko is cut off from the KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko
KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko is the name of the election committee under which the political formation #R Revolution Marius Max Kolonka was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution directed its proposal especially to young right-wing voters.
Before the elections, Kolonko announced his cooperation with Mark Jakubiak or Paul Kukiz, but none of these coalitions occurred, and the KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko himself was unable to even collect enough signatures to list in any constituency in Poland.
Kolonko has now announced on Twitter that he has completed his cooperation with the KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko.
"I'll expect WWW to delete my name from the name.
I would kindly ask you not to involve my person in the listed entity", he added and announced that more information would be provided soon.
It is not yet known whether the journalist will continue to act, whether it is the end of #R Revolution.
On July 4, on American Independence Day, U.S. journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko informed about the emergence of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years Kolonko has been famous for driving on the YouTube channel Max TV, commenting on events in Poland and the world.
"We have enough politicians, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the authorities in the country to embrace the nation and rule for the good of the nation," Kolonko said.
The party's programme included judicial issues (should be chosen in general elections), tax changes (comparison of tax-free amount for all), military reparation (in the form of military assistance for NATO Eastern countries, with particular reference to Poland), a referendum on the possession of weapons, limitation of the number of Members or the introduction of one-mandating electoral districts.
A few days after the announcement of a new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko approached Mark Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko placed on his profile in social media information suggesting that #R would combine forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions finally happened.
UBS: Gold close to balance point
"The euro envelope will remain close to PLN 4.35 in the coming months, which will be accompanied by a weak market economy", says Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.
"The expectations of maintaining a strong growth rate and stable monetary policy are in favour of stabilising gold quotations on the current ceiling," he said in a discussion with Bankier.pl.
In his view, despite the clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise the rates in an environment in which the vast majority of central banks ease policies.
"If gold is properly valued, euro quotations should be maintained in the coming months in the vicinity of PLN 4.35 – that is how attractive Polish bonds are, according to him.
Much more profitable than Polish paper yields bonds from emerging markets," estimated Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation for emerging markets with UBS Wealth Management.
According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the world’s economic situation.
"The global slowdown may be further deepened, but it should not come to a severe recession and, at the very least, the decline in GDP dynamics slightly below zero," Michael Bolliger said.
"Investors should disregard global shares that may be harmed by the lack of a business conflict solution on the US-China line and other geopolitical risk factors, including the Donald Trump impeachment and Brexite procedure.
Europe should behave relatively weak among the stock markets", according to the latest letter to investors of the main manager of UBS Wealth Management Mark Haefele.
"Actions from the euro area countries should behave worse than the US, because they are more vulnerable under conditions of increased uncertainty over global trade and fears of slowing down," we read in the paper.
According to Michael Bolliger, even to the minus of 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the profitability decline in the bond markets of the safest countries.
In the longer term, however, the profitability of long-term and only short-term securities should no longer fall, with a view to easing the monetary policy of banks.
The largest field to cut its feet has the Fed, which should lead to a weakening of the American currency in the next few years.
The long-term balance point for euro quotations is the $1.29 ceiling, which would mean a 19 per cent potential to strengthen the common currency to the dollar.
We expect further cuts in Fed's feet, which will reduce the differences in monetary policy in the world.
"To maintain the strength of the dollar within a long time may not allow the current and budgetary account deficit," Michael Bolliger announced.
The Bundeswehra is losing his weapon.
German MON Confidential Report
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehra has reported the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 parts of arms and 19,445 ammunitions, as a result of a confidential inventory of the RFN defence portfolio.
Information was provided by the press belonging to the media group EditorationsNetzwerk Deutschland (RDD).
According to a document from the Parliamentary Secretary of State's Office at MON Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one gun and 3,474 ammo have been retraced so far.
Among the military equipment that still remains missing are six MG3, 11 automatic rifles G3, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal-guns and two P8 pistols.
In addition, 30 barrels are missing for MG3 machine guns.
The vice-president of the Levic Party, Martin Renner, expressed concern with the situation.
As the RND said to journalists, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is "depressive".
Even more so, only a fraction of the lost equipment was found as a result of the investigations carried out.
Martin Renner summarised the effects of these actions as a "bad balance".
She also criticized the fact that it did not show whether or not there was a weapon found in the investigation against Lieutenant Bundeswehra Franco A. In December 2017, the Federal Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening the security of the state and of violating the provisions of the law governing access to firearms.
Officials have been asked to prepare attacks on leading German politicians from far-right and racist motives.
His "black list" of goals, which came into the hands of the prosecutor, included the then Minister of Justice Heiko Maas of the SPPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Annette Kahane, the defence of human rights and the founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung Foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. entered illegal possession of four firearms, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition and more than 50 explosives.
The crying kids on the plane.
How can they be avoided?
There's a solution.
Japan Airlines has recently been using a function designed for the people for whom travelling in the company of a crying child is a nightmare.
Through the website, the lines allow you to check the location distribution on the plane.
If the combination travels underage to the second year of age, the “child’s icon” appears on a specific, reserved seat by parents or guardians.
In this way, the person using the services of the carrier shall be able to choose a place away from that occupied by the young child.
The BBC reports that the lines have already informed about the shortcomings of this solution.
“Child’s icon” shall not appear when the ticket has been reserved by a third party or if the aircraft has changed at the last minute.
As expected, the idea divided the interstates.
Some Twitter users suggest that the problem of travelling with crying children can be solved with noise-reducing headphones.
Those are the kids we used to be.
"We must learn tolerance because soon we will need maps of seats for breathtaking mouths, salivating or drunkards," G Sundar wrote.
Another person on the Internet noticed that he had once been disturbed by crying children on an airplane, but he changed his mind when he became a parent.
There is also no lack of supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
"Thank you for warning me of the screaming children during the 13-hour trip," Rahat Ahmed wrote.
Major counts loss after bankruptcy of Thomas Cook's travel office
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not arrive in October on leave to Majorka as a result of Thomas Cook's bankruptcy office on Monday.
On Friday, Marc Pons, a representative of the Autonomous Government of Balearics, said that among the 25,000 temporary residents who will not be able to take the October holiday in Majorca, there are also those who were to travel with companies indirectly linked to Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80 percent of the expected timers who, due to the UK’s collapse, had to give up their vacation in Majorca next month are German citizens and Scandinavian countries.
However, according to Pons – since Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Baltic island during the November-April period, the loss to the local economy will be lower.
He announced that the Balearic Government had already started negotiations with international operators on "entering the market of Majorca" after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
The Diario de Mallorca newspaper estimates that more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourist crisis in Majorca.
About 800 are dismissed employees of Thomas Cook's office in Palma.
Others will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, together with Thomas Cook’s announcement of bankruptcy in many major hotels, property owners requested guests to pay an extra bed payment.
This situation has been experienced by several decades of tourists from Poland.
The Balearic Government estimates that, by Thursday, dozens of hotels in Majorca had stopped operating until at least the end of October in connection with Thomas Cook’s bankruptcy announcement and his cooperating companies.
On the other hand, the Friday's daily Diario de Ibiza shows that most of the Ibiza-based hotels that worked with the Thomas Cook group do not intend to close the facilities in the coming weeks.
The paper reminds us that on this balearic island, British bankruptcy was co-operated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the Balearic authorities announced that they would call on the Spanish Government to support the region by EUR 100 million to cover the losses caused by Thomas Cook’s travel agency bankruptcy.
They found that the most affected in this tourist archipelago, about 36,000 people, was located in Majorca.
Data from the Balearic Government show that Thomas Cook is lagging behind local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of the July-September 2019 agreements of around EUR 5 million.
Ranking FIFA women.
Poland continues on 29th, USA headed
Women's representation of Poland takes 29th place in the International Football Federation (FIFA) ranking on Friday.
At the same position, the team of coach Milos Stępiński was classified in the previous July set.
Poor swordsman.
How's October?
The leaders were the Americans who recently defended the title of champions of the world.
The second place in the ranking was Germany, and the third was Dutch.
The Poles are preparing themselves for the qualification of ME.
They were to start with a exit match with the Czechs on September 3rd.
The day before the meeting it was – due to food poisoning – postponed by one year.
In this situation, the Polish will introduce qualifications to meet with the Spanish on 12 November in Lublin.
Before that, the White-Reds will play two matches – on October 3 with Cyprus and five days later in Kelcas with Brazil.
In the Group of Pole rivals there are representatives of Spain, the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
The winners of the group and the three best teams from the second place advance directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six teams from the second position will play in the marauders for the last three tickets to the European championships.
The cost of 16 participants will be supplemented by the host – England.
The Polish male representation in the September FIFA ranking fell from 20 to 22th place.
‘Z’: Smog overthrows the government
"The effects of the Clean Air program are nickel, and the coal furnaces will kick as if nothing," we read on the front page of today's "RoyalPolyte".
"So far, 82,000 applications have been submitted under Clean Air, with a total value of PLN 2 billion, of which 48 thousand have been positive.
The accepted applications total more than PLN 915 million", says "Rz", referring to data from the Minister of Environment's spokesman.
As the paper points out, only part of the costs incurred are reimbursed from the programme.
The results of the programme's stupidly announced journal are considered "credible".
Self-governments, quoted by “Rz”, see the failures of the Clean Air, among others, in too large bureaucracy.
‘The programme should be much simpler: electronic notification, sending invoices by mail, possibly random implementation control.
This would improve the action", says the Mayor of Lidzbark Warminski Jacek Wiśniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smog Alarm note that in the first year less than 1% of the target was achieved to replace 3 million boilers.
As the ‘Rz’ notes, although the programme budget is 103 billion PLN for 10 years, meaning 10 billion PLN per year, this amount is virtual.
"In the budget of the National Environment and Water Management Fund for this year was reserved with 1.4 billion PLN for this year," we read.
Congress agrees to F-35 for Poland
Blaszczak: Now Price Negotiations
The US Congress agreed to sell Poland to 32 state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft.
"This is one of the last steps before the conclusion of the contract, but not the end of our work," Mariusz Błaštzek wrote on Twitter.
"We will negotiate hard to achieve the most favourable price," the Polish minister added.
Agreement on Polish F-35
The Polish air force is designed to supply 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters produced by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, Poland agreed to sell them to the US Department of State.
The Communication underlines that investment will contribute to national security and foreign policy in the United States by improving the security of NATO's ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to information from the State Department, Poland is to pay $6.5 billion for hunters.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department indicated that the contract would also include the supply of spare parts and repairs, training equipment, engineering, logistic and personnel services and related elements of logistics support and the programme and training of staff.
Hunter Lockheed Martin F-35
Thinker F-35 Lightning II produced by Lockheed Martin is a single-seat and single-engine multi-tasker of the fifth generation.
The aircraft is capable of carrying out close support, bombings and typically flight combat tasks.
With the use of Stealth technology, a hunter is undetectable for short range radars.
A recent F-35 fighter bought Belgium under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace them with the aged F-16.
Other US allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, are also to be considered for the purchase of American combat aircraft.
Barbie versus stereotypes.
Gender dolls
Barbie's producer introduced a series of neutral sex dolls into the market.
That's how he wants to fight stereotypes.
Barbie producer introduced a series of neutral sex dolls into the market
Next to Barbie with different skin color, shape or hairstyle, Mattel introduced neutral dolls to sell sex.
"Creatable World" toys wear wigs.
So children can decide whether their Barbie should have short hair or long hair.
Their wardrobe consists of both pants and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can become boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different colors of the skin and with different clothes.
The gender characteristics of the dolls have also been abandoned – the gender dolls no longer have full mouths, long shrubs and thin waists or, in Ken's case, broad arms.
The company believes that children do not like their dolls to have sex standards imposed, and some parents and feminists believe that toys made for a particular sex inhibit girls' ambitions and reinforce traditional stereotypes.
"The new dolls will allow all children to feel free," said Mattel.
The barbie doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in a bathing suit and high heels shoes, has been repeatedly criticized in the past for promoting “non-natural female stereotypes” such as unnatural proportions of the body.
The concert has responded to criticism and has already put dolls of different skin colors on the market, as well as more rounded shapes.
There were also dolls in the hijab.
Zandberg: round or club Together may have several Members
Zandberg questioned on the ZET radio , how many candidates of his party can get to the left-wing sejm (KW SLD from which the candidates for the SLD, Spring and Left Together, starting with the common logo “Lewica”), replied that this depends on the outcome of the committee.
"I believe the score of Levica will be very good, because we feel that people have the hope that Levica is not only right anymore, but also strong," he said.
According to Zandberg, the left hand may have 60-80 Members.
‘This may mean that the circle or club Together will have a dozen Members.
But it's up to Poles and Poles.
I won't guess and tell you how this is going to happen," he said.
Asked whether Levica Together would have a separate circle, Zandberg replied: “We are agreed to be diverse, and we will not pretend that there is no diversity.
I think the Poles have awarded this diversity because we have shown that, in different ways, we have been able to agree on a common agenda."
Asked whether the biggest beneficiary of the joint start was the leader of the SLD Włodzimer Wizard, Zandberg replied that, in his opinion, the biggest beneficiaries were the centrolewic and left-wing voters.
On the other hand, given that the SLD would receive the entire subsidy, he denied that "the political party's goal is to represent its constituents".
Zandberg admitted that he would vote for Sejm in the election.
In the case of elections to the Senate, he said he was wondering.
"The offer is diverse and in this offer there are candidates and candidates to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to whom my heart continues," he said.
"I say very honestly and clearly that if I were in District 44 of the Senate, I would take the electoral certificate and vote in another district," emphasised the politicians.
"I would not have tried to give my vote to Minister Kazimierz Uzdovski (KO-PAP candidate), he added.
In this district outside the Uzdovský are the leaders of the RP Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki of the PIS.
Dakar: The largest mosque opened in West Africa · Global Voices
Tens of thousands of Senegalese people gathered on Friday in the capital for the inauguration of a huge mosque, considered the largest in West Africa.
Muslims arrived by bus, car and foot to Bop district, where a new mosque could accommodate 30,000 faithful ones.
The building was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, belonging to the Sufic Nurtu Islam, which dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a wet area of six hectares passed by the government.
The name of the Mossalikul Jinan (The Path to Paradise) is derived from the title of the poem of Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the brotherhood, worshiped by the believers as holy.
The mosque is surrounded by Carrary marble and has five minarets.
The tallest of them is 78 meters.
The mosque in the middle will hold 15,000 faithful, and the rest may be on the outer esplanad.
In richly finished interiors you can admire the gilded dome, giant chandeliers and decoration handmade by Moroccan workers.
The builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the gm still has no comparison to mosques in other regions.
In Morocco the Hassana II Mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105,000 faithful.
The construction of a mosque, which cost more than EUR 30 million, was financed from private donations.
The government, in addition to the land, has provided lighting, sanitation equipment and financed road works worth EUR 10.5 million.
Coach Smile: Our problem is not Śląsk, it's us.
Eight league matches without the victory of the Crown footballer will try to stop in Friday's meeting with the vice-leader of Sląsko's extraclassor.
"Our problem is not getting back on track, but we ourselves, we must work on what we play," said Mr. Mirosław Smyla, the coach.
The last and so far the only victory in the league was recorded in the first row, when the 1-0 Benjamins of the Games of Częstochowa were on their way out.
Later, the kilns recorded two remissions and six failures, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 with Zaglól Lubin in 1/32 finals of the Polish Cup.
"I'm very optimistic that in the last seconds the football players were fighting for the goal, they wanted to resuscitate.
Their fall on the wall after the last whistle was not due to a breakdown, but it was a fall of anger because they were so close," said Smiling.
As he pointed out, Śląsk has very strong wings, which is why he is going to sensitize the team to the game in the side sectors of the field.
"We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we are also looking at what we want to play," the coach added.
In Friday's game in Koron, it certainly won't be a guarding match for the excess of yellow cards of Ognjen Gnjatic, in the frame will also lack the injured Jakub Žubrowski and Michael Gardawski.
But it's a wake-up call in a blistering game of a few players with the desire to play.
"We have a headache, recently it seemed that he would not be, and now he is," said Smiling.
Crown Counsel Daniel Strangel stressed that Śląsk would not be an easy rival for breaking the eight league matches in a row without victory, but in an extraclassion anyone could win with anyone.
"We are a good team.
We may not show it on the field in recent weeks, but the moment will come that we will win and we believe it will be on Friday," the footballer said.
After nine rows of the Crown's extremities with a score of five, he takes a 15-point position.
Sląsk collected 12 more and shuffled in the second place.
The Friday match in Kielca will begin at 8.30 p.m.
These trees can completely disappear from Europe.
“42% of the species of trees on the European tree are at risk”, warns the International Conservation Union (IUCN) in the "Red Book of European Trees" published on Friday.
There are, among other things, chestnuts and berries at the top of the list.
IUCN, a organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.
It was drawn up by specialists who, based on research, concluded that out of the 454 species of trees found in Europe (as well as in other parts of the world), 42% are "highly endangered".
Among the causes of the Red Paper is the rapid expansion of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, the most endangered are those trees and shrubs that exist only or mainly on our continent.
With regard to the typical European treeland, 58% of the species are at risk, and 15 percent, 66 species of trees and shrubs, according to IUCN experts, are threatened with extinction.
Among the main causes of the deforestation, the book mentions errors in logging operations, accelerated urbanization, too intense tree cutting, and further forest fires and changes in European ecosystems.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, flies and grasslands is also severely threatened.
"The consequences of human activities lead to the gradual decline of species of European plants and pose a danger in Europe to the disappearance of important and underestimated varieties, which form the basis of European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet," said Luc Bas, who is leading the IUCN European office.
Grzegorz Schetina: I do not promise 600+
"Today, the PSI wants to buy out Poles, offering them for freedom to hand out credits that will have to pay off future generations," says Grzegorz Schetina in an interview with the "Rzeczpospolita".
In his opinion, "the whole PiS policy is a pizza".
At the same time, politicians promise that "what is given will not be taken".
Schetin ensures in conversation with Jack Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea of defeating the law and justice.
It's about mobilisation of the electorate at the polling stations.
In his view, the opposition has greater potential in this respect than the Kaczynski Party.
"Today, conscious people who want to live in a normal country are more than PSI supporters, a party that has been negligent to the declared values, such as modesty, humility, transparency," Schetin says.
The Leader of the Civil Coalition and the President of the Civil Platform also outlined the basic objectives of the KO electoral programme.
"First of all, nothing data will be taken, but we need to set a course for the future, because the PSI is only dealing with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, as seen after a dramaticly low investment," he said.
Secondly, it is “to fuel the energy of Poles, to help and invest in those who work hard, and those who are entrepreneurs”.
Schetin explains that the KO programme includes a project that will give the least earning Poles more than 614 zlotys per hand and more earners after several hundred.
He also pointed out that he did not want to race for distribution.
Like he said, he'll do as much as he can, but he won't promise 600+.
"I will never allow the Greek option, where the leaders bid with opposition to distribution until finally the country's financial collapse," he stressed.
Schetin also said in an interview for "Rz" that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki were afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.
"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
“Fear moves before a fall.
Kaczyński is a man of state like Banas is a crystal," he added.
The PO leader also said that he had not yet decided whether to apply for the platform's leadership.
Argentina: Six Dead Large Condors · Global Voices
In the province of Santa Cruz in Argentina, six large condors were found dead – reports TVN24.
Experts believe that human activity has contributed to their deaths.
Large Condors are likely poisoned by the means of killing predators such as pumas, foxes, or wild dogs.
Animals could eat toxic cavities.
In addition to one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were adults.
"It is a great loss for the environment, because the Condor must reach 10-15 years to become fertile and capable of reproduction.
So we are losing a protected species, a endangered species," says Luis Jacome, director of BioAndina Foundation, Argentine environmental organization.
"I think that the use of toxic bait and poison poses a risk not only to this species, but to all other forms of life, including human health," he adds.
‘A’: they want the jewel for the President
Work has been done to grant the head of the state a precious chain.
The idea was supported by Andrzej Dudy's office – we read in the "Roczpolite".
As the newspaper explains, it is the gold chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal instigation officially called during the period of the interwar jewel of the Republic.
Last time he was probably used by President Ignacy Mystic.
The "Roz" says that such a chain could soon be hit on Andrzej Dudy's shoulders.
The Senate Commission on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and Petition voted on Wednesday to work on the amendment of the Law on Orders and Restrictions to bring it back.
The daily reports that this is not the first attempt to restore this chain of heads of state.
The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it had lost its voice.
This time the work is flashy.
At the beginning of August, the senators devoted several minutes to the matter, acknowledging that they would consult the Office of the President.
This came in mid-September.
"I inform you politely that the Office of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position put forward in the petition in question," said Prime Minister Andrzej Dera.
Wednesday the case continued with the Senate commission and again devoted little time to the matter.
"The President's Office replied briefly: it is behind this to restore it," said Commissioner Robert Mamątov of the PSI, quoted by the "Rz".
He applied for legislative work, which the committee supported.
Cops will teach drivers how to drive through a crossroad
The police action will be conducted, among other things, at the intersection of al. Teeplinski of al. Pilsudski.
The uniform actions have something to do with the recent complaints of the city's authorities on drivers who are not always able to behave properly at the intersection.
On Friday, September 27, the police are launching a preventive action in the Rzeszów “Travel Crossings”.
It is about eliminating traffic difficulties: entering the intersection without the possibility of a descent, not applying to light signals or road signs.
"We often think that we are alone at the intersection, and we actually make life difficult for other drivers," said Marek Ustrobinski, vice president of the city a few days ago.
His words were expressed at a press conference in which the city authorities presented examples of inappropriate driving of cars after crossings, which, in effect, creates traffic.
At that time, the president appealed to travellers to reason on the road and, among other things, to move faster on the lights or not to write text messages while driving.
The theme has somehow been taken over by the Soviet police, who are starting the "Travel Crosses" event today.
What is it?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the phenomenon of cross-crossing by drivers entering them without the possibility of continuing their driving.
This is a frequent offence that has contributed to the aggravation of traffic difficulties and the creation of traffic jams.
He is at risk of a mandate of 300 zlotys and 2 penalty points.
In addition, the uniforms will pay attention to the non-compliance with light signals or road signs and incorrect parking in the area of intersections.
They will also observe the lack of fluidity of the vehicle, the late movement from the signalers, the free passage of the intersections and the leaving too much distance between the vehicles.
What kind of cross-sections are there going to be action?
M.in. on Lisa-Kuli street from Jagiellonian street; al. Cieplinski from Pilsudski al.; ul. Targów from Pilsudski street; Srniewit Square from Dąbrowski street or Hetmanski street from the Warsaw Uprisings.
This type of share in the capital of Podkarpacia will be held next Friday.
They've checked out the "Creeks" waste management company.
"The officers of the Department of Environmental Protection of the Antiquity of Volomiński County and the District Building Surveillance Inspectorate checked the installation in the village of Zielonka on Friday, where waste from the sewage treatment plant "Szajka" in Warsaw is disposed of," said the spokesman Karol Szishko.
Inspectors from the Mayor of Volomín carried out an inspection in an establishment located in the forests of the village of Zielonka.
The “Dar-Transport Facility” under a contract with the municipal sewage treatment plant “Jacca” performs waste management services.
"The installation was examined, and the entrepreneur was also asked to provide documentation related to his activities," Szishko said.
He added that the inspection report would be forwarded, among other things, to the Provincial Inspectorate of Environmental Protection in Warsaw.
The latest survey in Dar-Transie was carried out by the Provincial Inspectorate of Environment in Warsaw during the period 29 December 2015 – 11 February 2016.
It was established at the time that the company did not take samples, measurements and studies of groundwater, nor did it have the results of studies of stabilized municipal sewage sediments from the sewage treatment plant “Scatter”.
After the inspection of the WISE, Dariusz Saturday was called to stop the violation of the terms of the decision.
DAR-TRANS Private Trade and Transport Facility Dariusz Sobota is one of the waste-receiving companies in the form of stabilized municipal sewage sediments from the "Scret" treatment plant.
In accordance with the decision to dispose of waste in the area of production, waste up to 60,000 tonnes per year is processed in the forests near Zielonki.
On last Thursday, the Warsaw Municipal Water and Sanitation Company informed that at the turn of November and December 2018, STUOS was excluded from operation, which was associated with damage to one of the combustion plant’s equipment.
As reported by MPWik, the monthly cost of their exports is PLN 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Walusa supported Malgorza Kidaw-Blonska.
"You've taken up a difficult task, you can count on my total support," Lech Walus told Kidawy-Blonska Małgorzata on Friday.
"Mr President, this is a very important word for me," replied the candidate of the Civil Coalition to the Prime Minister, leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that in terms of the situation in Poland, it is now "only a kibic on pensions".
Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska met with former President Lech Walusa at his office at the European Solidarity Centre in Gdansk on Friday.
In a short conversation behind the closed door, the son of Wałęsy – Jarosław also took part.
"You've taken up a difficult task," he said after meeting Lech Walus.
"You can count on my total support," he added.
"The problems before Poland are known to all of us.
That is why it is a great hope that you, as a woman, will deal with these problems, and we all, who love Poland, will support you as much as possible," the former president said, turning to Kidawa-Blonska.
Very Important Words
Kidawa-Blonska thanked you for your support.
"Mr President, this is a very important word for me because no one like you can talk about freedom, about the Constitution and know how important it is," she said.
"Let us show that we can make different, wise policies, together, but according to the Constitution, according to the law, according to respect for others.
You've done your revolution, and we want to change Poland," said Kidawa-Błońska.
Retirement kibic
In a conversation with journalists, Valouse said that he is now "only a sausage on his pension".
"Of course I look at it.
I hope that we will reverse the course of events, that what was good, tested, we will return.
The threefold division of power is the most important, the Constitution is the most important, the courts are urgently needed.
And all of this has to be cleaned up, all of this has to be restored to normal action, and I believe that this time we're going to do it.
Because if not, then the street criteria are waiting for us," said Lech Walus.
"This is why it is so important for the Poles to go to the elections, to think about it, and to make their own decision.
And this is the most important," Kidawa-Blonska dropped off.
"The last chance that we will improve the state of affairs in Poland with the card," the former president replied.
"We must build on a new foundation"
Asked about the most important changes to be made in Poland, Kidawa-Błońska said: "The President said very well.
We need to build a new foundation on which we can do all the other things.
Since the three divisions of power do not exist, since the Constitution is not respected, we need to go back to the beginning and make it clear that it will become obvious and that everyone will know that otherwise Poland will not move forward."
ME mammals: Slovenia – Poland 3:1 in the semifinals.
On the hot ground in Ljubljana, Polish netters worked with the Slovenians in the semifinals of Europe's championships.
There was no controversy and discussion with the judges, with Pole coach Vital Heynen as the lead.
"White Red" lost 1:3 and will play a bronze medal.
The Senate has decided on key laws
The Senate adopted without amendments the Act on the disclosure of the assets of the families of the most important state officials and on flights of the most important persons in the country.
52 senators voted in favour of the amendment of the law on the assets of the families of state officials – without amendments – 14 against, three abstained.
Thus, the senators decided to reject the 12 amendments tabled during the Wednesday debate by Senator PO Sławomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendments were intended to “civilize” and to limit the scope of the information given in the statement on the property situation of the own children, the children of the spouse, children adapted to the cases in which the children remain in the common household with the person obliged to make the declaration.
The Act on the disclosure of the assets of the families of the most important state officials whose project was founded in the Prime Minister's office was adopted by Sejm on 11 September.
The provisions assume that, among others, the Prime Minister, ministers, Members, MEPs, senators, presidents: the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as those who are headed by other state institutions, will be required to provide in a statement of the property of their spouses, children and those who remain in common use.
Nor did the Senate propose amendments to the Law on Flights of the Most Important Persons in the State.
It regulates what flights have the status of HEAD and who may be on board government aircraft with the most important persons in the country.
The Act also specifies who is responsible for the conduct of the Central Registry of Flights.
After the bill – no amendments – 55 senators were elected, 12 were opposed, four abstained.
According to the law, each flight of the president will be a "official mission" flight.
In flight, the President will be able to accompany family members and other persons invited by the President.
On the other hand, the mission of the official prime minister and the marshals of Sejm and the Senate will only fly “to carry out tasks directly related to their function”.
The Act also specifies the list of persons who may accompany the most important persons in the country during the flight.
According to the provisions on board the aircraft, members of delegations may be invited, Members, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organisational services; and journalists.
According to the Act, in case of doubts concerning the flights of Sejm and Senate marshals, the Head of KPRM will apply for clarification.
If such doubts are not clarified at the specified time, the Head of KPRM will be obliged to inform the Head of the Sejm Office or the Senate of the lack of possibility to organise such a flight.

Poles after their first training in Paris, waiting for the last rival
Polish volleyballers held their first training in Paris on Friday, where they will perform in a bronze medal game on Saturday.
Vital Heynen's trustee to win the title closed a Thursday's defeat with Slovenians 1:3 in Lublan.
It was loud about their troubles traveling to this game.
This time it was without such problems – on Friday morning they went with the Slovenians charter to Paris, and a few hours later they had a training session in the famous Bercy Hall.
According to the students in the class, the world's champions were irritated.
As the assistant of Heinen Michał Meesko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not just to train the retinal elements.
"We went to the hall, but for the most part it was time for the team.
It was about spending more time with him than training.
To talk, to think about how to rebuild all this as a team," he related.
He confirmed that half-final failure was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.
"We have been brutally brought to the ground.
Without saying two words, we're disappointed.
We still believed we'd go back to this game.
We discussed this game with each other at headquarters, and the coach talked a lot to the players.
As the two main causes of failure, I would indicate inefficiencies in the attack and much worse than usually dealing with the situation football.
The speakers were much better than us in this respect," he analysed.
In his opinion, the "White Red" did not stand in the way of the stress of the action against the loud and numerous audiences of the tournament's co-operators.
He admitted that the world's champions could get some sleep on the smooth road to the semifinals.
“Perhaps if we had a similar style of failure in the group phase, we would have better analyzed this lesson and later we would have played in the next stage of the tournament.
But it's only a cockroach," he warned.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with Thursday's defeat of Poles will lead to aggression in a bronze match.
"I hope that we will then show our true face.
There's nothing to fight about.
Recently we won the ME medal in 2011", he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by Poles during these championships.
In the group phase they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, went to Apeldoorn for the first two group meetings, and moved to Ljubljana for the semifinal.
Nick Kyrgios: a severe punishment, but suspended
The Australian tennis player received a 16-week launch ban and a fine of $25,000 – in a semi-annual suspension – for impetuous words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tournaments.
ATP World Tour players are losing their patience for Kyrgyzstan, but they're still giving him a chance to improve.
A summary of the most unbiased professional tennis player in recent years seems dangerous – 16 weeks of breaks plus fines, but both penalties are suspended for six months – a trial period in which a craftsman can improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he's been working for a long time and he's earned his own tennis record of the world – he had to pay the highest in the history of discipline a single financial penalty for breaking the rules of conduct on the court and next to him.
Loud curses, strange gestures, non-sport behavior, insulting judge and viewers, breaking two rockets during the losing match with Karen Chachanov – all for this after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid $113,000.
In the US Open 2019, he also did not play long, but he was able to say publicly that ATP activists were "corrupted", which affected the organisation's authorities so much that they carried out a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgyzstan and, after a few weeks, handed down the said verdict on suspension of the launch and the next fine.
However, his words about corruption were forgiven, after hearing the accused and learning the context of the statement.
However, tennis activists were justified by the fact that the investigation showed that the behaviour of Kyrgyzstan over the past 12 months in many cases raised serious objections and constituted almost a continuous violation of the rules that, without interruption, it insulted the vulgar person associated with tournaments and spectators, hence the high penalty.
However, the ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately delayed the execution of the judgment, ordering the fulfillment within the next six months of several conditions: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios, no longer can violate the rules of the code of conduct of professional tennis players, in particular it can no longer curse, destroy rockets, argue with the judges and the public, nor can any other way behave rudely and vulgarly.
He also received a recommendation to seek "long support" from mental trainers during tournaments and also outside the season to consult with people specializing in solving the problems of athletes who do not handle proper behaviour.
Nick Kirgios’ first comment on the verdict was: “Hey, everybody, I can still play.
I just need to control my behavior, that's all."
In practice, Australia will have at least a two-week break, since the Barque was exacerbated in the Lavera Cup, he had to give up the near start in Beijing (30 September-6 October) and Shanghai (6-13 October).
In the ATP ranking, Kyrgios takes 27th place.
This year he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, he made over 1.3 million dollars, so even after the fines he'll have a lot.
GUS: In Poland, life is getting better and better
The GUS report on household budgets published on Friday shows that as a good or rather good material situation, up to 44% of them assessed their material situation.
This percentage was 37.2% in 2016 and 33.5% in 2016 and since 2009, when the statistical office first examined the subjective assessment of the situation of households, it was never more than 30%.
A total of 8.1% of households considered their material situation to be bad or worse, compared to 11.2% in the previous year and more than 20% in 2009.
The best is the material situation of households of people working on their own account.
In this group, over 70% of respondents consider it good or rather good.
On the other hand, there are renters' households, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.
The number of children also has a significant impact on the subjective assessment of the material situation of households.
The worst is known by parents alone raising offspring, of whom 32% declare a good or rather good material situation.
Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55% to 60%, and among childless households it is 48.8%.
The impact of the 500+ programme is clearly evident in these statistics.
Before it was launched (in 2016), the parents of the single parent and of the child families (with at least three children) assessed their worst material situation.
Improving the subjective assessment of the material situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid growth of income, especially from work.
This is not all, however, because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good increases faster than real incomes.
Moreover, at the level of the provinces there is no clear correlation between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best reviews are made by residents of the Opole Voivodeship, where 48.9% of the respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.
Further, there are Lubuskie Voivodship (47.7%), Silesian (47.6%), Mazowiecki (47.3%) and Western Pomorie (47.1%).
In Poland, however, the administrative income (i.e. after tax and contributions are paid) was under 94% of the national average and 98% in Lubusk.
The highest incomes were made by the people of Mazowiecki (120% of the national average) and Silesian (104%).
In Poland, on average, the fixed income per person was PLN 1693 in 2018.
In real terms (after correction of price changes) it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
Based on previous years, the score is quite low.
Income per person increased by 7% in 2016 and a year later by 6.3%.
While the increase in revenue slows down, it also slows down expenditure.
These per capita amounted to PLN 1187, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first such case since 2013.
Expenditure per person increased by 1.9 per cent in 2017 and 4.3 per cent in 2016.
Studies of household budgets suggest that a statistical household currently spends 70.1 % of its administrative revenue, while in 2014 it was over 80 % and up to 2006 it exceeded 90 %.

USA: Three suicides among the airport crew
Three sailors committed suicide last week on board USS George H. W. Bush – an American Navy reported.
Over the last two years, five crew members of this ship have been killed in total.
The previous suicide took place in July of this year and earlier in November of 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
Each of the events occurred on land when the USS George H. W. Bush was crammed off the coast of Virginia.
So far, third parties have been excluded from the case.
Moreover, death is not to be linked.
"It is necessary for everyone to be involved in presenting suggestions and ideas, how we can prevent another suicide.
I would like to point out that there is no stigmatization or any other repertoire related to the search for help", wrote Captain Sean Bailey, ship commander on Facebook.
Nessolese critical of the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing
In his conversation with Peter Lekszyski, Stefan Nisiołowski stressed that Jan Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists in 1981.
"In fact, every opinion of him was accepted."
Then came criticism of some of his actions.
"For my sake, John Paul II was unable to eliminate Rydzysko's harmful activities, he is a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this redemptorist – the pest of the Church and Poland – has developed his media in the best ever since Pope Pole's life," he explained.
The former PO politician admitted: “There were dissatisfactions, the pope said something, once the Rydzyka did not accept, but he had power and could simply throw him out of the church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to raise money for the poor.
But John Paul II did not do so, nor did his successor," Nissyolowski explained.
"Against this, this terrible case of pedophilia and the actions of the Church, and in fact they are lacking.
I've been thinking a little bit ahead, but I wanted to point out the fullness of his life.
The scale of pedophilia in the Church has been relatively recent.
The question arises as to how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting things," he said in a conversation with a journalist.
In the assessment of the former policy PO Polish Church is an ally of the PSI.
"It must be admitted that during the time of Solidarity the Church was our most important ally.
All the festivities began with the Holy Mass, hanging crosses everywhere.
Now these crosses are written, they became a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the writing regime.
I repeat: one of the most unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzidjk shake the Polish Church that John Paul II did nothing in this matter and that today the Church is an ally of the PiS.
It is the black chapter of the Polish Church for which the elephant will come to pay for it", convinced Nessiołowski.
"I hope that Pope Francis will pursue the Yędraszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this kind," he concluded.
HISTORY: Morning celebrations 590th anniversary

The PZPN sleeps cursing behind the brothels at the stadiums.
Disqualified Grapes
The start of the Polish Cup between Griff Wejherow and Lechia Gdańsk’s small hair did not end tragically when the whales of Wejherow’s race of millimetres passed through the goalkeeper of the opposing team, Zlatan Alomerovica.
After this incident, the match was interrupted for 20 minutes.
The investigators of this case, the PZPN Commission, imposed a severe penalty on Grifa, excluding him from future games.
The club will not be able to start in the Polish Cup in 2020/2021.
In addition, the matches will not be released in the next match for their own stadium.
And they won't be able to go groups to league matches until December 31st.
The burdes at the stadium of Videva Łódź also caused the sausages of Sląska Wroclaw.
However, this was a more mild sentence, as Śląsk warned that similar events could occur and affected the relevant authorities in this regard.
However, the services allowed the lodgian kibiti sector to be abandoned by the ducks, the burning of chairs and the pushing of the economy sector.
This match was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervention police had to use the water cannon.
The PZPN punished Śląsk with a one-time stadium ban in the next match in the Polish Cup and prohibited the organization of the tournaments in this game and the next edition of the PP.
The ban on departures also covered the Extraklas league matches, but it will continue until December 31st.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Poland
DGKiA plans to exchange markings on the entire managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKIA Rzeszów
In Podkarpacia, implementation of the amendment of the Ministry of Infrastructure regulation on, among other things, the recording of foreign names on road signs also in Poland has begun.
E.g. “Lviv” will appear next to “L’viv”.
In our province, the changes will be introduced to 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear it, it should be easier, easier and easier.
The new guidelines result from the amendment of the Ministry of Infrastructure regulation on specific technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety equipment.
"We should remember that the names of the localities in the neighbouring countries are often also Polish.
Thanks to the changes we have made, they will almost appear on the roadways at our roads.
The introduction of the new marking starts with the Podkarpacki section of the A4 motorway", said Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.
Changes will be introduced on the 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and the national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total investment costs?
200,000 PLN.
First, the new marking will be implemented on the A4 motorway as planned by 1 November 2019.
What is the realization of the idea?
It's going to be without switching plates, on the principle of inserts.
They will now replace the existing names of new towns, written in Polish on already existing characters.
Both names will be saved in one row – first in Polish, then in original, in parentheses.
This will be a great relief for people who do not know the written names of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are located.

Someone shot a swan from the windmill.
In the pond in Zamczno in Lower Silesia, the residents noticed a swan having problems with its wings.
After catching and visiting the vet, it turned out that someone had made a target of an animal – a windmill bolt was found in his body.
"The information on the early bird was received from the villagers from the Wild Animals Rehabilitation Center in New Soli.
The report showed that the animal had broken wings.
We've gone to the scene.
Right away, you could see something was very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely so as not to hurt him and not to put extra stress on him.
The swan was caught and taken to the vet.
After the first photo of RTG, it was already known that someone had made a target out of him.
In his body there were fragments of the rubble," says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol managing the rehabilitation centre, among others.
Celebrate in the center
"The wounds were cleaned, the birds were given antibiotics, they had access to water, a safe place in the center where they would spend the whole winter.
We're trying to strengthen him.
He can't fly yet.
Letting him go now would be linked to the fact that he probably wouldn't survive the winter," said Walasek.
Staff are planning to let him go to the same pond in the spring.
The authorities of Žukowice municipality, after receiving information on the contribution of the animal's poor health, intend to inform the prosecutor about the matter.
The event occurred in Zamčno
Gowin: "We must stimulate Polish, small trade"
"The effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to encourage Polish trade," Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Jarosław Gowin Agreement, said on Friday.
Gowin, during the talks in the "Day Signals" on Radio Odinka, said that trade is controlled by international networks that impose such low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot actually develop.
While it was very difficult to deal with this problem, the Deputy Prime Minister recalled that the government of the PSI had tried to face it at the beginning of the term of office, but had received a "contrary from the EC".
"We have won before the Court of Justice, and I hope that if the United Rights wins the nearest elections and formulates the government, we will return to the subject," he said.
At the same time, he pointed out that "the effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the Polish problem, i.e. small trade".
"In addition, it will be necessary to consider whether the government, the state, has some instruments to encourage Polish trade," Gowin said.
In May, the EU court found that the European Commission had made a mistake considering that Polish retail tax was not allowed public aid.
The Retail Tax Act provided for the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0.8% from the income between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% from the income above PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was due from September 2016.
In September 2016, the EC initiated an infringement of EU law by Poland.
Brussels then argued that the construction of the tax could favour smaller shops, which could be considered public aid.
She then concluded that the denina had been introduced in a way that was illegal.
It also issued a ban on the application of the tax until its analysis by officials in Brussels has been completed.
Poland disagreed with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The EU Court of Justice's May decision opened the way for a reintroduction of the tax but did not end the case.
On 24 July, the Commission lodged an appeal in the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the TEU’s press services informed the PAP that the case is currently in writing, in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.
It is not yet known whether and when the oral procedure is in progress, i.e. hearing the parties and a possible hearing.
It takes a good couple of months or more to appeal a verdict.
"This procedure lasts on average a year," said the PAP source in the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
How Can I Get My Child Baptized?
We're building up a few practical solutions.
Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of a child and his parents.
Often, it is the first opportunity for the whole family to focus around the child, together celebrating his appearance in the world.
Little wonder, then, that the newly baked mother and father want their comfort to look as best that day.
However, before you make your final decision about your child’s clothing, consider whether it will also be convenient.
In shops you can find many machined kits that do not provide the baby with proper comfort.
What, then, should we pay attention to?
The basic criterion for choosing a baptismal garment is the age of a child
Until recently, several weeks of young ones were baptized, dressed in white sets, and inserted into the same barrels or large pillows.
Today, children approaching the sacrament are often older: several months, years, or even more.
It's hard to imagine that so much comfort needs some other baptismal clothing.
So if your child has 3-4 months on the day of baptism, he will likely spend his birthday in a wheelchair or on the hands of his parents or baptized parents.
The best way to do this will be to dress him in comfortable, cottony sleepers or sets.
Although this element of wardrobe is considered a daily dress, it is sufficient to find its sacred variants, for example with a falabank or lace.
For the boy the perfect will be the points with the print of the fly and the shells.
In the case of older children, you can afford to get more fantasy in your dress.
Girl's gonna look beautiful in a straight, tiulous dress.
Many parents of girls look with sadness towards richly decorated, boasting baptismal dresses in addition to coats, belts and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of producers are using artificial, non-respiring materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In looking for a suitable outfit, you will look better at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant machines on cotton linings.
The delicate, tiulous skirts, satin dresses, laces, apps and cute sets will make your little girl look beautiful and comfortable.
Ideal outfit for a small gentleman: cotton suit
Until recently, the boys ’ parents had fashioned suit as a copy of “adulterated” models.
Polyester jackets and pants, rigid collars or helmets often made young elegances very dissatisfied.
Fortunately, today they were lined up by comfortable cotton sets.
Just look at the kits available in Asanti for Kids, i.e. soft, wooden pants, and this blouse decorated in front of the vest.
At the same time, these machines do not stifle the movements of the small world.
Krystyna Pavlovicz published the property statement
Krystyna Pavlovicz made an estate statement at the end of her term.
It turns out that the messenger of PSI has accumulated 110,000 PLN in savings.
Let us remind ourselves that Paul’s announcement was to withdraw from politics.
In the end of the term of office, it has a total of PLN 110,000.
According to the statement made by the messenger, it takes on a monthly pension of PLN 4.7 thousand.
Pavlovicz has an apartment worth PLN 570,000 and slightly smaller which he rents by collecting 880 PLN per month.
The Member also invests in industrial metals, valued investment at PLN 150,000.
Earlier, Jarosław Kaczyński also published the property statement.
Voting on the break during the Conservative Party Conference
The British parliamentarians voted against a three-day break in the House of Gmin's meeting during the annual programme conference of the Conservative Party, which the government asked for.
A total of 289 members voted against – 306.
Normally, the House of Governors does not hold meetings during party conferences, so that Members do not have to resign either from their participation or from Parliament's meetings.
However, the opposition parties considered that, at such a crucial time as are the last weeks before the Great Britain exit from the European Union on 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt the proceedings.
At the request of the Government, 289 Members voted against 306.
Two opposition parties already under the conventions
The lack of consent to a recess may be taken as political revenge on Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (the decision of the Supreme Court on Tuesday was found to be incompatible with the law and to be inexcusable) and for not wanting to apologize for it after the ruling of the judges.
Following this ruling, the House of Governors resumed the session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was the appearance of Johnson and the following heated debate.
Johnson ruled out the opposition to block bruxite and avoid early elections.
"It's time to do the bruxit.
It has to be done to respect the outcome of the referendum.
Brexit has to come so that we can deal with a contract on citizens' priorities, health, cost of living.
Brexit needs to be implemented so that we can unite this country," Johnson said.
The Conference of the Conservative Party is scheduled to begin in Manchester on the coming Sunday and will be held on Wednesday 2 October.
Conferences of the two main opposition groups – Labour Party and Liberal Democrats – have already taken place.
One of the reasons Johnson gave to explain this long suspension of Parliament was just party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
"President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders," the foreign media writes.
The president's spokesman has definitely disputed these reports.
"That's just not true," he wrote on Twitter, "Blaže Spychalski".
The Israeli media, including “Haaretz” and “Jerusalem Post”, referring to “Jewish Insider”, wrote that during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora in the Consulate of the RP in New York, Andrzej Duda claimed that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland was a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the Israeli Foreign Minister of Israel Katz, who stated in February that “Placeans planted anti-Semitism with breast milk.”
Andrzej Duda said he regretted that Israel had not apologized for the humiliating statements of its politicians.
He also mentioned aggression against the Polish Ambassador to Israel, Mark Magierowski.
In May he was attacked by an assailant who shouted, “Polacus, Poles”.
"The quote is not only inaccurate.
It's just not true," he wrote on Twitter.
He stressed that Dude "never said that Israel is responsible for the last anti-Semitic attacks in Poland".
According to the Spychalsky portal, "he invented this."
According to interviewers "JI" during the meeting, there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivor, the Commander's Cross of the Order by Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg would agree with President Dudy's words and say that the Jews of Israel "such as Israel Kac" are responsible for increasing anti-Semitism.
According to Boteach's sources, Mosberg's statement was to be interrupted.
Who is Banas, and what did he do?
The housework rented by the pimps led the journalist to discover negligence in Marian Banas' statements of property.
We're summarizing another affair that has shaken up the ruling camp.
In recent years, TVN’s journalists have revealed that Marian Banas, president of the Supreme Chamber of Control, has not entered the property statement of a 400-meter stone that is located on the Krakow Mountains.
Moreover, his tenant was to drive in the sex business house (and thus rent rooms for hours).
On the other hand, the building has been allegedly a guarantee of repayment since 2016.
Bertold Kittel’s attention to irregularities was drawn to the program “Supervisier”.
The journalist revealed that people associated with the criminal world had rented Banas stone to use it as a place of “erotic encounters”.
Clients were supposed to be men using prostitute services.
Banas' charges were vague and outrageous.
Interestingly, the houseworker rented by the pimps led the journalist to discover negligence in Banas' statements of property.
The house itself was in them, because it was not clear, and the income from its rent was to be devalued.
"The property of Marian Banas and his wife may be worth between PLN 6 million and PLN 8 million.
In fact, spouses can boast of two homes, three apartments, savings[...]", writes Money.pl.
According to the analysis of the portal, Banasia’s own stone was already about PLN 3 million.
The Central Anti-Corruption Office currently controls Marian Banas' property claims for the period 2015-2019.
Banas announced that by the time she was finished, he would suspend his activities at NIK. "I will join you on a holiday free of charge", he assured me.
Opposition calls for clarification.
"We do not hear that the CBA has expanded its investigation or hastened the examination of Marian Banas' claims.
That is why we are forced to hand over the State's authorities and to make a notice of the possibility of committing a crime [...]", said PO-KO Mariusz Witczak.
"If the normal Pole had so grossly underestimated the rental of its properties, it would have already had 10 checks, tax default and criminal procedure," he added.
He came up high, he fell low
Marian Banas is the new president of the Supreme Chamber of Control.
It was appointed on 30 August 2019 for a six-year term.
His candidacy has been notified by the Law and Justice and the votes of the politicians of this party.
Before that, Banas was associated with NIK between 1992 and 2005, acting in this institution as a co-worker of Lech Kaczyński.
During the first governments of the PSI (2005-2008), Banas served as President of the Customs Service and also as Undersecretary of State at the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015, he has again sat at the table of the Head of Customs Service and since 2017 managed the National Treasury Administration.
Banas served three months in the office of Finance Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
Cooler Master puts a graphics card holder on the market
The graphic cards are now able to weigh a lot, and this naturally makes room for the category of products that would be empty on the store shelves a decade ago.
This is the solution – the ElV8 RGB graphic card holder – presented Coleer Master.
The new graphics card handle model is not only a functional solution that allows you to keep the graphics card more secure without relying solely on the PCI-express slot strength.
Cooler Master ELV8 RGB also has an additional task – decorative.
"Positivity": Ignoreing the officer's order will be punished
According to the paper, disregarding the order of conduct issued by a police officer is to be a new type of offence at risk of fines, arrest or restriction of liberty.
Introducing such a change would be wanted by police liaisons.
The idea reached the Commission's meeting on Petitions.
"The matter is serious, because now more than half a million cases are being brought to the Polish courts every year," we read.
The Commission found that a petition, which the Independent Police Association is writing to Members on the amendment of the Code of Offences, has a chance to succeed.
The petitioners propose a new wording for Article 54a of the Code of Offences.
It should read: “Whoever does not obey the request or command of a public official issued within the limits and under the provisions of the law shall be punished by the arrest, fine or restriction of liberty.”
“Par. 3 of this provision speaks of the same punishment for those who do not follow orders, prevent or hinder the performance of their work”, the journal says.
Socjolog Andrzej Kowalski said "The Red Cross" that although he agreed with the main message of the proposal, he was afraid that if implemented, he could be used in political demonstrations.
"In situations of free demonstrations, it would be disadvantageous and instead of mitigating the situation, would exacerbate it," he adds.
Statistics given by the newspaper show that 86% of citizens have been positive about police interventions in 2018 and that 1.5 million interventions in the city are carried out each month.
Buras worries about Europe
I'm the one who's got Topol's writing in his blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
Father Josef Topol was one of the most important post-war dramatists of the Czech Republic, today exchanged in one row with Václav Havel.
Thus, from the beginning, the curse of the talent that this one tries to use was hanging over him.
After eight years, he returned with “a sensitive man. ”
The heroes are Buras and Sonia, along with two sons, who do not make a typical Czech family.
They're generous actors, traveling around Europe.
He's Shakespeare's lover and thief, she's a single-eyed translator who doesn't part with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys was born without sound, and for the second time he stopped in the time of the babies.
But it's not the heroes that are most important in this story.
All constitute only the background to observe a world where there is no longer room for artistic nomads.
It's a world of embittered provinces, old societies, suspicious people and youth resolution.
“A sensitive person” becomes an absurd theatre.
Narration imitates didascalia, and the conversation of heroes creates this world.
Europe is full of concerns about its future, but also constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to Thomas Cook bankruptcy
Although Thomas Cook's British travel agency has fallen, his Belgian subsidiary Neckermann is functioning.
However, the company has problems.
According to VRT, Brussels Airlines announced that they were canceling 105 flights in October due to Thomas Cook’s bankruptcy problems.
Neckermann also fired 75 employees.
All trips with the office, which have been reserved in Belgium, will be cancelled, but temporary officials will be able to receive a refund.
The Gandawa court also announced the collapse of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently around 12,000 Belgians are abroad on trips bought by Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were supposed to leave the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, Empress Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers said that the company is now "full operational" despite the British parent company's announcement of bankruptcy, which caused concern among employees and customers.
The office calmed down that the customers who bought the tours would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook – the oldest and one of the world's largest travel agencies – announced a fall on Sunday night on Monday.
The direct cause of bankruptcy was the collapse on Sunday of the last chance with creditors and potential investors.
In addition to an agreed rescue plan already agreed in August of £900 million, the creditors demanded that the company obtain an additional 200 million as a security for the winter period when the travel agencies usually had lower turnovers.
However, the company’s problems have been growing for several years, with a debt of 1.6 billion pounds.

We're the ones who played very poorly.
This tournament is not over yet for us," said the captain of the Polish sitter Michal Kubiak after defeating Slovenia 1:3 in the semifinals of European championships.
Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for your review
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – this unique offer has been prepared for the arrival of the German Görlitz.
Actions are designed to help combat the progressive decline in the population.
Görlitz is the most prominent city in Germany to the east.
The beautiful pastel old lady attracts 140,000 tourists a year.
However, as The Guardian writes, the city faces considerable problems.
Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.
The city also faces a permanent decline in the population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the western part of the country, which changed to a decline of 25% in the city’s population.
In 2013, it amounted to 54,000 people.
To fight the population, officials came up with an idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 applications have been submitted to the programme.
Two thirds of them were made up by residents of large cities.
The programme was also of interest to people from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom.
"When we applied, we thought the program should convince people to move to Görlitz," one of the project participants said.
"Now we feel that it doesn't matter whether we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.
The city has seven thousand free apartments, and unemployment is three times higher than the average in the whole country.
While the city authorities hope that some will be held permanently, the main objective of the programme is to get the opinion of the participants.
Information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.
"We want to learn more about what people need, and if they decide to move – what their motivation was," Robert Knippschild said.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to lure new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a programme to pay the promising young professionals for life and work in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikyther to Candela in Italy or in the American Tulsia in Oklahoma.
