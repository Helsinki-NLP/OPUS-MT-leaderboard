According to the Tatoeby Directive, it is recommended that members simply add sentences in their native language or translate from a language they understand into their native language. The reason is that it is much easier to compose naturally sounding sentences in their native language. When we write in a language other than their native language, it is very easy to form sentences that sound strange. We ask that you translate the sentence, only when you know for sure what it means.
