28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco shopping centre
A 28-year-old cook, who had recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in a stairwell in a local mall this week.

Luis Galicia said Frank stopped at the hostels first, but he's been having a bit of trouble lately.
"He found an apartment, he met a girl," Luis Galicia said to KGO.
Luis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good soul and a great heart.
His way of communicating with his family has always been to prepare us some dish, prepare us dinner," said Luis Galicia.

In the central bank, countries stated that this amount was a historical maximum, transferred by RIA Novosti.
The previous negative record was set in May this year.

Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years.
The International Group of Biologists has concluded that the longest-lived vertebrate animal is the Greenlandian polar shark, which can live for about 500 years, is transmitted by RT.
Scientists conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the cartilage eye of 28 Greenlandic sharks.
The largest shark with a length of more than five metres may be between 272 and 512 years.
Biologists believe that low metabolism, which leads to slow development, plays an important role in the long term of the shark.
Female Greenlandic sharks reach sexual maturity only by 150 years.
Previously, it was thought that for more than all the vertebrate animals lived a "neighbor" shark, a Greenland whale.
The oldest person known to scientists was just over 210 years of age.

Should we go to the sanatorium if there is no health problem?
Our expert is the chief doctor at Olga Bogosh sanatorium.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of work, should he go to the sanatorium?
Sanitary and curative recreation is needed not only for the treatment but also for the prevention of diseases.
In a sanatorium, a person can check his or her condition and receive advice from a doctor on how to live so that his or her health does not deteriorate.
Such recommendations will not be unnecessary to anyone.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal of the body, it's not worth waving away from.
Sustained stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And the stress is about 90 percent of the people coming.
He is most vulnerable to people from large cities aged 45 to 55.
So it's best not to complicate the situation and give yourself time to rest.
Studies show that 98 per cent of people are reducing their biological age during their stay in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer a comfortable rest for the whole family.
So if you want to take a break with the kids, you won't have to break up with them.
Children, even the smallest, have health programmes that include both diagnostic services, paediatric counselling, analysis and treatment.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children's basins), inhalations, special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, curative physiology.
The course of procedures is determined by the physician, taking into account individual indications and characteristics of the growing organism.
In addition, in sanatoriums, there is usually a children ' s club with animators, where children can attend play classes, different master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for guests with infants, provide the necessary conditions and provide the services of an experienced nanny.
The soft winter, long summer, and the plenty of sunny days of the year (over 300) create good conditions for round-the-clock recreation on the resorts of the Caucasus Mineral Water.
And then the body needs rest in the summer.
So you don't have to worry about the weather behind the window, especially since most of the procedures are in place and are not dependent on the season.
Generally, sanatorium-curricular treatment is desirable to be administered twice a year, especially for adults.
Main fiche of the Caucasus Mineral Water region, of course, healing mineral sources: Slavyanovski, Smirnovsky, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their water has unique properties and affects different systems of the body.
Water differs by temperature, amount of salt, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor chooses water depending on the patient's self-esteem.
Narzan, for example, has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating effects, restores the functions of the gastric tract and the metabolism of substances.
Essentuki-4 affects the gastric tract, lowers the level of sugar.
The new Essentuki has anti-inflammatory, galloping and urinating effects.
The same is true of the water "Slavianovska".
When water is appointed, the physician must take into account the condition of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it picks out less salty water, because salts contain fluid, which causes pressure to rise.
The intake of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be taken at a certain time, at the right amount and at a specific temperature.
Various cosmetic procedures for the person and body are now available in the sanatoriums.
What types of health care based on the natural characteristics of the Northern Caucasus can be obtained from the resorts of the region?
Near Pettigorsk, for example, is the salty Lake Tambukan, which is an iron mud that is useful for the joints, the vertebral, the internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammatory, dissipating, immunomodulating effect.
These are healthful walks on individually designed routes.
They are particularly popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge resort park (second in size in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is close to the Narzan mineral source.
There you can also take baths of wine, pearly, yolknomous, selenium, halphein lacrenic depending on what your doctor will appoint.
Let's extend the fertility.
What can you do to make the harvest go by the end of the season?
Tells Julia Belopuhova, an agronomist, and a daughter - in - law.
It's time for the high-end tomatoes to make a haircut: to remove new pastures, to cut the macaws, to remove all the leaves to the last bone with fruits and flowers with small bandages - they can't see.
All tomatoes, irrespective of the “constitution”, as well as peppers and baclans, are fed by the golden superphosphate extract, processed by biopreparates (The Viewer is used to accelerate the supply and growth of the fruit, the Photosporin-M, Fitolavin, Gamair, the Bactofite is fed by the disease, the Immunocytophyte is used to enhance immunity, the Bitoxibacyllin, Lepidocid, the Fitowerm, if there are pests).
Chemical products at the end of the summer should be used only copper dome, colloid cheese and green soap.
We're doing the last field of plants.
Long-wired cucumbers in the heat allow the bottom, naked part of the stalk (25-40 cm) to lie on the ground, pour hot water and solution of the Cyccon, and put a stem of 5-7 cm compost on the ground.
It is also easy to extend the plantation: cut the old leaves, pour hot water and a solution for a complex fertilizer, and put the fertile soil under the bush.
For protection from the night’s colds, set up a narrow arc with curvature material over it.
Keep the plants open during the day, and close the sun after sunset.
Signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia's withdrawal from the longest recession in the last 20 years.
According to Bloomberg analysts, GDP has shown positive momentum - GDP declined by 0.8 per cent in the second quarter of GDP in annual terms.
This figure has been minimal since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data from Rosstat, the decline in the Russian economy in the second quarter slowed to 0.6 per cent.
The Central Bank and the Micro-Development have also recently declared stabilization.
The front is slow growth.
According to CBI experts, the recession in the Russian economy remained in the past.
“Indication of Russian GDP suggests that recession remains behind and the economy is slowly growing ahead” says the Bank of Russia bulletin “What Trends Say”.
A modular GDP estimate for the current quarter of the regulator increased to 0.4 per cent, an estimate of 0.5 per cent per fourth quarter.
According to the representative of Micronesia, during the second quarter of the GDP decline, the GDP stood in the second quarter, accounting for 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter, the seasonally cleared GDP decline was 0.2 per cent to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter the decline stopped: in April it was 0.2 per cent and in May and June the change in GDP was between 0 and 0.15", quoted RIA 'New's representative.
The slowdown in the fall of the Russian economy over the last five quarters shows that “the bottom has passed”.
Among other markers indicating signs of national economic recovery, Bloomberg calls for increased demand for electricity and rail transport, and business recovery.
When an adjustment is made for the year to be high, it is clear that the dynamics plus 1 per cent of electricity consumption can be half due to the additional working day.
Add a lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the increase in freight transport, but it is difficult to obtain accurate data, and a plus-one per cent half-year volume can also be explained by seasonality”, explains Kirill Jakovenko of ALOR BROOKER.
In fact, there are other more obvious signs of stabilizing the Russian economy.
For example, lowering price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent compared with 15.6 per cent last month.
Moreover, in the past two weeks, Rosstat has been deflating.
Prices in Russia dropped for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the rouble course, which, although showing strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, after August the year began, it has been strengthened by 12 per cent.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, which must be followed by indicators from the real economy", said Jakovenko.
In addition, industrial production has increased since April.
In June, the rate rose by 1.7 per cent.
The rate of downturn in foreign trade is slowed from -32.8 per cent in January 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May.
The situation in the labour market is also positive, where unemployment has declined to 5.4 per cent.
It was only below in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the well-being of the labour market, the question of the real income available to the population has left a wish for a better one.
In annual terms, the rate is reduced by 4.8 per cent.
This may hamper economic recovery, as household expenditure contributes little to GDP.
Generally, their share in the economy exceeds 50 per cent.
In addition to low consumer activity, the Bank of Russia has also been described as a risk to economic growth.
The regulator retains a 10.5 per cent rate, which has no better impact on the real sector.
The negative factor is also the insufficient level of investment, which hampers the development of industrial capacity.
But in general, it can be assumed that by the end of the year, the pace of the fall in the economy of the Russian Federation will slow to -0.5 per cent against -3.7 per cent in 2015,” says Forex Club analyst Irina Rogova.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and well spent in winter sports at the Sochi Olympics, has not yet developed so much in summer sports.
If the Olympic Games in Rio are in favour of Russia and the former foreigners speak, in most cases they are the births of former Soviet republics.
In Rio, however, we can observe the reverse process - a sufficient number of Russians are under the flag of other States.
In each case, the history of the change of nationality differs.
Some parents were taken to another country when they were young, leaving no choice.
Someone didn't stand the competition for a place in the Russian assembly.
And someone thought that abroad would create the best conditions for development in sport.
AIF.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian nationality.
A 27-year-old girl in the German passport says her name's Lisa Ryjih.
But, of course, Elizabeth had been before.
She was born in 1988 in the town of Omsk.
Just four years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lisa's parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to go up her older sister's feet to do a light athletic thing.
Like my sister, Lisa picked a pair of jumps with a six.
Staying in Russia, I don't think you could lift Elena Isinbaev from the throne.
Unfortunately, at the Rio Olympics, Liza will be our only countryman, even if she is an ex, in the Six Jumping Sector.
Its best achievements in this form of sport are the 2010 bronze champion of Europe and the silver of the continental championship in 2016, which it won again in the absence of Elena Isinbaeva.
29-year-old Elena Pirogzkova was born in Novokusznick in 1986.
Her parents are religious propagandists of evangelistism.
Mostly because of their faith, they left for the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, there were eight other children in the family.
They all lived in a small town in the state of Massachusetts, Greenfield.
Lena started to get involved in the fight at school.
With good results, she moved to Colorado Springs, where another former Russianman, Vladislav Izbojnikov, continued her studies at the U.S. Center for Combating Training.
Elena lost her first fight at the 2012 Olympics in London.
But at the peace championship that same year, victory.
Before that, she had succeeded in winning silver at the 2010 world championship.
After that, the 2013 bronze and the 2014 silver.
A 26-year-old Mary was born in Jaroslavla, where she first met the synchronized swim.
But to say that she was raised by our trainers in Russia would be wrong.
Soon, the girl’s family decided to emigrate to the United States and move to Colorado.
There, Maria continued her studies.
Soon she was part of the U.S. Assembly, and she showed great results in the Pan American Games.
It is understandable that, at a serious international level, Russian synchronists cannot compete, but for America its indicators are ceilings.
A new name, which sounds strange in Russian, Kristina Shaldibina was granted at the age of 11 when her parents decided to continue to train the girl in the art gymnastics of the ocean.
Before that moment, the girl had been involved in a favorite sport in Jaroslav.
As she emigrated to the United States, she quickly entered the country’s youth collection and later broke into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
For her first position on the world scene, of course, she did not have to fight, but for the United States, she has made a real breakthrough -- brought a star band to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another of our former artists is Jan Berezko-Marggrander, who is in favour of a group of Germans.
She was born in Toletta.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had a better chance of getting into the national assembly.
Soon she was presenting her country at the 2012 Olympics in London.
True, she was able to take only 17 places that were not enough to get into the final competitions in her personal first place.
But two years before that, she was able to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Games as a boy.
Another gymnast, only this time, Irina Sazonova.
If the emigration of the athletes mentioned earlier can be described as standard, the choice of the Irina family is very unusual, Iceland.
Ira is a graduate of the Volgograd Sports School.
Of course, in Iceland, she has become the country's champion.
True, the training of Ira in Russia still comes to the home country to avoid losing his mastery.
In Rio, she did not speak as well as she would like.
The best place is 40 in a personal room.
There is very little information on the float of Maria Ugolkova in the Russian information area.
Mary has lived and trained in Switzerland for a very long time.
For a long time, however, it has been under the Russian flag, showing good results - even the country's record has been 200 metres away by batterflies.
In 2015, she obtained Swiss citizenship and began acting under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance is 14 seats in a 4×100 integrated relay.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfandinggo project that enabled her to collect some 6,000 francs that allowed her to pay for her Olympic preparations.
Adam Batirov, a 31-year-old free-style fighter, spent almost all his career under the Russian flag.
During that time, Hasavurt's birthday boy managed to become a three-time champion of European champions, the champion of Russia, the master of sport of the international class.
When he stopped attending our national assembly, it was time to consider changing citizenship.
For a few years, a talented fighter disappeared from the sports field.
The triumphal return took place at the 2016 Asian Cup - Batirov already represented Bahrain, for which he won the gold medal and got a trip to the Rio Olympics.
Another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, is even less known in the country than even the Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkov.
The point is his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very small.
That's where Michael started to do sports gymnastics.
He had not made much progress at the international level.
In Rio, his best result was 40 seats in the qualifications for parallel brussels.
But for New Zealand, even getting into the Olympics in gymnasts is a breakthrough.
When Nasté, born in Moscow in 1985, was only nine years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her work in synchronous navigation, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championship in Berlin, a girl took 6th place in the synchronous navigation.
In a duet with Eugenius Tetelbaum Anastasia, eighth place.
She was five in her solo program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Croyter is in favour of Israel.
When the boy was only six years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, Dmitry became the country's champion in 17 years.
That same year, he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Croyter also wins the gold of the Youth Olympics in Singapore.
In addition to the leaps to the height, Dmitry takes the jumps into length and the three-way jumps.
31-year-old Albert is another member of Hasavurt, who, after long speeches for Russia, decided to change his athletic citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which will be represented in Rio.
In Russia, however, he was in favour of the School of Higher Sports at Krasnoyarsk, and in 2011 he even became the champion of the country.
The 28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the U.S.S.S.S.S.A. volleyball player, Jaroslav Antonov.
Just a year before Jaroslav’s son was born, he was recognized as the world’s best volleyball player.
Soon he decided to continue his career in Italy.
The same family stayed for the rest of the day.
In 2015, he became the national team's bronze champion of Europe in the territory of his new homeland.
Hadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and was brought together with his family in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, parents decided to emigrate.
Norway was originally targeted, but it was not possible for the northern country to go to France, Nice.
There, Zilimhan continued to study free fighting.
Soon he won the championship of peace among the juniors and later qualified for the Olympic Games as well.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the wrestling tournament.
And again a free fight, and a former Russian.
This time we're going to talk about the North Ossetian birth which emigrated to Spain, Timuraz Frieva.
At the end of December 2012, he was assigned Spanish nationality and is now in favour of the country ' s team.
Before that, indeed, a 30-year-old sportsman was able to make a very high score in Russia.
He was a bronze-stamped champion of the country in 2007 and 2008.
The Constitution from non-falls to the assembly, Timuraz decided to change sports nationality.
The last on our list is a Chechen boxer born in 1995 in the capital city of Dagestan Mahackal, Arthur Bierslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, the parents took the family across Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur started boxing on the advice of his older brother.
Since then, Arthur has been the champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 he became the champion of peace among young people.
In 2015, Bijerslanov won the gold of the Pan American Games, the first for his new home country since 1975.

Married, has a son.
Why are the kids talking in schools?
According to Governor V. Kondratiev, “it is necessary to train, not by action and parades, but by system.”
They must grow up and realize from at least 7 years of age that they are Kazakhs and education must be spoken.
But as far as I can tell, this work is being done formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Kazakh classes are able to absorb everything positive that has been accumulated before, at a qualitatively new level, I will be happy.
If all the swelling is not known, a new idea will turn into cheap populism.
CFCs continue to be one of the most criminal sectors in the country ' s economy.
There is an integrator for funds allocated to the public domain from budgets at different levels.
According to the Office of the Attorney-General, excessive tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the area of HQs.
As a result, more than 170 million rubs were remunerated by the region ' s consumers.
In the days and in the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of the Krasnodar Region, the facts revealed that unnecessary costs were included in the tariffs.
The cost of the IW-Consulting (cold water) was $4 million for the rental of cars at a higher price than the market price.
And there's a mass of these in the country.
The people pay the last money for the “communal” and pay the correct amount, according to the data from the Ministry of the Russian Federation, the average collection of payments from the population is 94 per cent.
He is accused immediately of several articles of the Penal Code: destruction, legalization of proceeds of crime, abuse of authority, etc.
On the basis of the investigation, as the head of the fund that was in the process of repairing urban facilities, Makarov had concluded contracts with the entrepreneurs, it had not actually been carried out but had been paid for.
Businessmen just gave him back most of the money.
As the master of the OC, Makarov collected money from the population, but he did not pay the service providers and spend it on his own.
As a result, the budget and housing are damaged by millions of rubles.
Makarova's machinations scheme, ears typical of Russia.
There was a wave of arrests and detentions by the leaders of the KPC, who took over the citizens ' money.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kohan continues, by the way, as was the former mountain official, who was accused of being machinated by 91.7 million rubles.
According to the investigation, it established 6 company managers in Elizovo Kamchatska in 2012-2013 and established 3 limited-liability societies.
One of them was contracted by the OPC, the other two played the role of money centres, i.e. money from the population.
However, A. Kohan did not list the funds, but he spent the money on himself, my beloved.
It's quite difficult to face up in the area of HCS.
Cases don't start up, they're getting tight.
And “helps” in this extremely complicated housing legislation, according to Svetlan Razrotnev, executive director of NP HKH Control.
We can't make a single law, like we're making a new one, which should make the previous one work.
Specialists, including judges, are also few on CFC issues.
Lawyers themselves admit that very little attention has been paid to housing law in prisons.
Refusals to initiate criminal proceedings are also referred to in the Office of the Public Prosecutor's Office by the wolves in the course of the investigations.
Of the production in 2015, 3.5 thousand crimes were sent to the court.
The remaining investigation was prolonged and each fifth was suspended in the absence of an accused person.
Insecures in law enforcement are often attributed to gaps in existing legislation.
There is a law, but the authorities are slow to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of counterfeiting - only 60 criminal cases were initiated.
In five months of the current year, the number has only increased slightly - 99.
What is the falsification of the residence assembly protocol?
This means that home management shifts, financial and other issues go hand in hand with owners.
And that also means that the housing and utilities market cannot be tested by normal companies who want to work honestly, rather than “do” the population.
It turns out the tenants in the minus, small and medium-sized business, too.
First of all, by eradicating corruption as such in all States, Anton Jarkov, a member of the Gosdum Property Committee, is confident.
This work is being actively pursued.
It is not just a one-stop-shop action; it is a targeted course to combat corruption.
Of course, not all regions have such a sad situation.
In particular, the capital does not smell scandals.
Why does Moscow have no such scandals in the area of HQs as in many other regions?
Because the capital government has shown its iron will and order, Anatoly the Elections, a member of the Security and Anti-Corruption Committee, said.
I refer to both the human resources issue and legislative amendments and legal education.
Management companies were closely supervised, and they all went through licensing.
Complaints by citizens are promptly resolved in public space (and the treatment of residents and the response measures are placed on the Moscow Government portal).
Not only do many pay monthly receipts but they carefully monitor what is written there as a home.
Public awareness of the rights of owners and obligations of resource providers and managers is very high.
Plus Moscow is testing the validity of housing and utilities tariffs, as a large part of the budget goes to subsidies and benefits for many categories of the population.
Probably all of this together and explains the calm situation in Moscow.
Is it true that everything is in the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe a free man should change his job?
Turkish gambit.
Can Erdogan abandon his friendship with the EU and the United States?
The President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, introduced an ultimatum in the United States, suggesting that a choice should be made between Turkey and Fethullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup.
He spoke to his supporters in Ankara about this.
Erdogan called on the Americans to abandon the support of the “terrorist organization of fethullachists”.
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States calls for a change of attitude.
Experts believe that the rift between Turkey and the West is growing and may lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
"Early or late America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO ("Terrorist Organization of Fathullachists").
It is either the organisation of the FETO coups or a democratic Turkey.
It must make that choice," the Anatolia Agency quotes Erdogon as saying on Wednesday evening in Ankara.
The President of Turkey once again, but has already urged the United States to comply with his demand for the first time since the rebellion.
Recall that on the night of 16 July in Turkey, high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army attempted to overthrow the legitimate authority of the country, as well as the attempt on the life of the head of State.
However, after Recep Erdogan appealed to the population, the rebellion was suppressed, and his organizers and participants were arrested.
A total of 8,000 people were suspected of being teachers and scientists, in addition to the military.
According to Recep Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah Gulen, a resident of Pennsylvania, U.S.A.
Ergogan's supporters also allowed the Americans to be involved in the coup.
The Panel finds that the Panel finds that the Panel finds that the Panel finds that the Panel finds that the Panel finds that the Panel finds that the Panel finds that the Panel finds that the Panel finds that the Panel finds that the Panel finds that the Panel finds that the Panel finds that the Panel finds that the Panel finds that the Panel finds that the Panel finds that the Panel finds that the Panel finds that the Panel finds that the Panel considers that the Panel finds that the
The last statement by the representatives of Mr. Gossep was made at the time of his visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey - he insists on his own and also demands on other Western partners.
“Ankara will cease to fulfil its obligations under a migration agreement with the European Union unless Brussels calls for the lifting of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens”, said Minister Omer Celik of Turkey on 9 August.
He said that Ankara's amendment of the anti-terrorism law, as required by the EU, would jeopardize Europe's own security.
It should be noted that on 1 August, Deputy Chancellor of Germany, Zigmar Gabriele, demanded Turkey to stop blackmailing the European Union with promises to open the border for migrants in order to facilitate the visa regime with the EU.
His remarks were in response to the relevant statement by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Mevlut Chavushoglu.
Another provocative statement by Chavushoglu was made on the past Wednesday, allowing Turkey to withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not exclude that the country would consider withdrawing from the alliance if it did not meet the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence field is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign nations in the defence field - they import missiles," Chaushoglu was interviewed by Anadolu.
He said that Turkey now needed to establish its own defence system on the basis of its technologies, as well as to cooperate with other countries.
“Turkishly, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have begun to look for others”, said the Minister.
The experts believe that all of this reflects Turkey ' s serious differences with the West and the country ' s reorientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise, Evgeny Minchenko, believes that Recep Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot go to a severe confrontation with the West.
He has a lot of ties to the West and in terms of business and military (Turkey is a NATO member), so I think Erdogan will try to balance with the West.
While, of course, the Americans would be more comfortable to see in this post a fully obedient person," explained the expert.
He said it would be possible that after statements by the Turkish leader (not paying compensation to the EU, requiring visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of Guulen from the United States) he would be pressured.
"Rejep Erdogan will be confronted with a deterioration of relations both with America and with the European Union, which they will push on the humanitarian issue, on the dictatorial methods of governance of the country and so on," he said.
The Head of the Political Information Centre, Alexei Muhin, allows the President of Turkey to change his views on Russia as soon as it benefits him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took a very tough stand against Russia and in every way sought favor in the West.
In very little time, the situation changed to the opposite.
Guarantee that after a while the President of Turkey again does not change his priorities is not possible.
I think Erdogan entered a period of man-made diplomacy.
When he turns between the two poles, West and Russia, he will try to gain the greatest benefit for himself," he says, "Muhin.
In his view, the main task for the President of Turkey today is to maintain political power in the country, which requires Russia and its partnership with Vladimir Putin to stop the US from supporting Guulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the United States to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, consensus with Turkey will be reached”, said the expert.
Another view is taken by the Head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East, Anna Glaszov.
Turkey's relations with both the EU and the United States are rather tense, and this is primarily due to the internal policy pursued by Erdogan himself.
I think that this crisis will be exacerbated, and in the face of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to re-load policies both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
Not by chance, the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, state that they are ready to change their position on a number of Syria issues, resolve relations with Israel, engage in active political interaction with Iran," explained AIF.ru Glaszov, which would allow Erdogon to normalize relations with Egypt as the next step.
She said that the policy currently being pursued by Erdogan was a return to the foreign policy concept that Turkey had followed before the Arab revolution.
"It was at that time that Turkey began to develop very actively its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region in its "zero problems with its neighbours" positions.
Very good visits by the President of Turkey to Russia and the countries of Africa have now been made.
Therefore, this vector of foreign policy will develop and contribute to strengthening the positions of Turkey on both regional and international levels," said the expert.
He said that returning Turkey to former relations with the EU would be extremely difficult, but now the question was whether the EU would be in strict response to Turkey, which could open the borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
The strike of junior doctors: Calls for new collective protests
The assistant doctors asked the union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over a new employment contract.
The Committee of Associate Physicians (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is going to ask its full council to support more collective protests since early September.
The JDC said that ministers could not answer questions about the labour contract.
Junior medical doctors and medical students voted in July to cancel a contract of employment agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members who took part in the secret ballot.
In a letter to the members issued on Twitter Thursday evening, President Ellen McCort said that the Government had continued to “silently remain silent” about the problems that she had said had led to the rejection of the labour contract.
She said, "In taking into account the prevailing situation, the head of the JDC voted in favour of rejecting the proposed new employment contract in full volume and called for formal renegotiations on all your issues."
In response to the Government's silence, the head of the JDC today made a formal request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme for the expansion of collective protests, beginning in early September.
The dispute has led young doctors to participate in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
Dr. Joan Malavana, the leader of the junior doctors, resigned after a vote to cancel the agreed terms of the employment contract, which BMA recommended.
He told members of BMA that the deal was a good one, which should be taken during the meetings in advance of the vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, the Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the employment contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: Alliance of Bad?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague in the paved palace in St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
It was a handshake, yeah.
But Mr. Putin's smile looked tense, and he hardly had heat out even by his own restrained standards.
In contrast, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly referred to his “good friend” Mr. Putin, five times, according to one report.
I lost my bill.
He also promised that his relationship with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described the actions of Mr. Erdogon as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm meant the opposite.
But the lingering chill that Mr. Putin gave us showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first to be mentioned in the opening comments: Turkey knocked down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at this point was distasteful.
Mr. Putin was struck by an angry tyranny, accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow in the back.
The insult was even more severe, based on the alleged friend.
Renewing real trust would be difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
Over the months, the state-controlled media have carried out a stunning, total attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks should be found guilty of everything.
The most serious allegations were from senior officials that Mr. Erdgan's own family had been subjected to illegal oil trade from Syrian zones controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied it.
But there was an official signal in St. Petersburg, which was the time to move on.
After all, this meeting occurred only because Mr. Putin received an apology he demanded from President Ergogan.
Russia could have claimed a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the advantage of declaring the truce is clear.
First of all, Erdogon needs all the friends he can get after he was almost knocked off his post last month while attempting a coup.
His repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey had clearly shocked him, too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have severely impacted — especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The figure fell sharply by almost 90%.
With regard to Russia, the tour operators and charter companies here will, of course, feel a relief when the flights finally resume.
They're putting a peak at the end of the Mediterranean season.
Even this week, public television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products were allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," said the report in the newspaper Vedomosty.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is evil in the West because she considers it a weak response to an attempted coup.
Add to this her prolonged dissatisfaction with the tumbling pace of EU accession and Mr Putin’s step — which seeks to enjoy the coolness and gradually destroy Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for the support of elected authorities after an attempt to overthrow the State.
Keep in mind, this is a tribute to Moscow, which has its own deeply entrenched fear of changing the regime.
So, the summit in this shining palace on the seashore allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described to me as "the alliance of the bad": two countries, who feel rejected and humiliated in the West, join forces.
Yet, despite the public demonstration of reconciliation, these two still differ significantly.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite parties.
It may speak for itself that after nearly three hours of initial negotiations, while the two presidents gave a press conference, they did not even touch on the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find common language in Syria.
But after months of open hostility — and taking into account the possibility of a complete catastrophe when a member of NATO knocked down a Russian jet fighter -- it is better that two leaders speak at least once again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland
Brand RBS should be taken to the role of the Bank Office, according to the Executive Director of the Bank.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the global ambitions of the bank.
The Bank had retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued.
During this period, brand strategies used RBS to protect other consumer credit brands.
He supported millions of pounds of sponsorship aid to international sport, from Cuba to the Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But it was now decided that it was right to allow more national brands to take the lead.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already being used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for banking services for individuals who will get more influence — Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan gave an interview during a tour of clients and staff in Invernessshire.
He said to BBC Scotland, "Brand RBS will eventually be our investment brand and our staff, because we are now more of a brand bank."
Since the bank itself has become a global brand, RBS has become a global brand.
I am now saying that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in its population groups, and our staff will work with clients under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsoring support for the Six Nations Cup, and it is increasing the profile of various brands in sponsoring sport.
"This is the right time for us to move the brand bank, because on the basis of (we asked ourselves) how are we focused on improving the bank for customers?" said the executive director.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said we were going to be a great bank for customers and close all those brands.
But with the work we've done focusing on the needs of clients, not on our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can get those brandies back, so I think it's a good time.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with a victory in Newmarket on the  enterprist.
The kids spray champagne after a double in Newmarquet leads him to 3,000 wins.
Jockey Frankie Dettori won his 3000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this remarkable note with his second night winner on his home track, on the Pristice, trained by John Hosden.
A 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this outstanding score in smooth jumps.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Iddeary and Willy Carson.
The three-time detori jockey champion, who had won Ghayyar before, said, "That's something special."
I'm very excited because my family's here too.
I'm really glad it happened in Newmarquet because this is where I moved here 30 years ago.
It's not a big secular event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's usually Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm out of business and very unattractive.
Children receive applause when they have predisposition after victory
Two jockeys have reached such a point in jumping with obstacles: Richard Johnson's jockey champion, who retired 20-time Ser Anthony McCoy, who had over 4,300 winning for a record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 career victors
Frankie is one of the best jockeys in the modern era, and it is not surprising that he has achieved this mark, which so few have reached before him.
It's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical wand that distinguishes it from the others in the weight room.
He was an excellent representative for jumping, his enthusiasm and charisma, and attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Espos, he'd have brought in 6,000 winners if he weren't just a weekend jockey and a big jumper!
And seriously, Frankie's been bringing the winners to the UK for most 30 years, which is great to see.
He's an energetic character, which is good for British jumps, but more than that, he's an amazing jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this remarkable landmark with a speeding leap from the horse
From speedy finishes to fast jumps, Frankie Dettori is a symbol of British smooth leaps for two decades.
It was taking off and falling.
The number of winners of the big jumps, including his famous "Great Seven" in Askot in 1996, but he also survived the plane crash and was disqualified for doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after six months of disqualification, but he showed tremendous willpower to challenge skeptics and return to form.
And he may not have finished for some time — Detectives earlier said that he would like to continue to participate in competitions, at least until the age of 50.
Putin fires the head of the administration of Sergei Ivanova
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired his head of administration, Sergei Ivanova.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted circle for many years.
This 63-year-old was now appointed as the representative of environment and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin stated that Putin “decided to free Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian administration of the President” but did not say why.
Mr. Ivanova's deputy since 2012, Anton Wyno, has been his successor.
Mr. Wyno, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia, Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (IGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he was the head of the minutes of the President and the Government apparatus, reporting the Kremlin website (in Russian).
At the time of his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your work as Head of State in drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are being followed.
Putin informed one Russian television channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked for his release from office and recommended that Wyno replace him.
Do smiles convince you?
It's a move that puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest supporters and, like him, has served in the Soviet Security Service, the KGB.
As Head of Administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who showed on State television, both men stated that the head of administration had resigned on his own request.
But despite the smiles on the camera, few people have been persuaded here — especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So, are these the unforeseen consequences of some power struggle?
As long as no one knows.
But the official statement — that a person who had once been promoted as a potential president suddenly wanted to govern Russian environmental policy — was met with great skepticism.
In Putin's comments quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said: “It is true that in early 2012 I asked you to trust me with this very difficult post, even for four years.
Well, I think I've been president of the President's administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He had previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former member of the KGB State Security Service, as was Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, since Putin's third term would be contrary to the Constitution.
However, this post was taken by another close supporter, Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before returning to the presidency three and a half years later.
Star of "Thinking Like a Criminal" Thomas Gibson fired after a fight with a producer.
Gibson was a hitter at a show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before his removal was announced.
There were creative differences in imagery and differences of opinion.
I regret that this happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how Gibson's character will be removed from the show, which is being followed by a team of FBI agents, is expected to be received later, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who had played a major role in the sito Darma and Greg, was on the show since season one in 2005.
"I love "Think like a criminal" and have invested my heart and soul in it for the past twelve years," Gibson said in his statement issued on Friday.
I hoped to be there until the end, but now it will be impossible.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our great team, and, most importantly, the best fans the show could ever dream of.
The show is scheduled to return with its twelfth season on 28 September.
Mysterious: Fish landed in the garden of Banff
A man from Banff sought help to identify the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could have been sandstones left behind by water smothering.
Bane, who lives 500 metres away from the sea, recorded this scene in Periscope in the hope that someone could shed light on the appearance of two dozen fishes.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge is now connected to Fife
The $1.35 billion project is now to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers joined the North Spring and Queensferry Crossing — which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of the four joints between the “beliefs of the canvas” that are now approaching completion near all three saws of the bridge.
The Fif Bridge Section is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
There were 10,000 tons of concrete and 46 tons of bridge.
The $1.35 billion project is now to be completed by May 2017.
The Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from land to bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of engineering's truly epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete and have become used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the closure of the connection between the ballast and the bridge was a virtual operation using extremely accurate assembly tolerances.
A total of 79 per cent of the entire bridge canvas is now on site, and for the last section of the canvas concrete coatings are poured into Russia today, which means that all the canvas is ready to rise on the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: "The first bending on each bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this amazing project, this jointing is the most modern building art.
Following the installation of the last section of the road surface and its connection with the expanding north sawdust, we were left to close the remaining view on the north side or on the coast.
This was done by pulling a north approach of 700 millimeters south.
It was a large-scale and yet very sophisticated operation.
It is large because the 222 metre image weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be raised at an angle of about 3 per cent.
Fine because the team’s allowances were only a few millimetres in each direction.
Fortunately, all of this went very well.
Rescue in Moelfr Bay: Three men lucky to stay alive.
Three men got lucky to stay alive after they got thrown off a fishing boat in England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised alarm at 13:20 on British summer time on Friday after the team saw an incident unfolding in Moelfr Bay.
Three men tried hard to get to a safe place, while their ship continued to move on.
"We saw their ship circled next to them and assumed the worst," said Moelfre Vince Jones, the driver's lifeboat.
" Fortunately, by the time we got down to the water, the strong wind had taken it away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing vessel, and a third man, 60 years old, was found helpless and stuck in a buoy without a life jacket.
All of them were taken aboard the coast rescue boat and taken to the rescue station.
Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had an emergency unlocker, but somehow it got away from the man driving the boat when it crashed.
Someone's been saving these guys today.
Pokémon Go, worthy of hunting for health and happiness
It's exciting to see the world change.
That adolescents and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time watching screens, has been a complaint to many in the past decade.
Pokemon Go takes people off the couch and engages them in some physical activity.
Time in the screen was initially limited to TV, then video games, and recently smartphones.
It is so good to see that technology and street activity are not mutually exclusive.
I am, of course, referring to the full involvement of Pokémon Go, an application based on the characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (after which a series of cartoons, playing cards and other responses were produced).
Like many other pop-cultural events, it all lost its relevance a few times before this new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Launching in other countries at the time was delayed due to the massive response that overloaded the servers.
In the days considered, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder had and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In two words, the smartphone players go looking for the Pokemons that are being tracked on GPS and, being discovered, they can be photographed (through the box on your phone) or caught.
The generation who played the game, when younger, joined in the full - time pursuit of divination.
In the United States, the game has resulted in a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the “ordinary” person every day.
A chart, an app for Apple Watch, which monitors 35,000 users, recently reported to Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people monitored by them, who performed 30 minutes daily, jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary leveling data.
Many health campaigns that convince people to "find 30 minutes", "get up from the couch" and "be active every day", have not responded because most health messages are boring and are spoken by people who look unhappy.
Nevertheless, the importance of physical exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who practice regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps to correct weight, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it pushes people out into the street to do what they love.
Thus, there are three basic health bases: traffic, fresh air, sunlight, and joy.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As usual, there are boring boredoms looking for something to complain about.
And, yes, someone might bump into the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even though the smartphone apps, such as Fitbit, could still monitor our physical activity, they gave us no reason to do what this game does.
The news will arrive and use will weaken over time.
However, the success of Pokemon will result in more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to be more active, in good form and healthy.

Simon Byles wins gold of absolute primacy in female gymnast
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the sumatoch.
Simon Byles is irresistible for all of this.
Dynamic on the support jump.
Unnecessary.
It's stunning on the floor.
It's amazing everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic Championship.
A 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of an absolute championship on Thursday, putting a gap between herself and the rest of the world at a convincing demonstration under close Olympic attention.
Its overall score of 62.198 was sufficiently removed from the silver medalist and comrade of the "Final Five" Eli Reisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafafina.
Byles from the United States speaks on a gymnast during the final of the women's individual absolute championship in artistic gymnastics for 2016 at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Byles became the fourth consecutive American woman to win the title of the championship of absolute primacy and fifth at all, retaining her reputation as the best of her generation and possibly at any time.
She was angry when she was shown the final score and her long journey to this point was over.
This achievement puts her in the same league as rare aircraft, such as Michael Felps, who raised their sport to new heights:
Byles spent the last three years dominating his sport by winning 15 medals of the world champion, including 10 gold ones, with such dazzling programs in their mixture of work and accuracy that the 1984 Olympic Championship Mary Lou Retton called her the "greatest gymnast I have ever seen".
One final test was waiting in Brazil, the competition not so much between Bailes and the others in this area, but rather between her and the load of excessive expectations.
Anything less than going back to your family's home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be viewed as an unwarranted expectation.
Simon Byles from the United States, left, and Eli Reisman hug after winning gold and silver in the final of the women's individual absolute championship in the arts at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Byles earned her first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for a farewell party retired coordinator of the National Assembly of Martha Carole.
While Byles insisted that she had never looked to the future during her long journey to the top, that was not the case.
Part of her free exercise program — which includes her firm passage — is set to Latin American music, which would come directly as a house on the street just outside the Olympic Arena Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl adopted by her grandfather and grandmother by starting to walk with her child and by opening up to coach Amy Burman during her visit to the gym where Burman was a coach became a force.
She has not lost a single competition for absolute championships since the summer of 2013 — a lane that should continue for as long as Byles wants to.
Although Mustafa had received a small advantage through two spins, it was a mirage.
The gymnast and free exercise — where Byles defends the title of the world champion — is ambushed.
She moved forward again from 15,433 on the log and ended from 15,933 on the floor.
Reisman gently embraced her while they were waiting for the final account — pure formality — and tears appeared around a brilliant red with a white and blue hood for the eyes of Byles, when the idea she had once written in a cut-off album was realized.
Riceman's performance was a small revenge four years ago, when she was in third place, but she lost the bronze of Mustafa in the bank.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of a team that Americans call "the grandmother" was far ahead.
She sent out a crowd kiss after her free exercise covered by a return, which sometimes seemed questionable.
With regard to Bayles, 19-year-old viral tweet since the beginning of this week is now of a completely new importance:
Police: 3 victims of serial murder shot while listening to car music
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who had been killed during the most deadly attack on the first serial killer of Phoenix in the last decade sat in the car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to the police reports issued on Thursday.
Angela Rochel Leiner, Stephanie R. Ellis and daughter Ellis, Malia, were shot on 12 June when their car was parked on the carriageway, declared to the authorities.
The perpetrator fired about eight shots from the gun, standing on the passenger side of the car, and then hid on another vehicle, the report said.
Police say that the triple murder appears not to be the result of a robbery, because the criminal didn't take a wallet or $2,900 that was at the disposal of one of the adult victims.
A representative of Phoenix Police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting had prompted investigators to check whether he had been involved in the four previous attacks.
Only seven people were killed and two others injured as a result of nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas within four months.
“It’s happening in the residential area in front of the house,” said Howard KPHO, the CBS branch office, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including the brown Nissan late in the 1990s, the black BMW in the late 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were connected and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Malia, were killed on the scene.
The witness told the police that there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which was an empty truck half an hour before a three-hour murder, which was believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
The investigators found shells and pulled the bullet out of the seat and fragments of the bullet from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephalia: "Being better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixivto loves singing, toys, and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund microcephalia is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Pixivto, did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was — I couldn’t do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't sign for it.
That, in fact, it's not true that you're going to sign for it," she said.
Her and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized medical facility.
“My first answer was, “I didn’t think people were doing that anymore”, Pixivto explained.
Edmund's walking through the halls.
Edmund didn't sit and crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But it's slow going through some of the stages.
He's going with outside help and riding a bicycle.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture that Edmund invented for "please sing me."
"We teach his sign language," said Pixivto CBS News.
But not just the usual sign language, she says that Edmund has chosen his own gestures.
Microcephalia may occur due to a number of different circumstances: genetic infections, such as those of Edmund, during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and zika.
Symptoms and projections may vary considerably.
It's too early to talk about how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zik virus.
Pixivot recalls emotional loss due to an uncertain future.
Did I keep telling you what would happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't really ask for a life forecast because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Pixivto has encouraging advice for mothers of children with congenital defects because of Zeek.
It'll get better.
You know things will get better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, floods cause rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the Governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more precipitation expected to take place before Saturday.
Numerous rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and the south of Mississippi had left the coasts and were threatened by widespread flooding following extreme precipitation, reported the National Meteorological Service.
Governor Louisiana John Bell Edwards stated that government officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and that assistance has already gone to the affected arrivals.
Mike Steel, a representative of the Office of the Governor of National Security and Emergency Preparedness, stated that transportation requests for high water, boats and sandbags were received.
Steele said that only Tanjipaho’s arrival had asked for tens of thousands of bags of sand.
The risk of flooding remains in effect until Saturday in the majority of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3-5 inches could overrun the area.
In southern Alabama, the raid was expected to take place until Friday, as the rain continued to flow in the Mobila area.
The Comit River near Baton Rouge and the Amit River near Day Springs, both in Louisiana, were expected to establish a record level of flood in the past weekend.
synoptic Alec Krautmann said that both rivers could sink many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flooding that was going down in the direction of the Assensen arrival was a threat, as these reedy rivers would slow down into Lake Morpa.
The Tikfo River, just south of the state of Mississippi in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever registered at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Saviours were still pulling people out of the Amit and Wilkinson floods in the south-west of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his mistress were among the early rescues on Fridays near Glaster.
Hansford, age 62, says that the waters of Beaver Creek, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said that another sheepfold who lived nearby had warned him.
"We woke up, and the water kept coming," said Hansford.
She's reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford that it was the biggest tributary she'd ever seen in 48 years that she lived here.
Hansford said he and all his family had disabilities, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said the rescue workers rescued all three of them by means of an army truck and brought them to a fire station in Gloster, where they hid on Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood was spreading rapidly, as the rains continued, noting that officials were considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingstone reported a drop of 13.75 inches of rain from midnight until Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the soil had been irrigated with rainfall from the environment.
Heavy rain and street flooding have led to work to save the people from homes in Tanjipahoa's arrival and the abolition of classes in five school districts, the authorities state.
WWL, CBS branch, reports that the adviser Tangypahoa reported 200 flooded houses.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, but they're both warming up now.
The President of the Arrival of Robbie Miller stated that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals in high water.
The shelters were opened in the city of Amit and the city of Hammond to welcome those who had been evacuated.
"They will have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water starts to retreat," he said.
In the town of Hammond, the arrival of Tangypaho, about two dozen streets were closed because of the high water level and sand bags were available to deliver to residents in the hope that they would keep water away from homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said the city manager Lacey Landrum.
This is about to become a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, the head of the Emergency Service, Rupert Lacey, reported that heavy rain continued to flow to the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, but no houses were registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, the manager of the Shopper Value Foods store in Amit, lives in this area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," said Tawson, "and she's still on the ground."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "dotted with bullets", remains alive after a shooting in Philadelphia.
Police report that a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, recording a six-year-old shooting in a city this week.
Grandmother and grandfather of the child identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
Grandma and Grandpa say Brown suffered numerous gunshot wounds, including his arm, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He's got a lot of it, his little body was shot with bullets," says his grandmother Delores Melendez at the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has survived several operations.
The family told the station that he was expected to recover.
He was supposed to go to first grade at the local primary school.
Brown was one of the four people who were shot in the German Town Square.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-olds.
It is reported that one of the 29-year-old men was in critical condition; two other victims were registered in a stable state, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot dead in the front seat of a car near a 29-year-old in critical condition, reports the station.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police were investigating whether any of the wounded men could have been the shooter.
Investigators report to CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been a shooting between several armed people.
Balls of semi-automatic weapons attributed to various copies of semi-automatic weapons have settled the scene.
It seems to have definitely been a long battle.
There were shells on the street, on both sides of the pavement.
Therefore, it seems that there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting," police chief Anthony Ginaldi reported.
Many homes and cars in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made, and the police have reportedly been watching video surveillance cameras.
The other six-year-old girl was struck in the hand of a sewing bullet Tuesday when she played in front of her home in West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabby and Lori?
That's what I call this year's Olympic Gymnastics Gymnastics Gym, and for a number of reasons.
First, I've been at every Summer Olympic since 1984, and the United States has never been so domineering.
And the second is that three gymnasts, Simon Byles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernández, have already inspired so many white girls.
The composition of this collection, supplemented by Eli Reisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This assembly looks like America at last.
This also strengthened the black and Latin American female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, female gymnast number one has been African American.
Last year, Simon and Gabby were number one and number two.
It's powerful.
In the past Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed it.
Now the world could witness the incredible performances of the three-time Peace Championships by Simona Byles, Douglas and Laurie Hernández, performing unexpected but nevertheless virtual gymnastics exercises.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth American in a row, winning gold in a woman's individual absolute primacy.
And a colleague at Eli Reisman's collection earned silver.
We're witnessing the peak of this sport, but it doesn't look like it in gym sections all over the country.
Simona, Gabby and Laurie have all chosen the same path as Ali and Madison to form the Olympic Assembly.
They're the final five because the next Olympic gymnast will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is the last year of Martha Caroley's training.
But gymnasts are actually expensive sport, and gymnasts are first trained in private gymnasts supported by parents who pay the cost of training, equipment, travel, form, contributions for participation in competitions, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnast clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get everything from their training, and this is an expensive and long-term responsibility for the gymnast families.
Amy Burman, coach Simona Byles, and Maggie Hanni, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they adopted the gymnast.
We must create a more affordable and accessible training for gymnastics communities of the vast number of young girls inspired by Simona, Gabby and Lori.
I founded my gymnast fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and inexpensive gymnasts in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and Latin American) and have raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand in Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Hymnasty develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resilience to debilitating work, discipline and perseverance for the mind.
This combination has a positive effect throughout life on good health, success in school and work.
It is the inspiration of this gathering that will send thousands of girls to do gymnastics, and it is wonderful.
Sports is so important, especially for girls.
It's such a great time now.
Thank you, Simona, Eli, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Women's Force in the win of the Olympic team and for motivating so many girls of different backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors have taken on further strikes since Jeremy Hunt's proposal was rejected.
The Ministers hoped to end the change dispute by agreeing with the British Medical Association leaders, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who had voted rejected it.
In July Hunt announced plans to enter the treaty, said that the NHS was on "nobody's land" and any subsequent delay would cause damage to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes night shifts and weekends to improve out-of-time services.
Dr. Ellen McCott, chairman of the Committee of Young Physicians" BMA, said last night in a statement: “The junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that he will raise the existing labour crisis and that he cannot apply to all doctors fairly.”
Only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors was transferred to a new contract, progress was needed and time was running out.
The BMA's attempt to resolve the dispute through negotiations was met with a reluctance to act and sometimes with complete silence from the Government.
And that despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door was always open.
"Jeremy Huntou needs to act now, to inspire the introduction and to respond to the fears of the younger doctors.
If he doesn't, then the junior doctors are clear that they're ready to stage a follow-up strike.
The last strike at the end of April delayed some 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nurses, while nurses and consultants were engaged to replace doctors on the picket line.
The Ministers hoped to end the change dispute by agreeing to the amended treaty with the heads of the British Medical Association.
WMA wants better payouts for 54,000 junior doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS Employees, called on junior doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer stated: “The strikes are small or nothing, but they put pressure on the already working teams and services and cause anxiety, physical pain and disorders to patients, sitters and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have spoken with the Committee of Associate Physicians and together with the Department of Health and others, and have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of guardians and corporate information policies.
Workers hoped that continued positive support on other important topics, such as staff distribution, flexibility of training, additional training for those returning after career break, cost of training, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender pay gap in medicine, was a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Health Department met the conditions achieved by the WMA in November, February and May.
A $2 a day drug can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients with heart attack are going to use the drug for £2 a day, after the authorities have recommended that they give it to more people and for longer periods.
The reverse agent of ticagrelor reduces the risk of relapses for people with heart problems.
The drug is already assigned 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or new onset.
The NICE Monitoring Service of the British National Health Service recommended that it be given to the people for four years in order to continue to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE Monitoring Service of the British National Health Service has now recommended that it be given to the people for four years in order to continue to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack occurs with about 140,000 people in England each year, with four of them having another stroke or stroke.
Cardiac seizures and strokes result from the accumulation of fat on the walls of the arteries and the formation of blisters.
If the blister breaks apart, it can cause a thromboembolism, blocking blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
And if the clot moves, it can move through the flow of blood and block the bloodstream to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who are already under one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
The ticagrelor produced by the British firm AstraZeneca and sold by Brilique reduces the risk by making the trumpets less likely.
The draft NICE instruction, published today, recommends that people give 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Despite effective secondary prevention techniques with about a quarter of those who have had a heart attack, there is another heart attack or stroke, often with devastating effects.”
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of human life.
There is evidence that ticagrelor, combined with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
With the preliminary recommendation of ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to increase treatment options available to many thousands of people who are willing to use ticagrelor.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor — especially the risk of bleeding — is limited in three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment longer than that.
The culture of ownership of the PC allows for the prosperity of the falsification of the count of votes in Muslim areas
The Tower-Hamletts Ex-Mer Lutfur Rahman was suspended last year because of corruption, as a result of the Government's report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the closure of the eyes, which has turned out to be a widespread falsification of the vote in Muslim communities, according to the devastating report of the Government released today.
The former cabinet member, Sir Eric Pickles, is critical of police, election observers and city administration for ignoring the allegations of electoral violations due to “extreme sensitivity to race and religion”.
The former secretary of the local communities, now the anti-corruption king, reported that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so strong that the police had to be allowed to put borders outside the polling stations in order to protect the frightened voters.
He suggests that voters take identity cards to prove who they are when they vote.
For the time being, voters must simply state their name and address.
The report even suggests putting unscathed ink on people's fingers when they hand over their ballots, so that someone can vote twice.
We need to provide better protection to the informants, Sir Eric said.
It calls for greater access by the press to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“This is not only done to protect itself from electoral fraud, but also to protect the local Government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it,” he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street following a vote in Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, the Special Court dealing with electoral matters ruled that the existing mayor, Luftur Rahman, was to be removed from office in connection with a long list of corruption and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman had “cyssically distorted” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and had silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rakhman said: "He led his campaign on the basis of the duty of the Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 voices have raised doubts or have been the result of a person’s vote, representing someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the fraud by post, in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly put pressure on people to vote for their candidate.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made a few recommendations to clear the voting system, including a requirement to bring his identity card to prove who you are.
The report states: “They have provided evidence of the pressure exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, in particular women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, particularly in Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities.
“There were fears that... public institutions had closed their eyes to such conduct due to the excessive sensitivity of “political correctness” over ethnicity and religion”.
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the removal of political activists from the post office ballots to stop the "voice harvesting".
The report, before Teresa May, also calls for tighter registration checks to prevent the use of the voter list for immigration fraud and privileges.
The option is being considered to require voters to present the identity card before the vote.
Use unsmokered inks on people's fingers as soon as they drop their ballot paper to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Undertake systematic checks of the nationality of the people to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Enter a three-year limit on applications for automatic postal ballots.
Disposal of political participants in campaigns and activists from work with filled-out ballots and envelopes, with a postal vote.
To give the police the power to set boundaries around polling stations.
Amend the law to make it easier for people to be charged with intimidation under the National Act 1983.
Take illegal photographs at polling stations.
Require that only English be used at polling stations (except Wales).
To strengthen training to ensure that the staff makes the voters go to the booth one by one.
Sir Eric is aggressively attacking the city police, claiming that this is “convincing” that no criminal charges have been filed since the Tower Hamlets case.
“The electoral court has disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of acts of corruption and illegality”, he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of reasonable doubt — a criminal standard of proof — on a number of grounds.
It also criticizes the lack of results-based “foreign check-ups” of the polling offices in city administrations.
Sir Eric stated: “The court order in Tower Hamlet last year was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliamentary elections, yet the alarming and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Headset by the cycling analogy of Kate and other doppelgangers of the Rio Olympics
The fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics went crazy this week on French cyclist Pauline Ferran-Prevo, who appeared to be very impressively like the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old member of the Olympic Games is not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer, who can boast of his own famous double, at least according to social media reports.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous people who appear on our screens so far, FEMAIL has a list of Olympics with more than a surface similarity to the Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: Brady Ellison, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to being a double Kate on a bicycle track, many people have rushed online to point out how a certain archer could be a twin superstar, Leonardo DiCaprio.
A male U.S. archers team member Brady Ellison was the cause of a hurricane on Twitter after the images of him appeared, a frighteningly similar to a Wolf star with Wallstreet.
And in fact, the archer learned of the insaneness of the social networks and admitted that he had heard that he looked like Leo since he was a kid.
"I personally don't see a huge similarity, perhaps except vegetation on the face," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will no doubt show even more this year: the striking similarity between the British Greg Razerford drive and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Alia Mustafa, with her big, expressive eyes, is said to be an accurate copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the South African swimming pool, Cameron Van der Bourgo was compared with the star Chore Matthew Morrison for many years.
Turning to the more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan is the “sportable” version of the actor “Phale”
Another long-standing comparison was between tennisist Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Hartett, who may boast similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
A silver medalist swimmer from Russia, Julia Efimova, may boast not only the same tanned skin and light hair as the actress AnnaLinn McCord, while Nathan Adrian of the US team, according to fans, looks like a "sporting version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
Raw women: Hope Solo Football Star, left, and Jennifer Carpenter actress from Dexter, right, have the same faces and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities.
Creation of a theory: According to this user there may be a reason underlying the similar appearance of this couple
One Twitter user recently contacted the website to publicize its excitement that “the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are really the same.”
In fact, U.S. football star and actor Dexter have incredibly similar faces and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of Laura Lynne's actress, as well as the winning gold medalist Gabby Douglas, who can boast of her own beautiful broad smile, which looks like the smile of the star "Be successful" Gabriel Union.
The CBC commentator on the Olympics apologizes for saying about the Chinese fin "dead as a pig"
Byron McDonald's analysis of the fourth place in 14-year-old Ai Yanhan on a women's 4x200m-style fast-track instigated open-ended 4x200m on the average of CBC viewers in direct Olympiad broadcasts
The Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of her commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "started as a scent" and "dead as a pig" during the flood.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he began expressing his own opinion at the end of the final female estaphet 4x200 m freestyle.
You could hear McDonald, who was brought to the CBC commentator team to "dilute it with color," he said, "This 14-year-old Chinese woman dropped the ball, baby."
Too excited, started like a fire, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
China’s 14 - year - old Ai Janhan floater sailed a second step in 1:57,79 — down 1.61 seconds slower than Canada’s Taylor Rak, allowing Canadians to remove the delay from China.
Viewers across Canada responded quickly to the web after being shocked by the tone and expressions used
Emmet McFarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC actually just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China died like a pig?"?
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
And Janjan of China, in the finals of the women's estaphette 4x200 m freestyle, said, "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby."
The Twitter critics immediately attacked Byron McDonald, and many called for his dismissal
Twitter users didn't stand by when they heard how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradiz, wrote: 'Nothing to yourself #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us like a racist bunch. #disgusted.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was transmitting to the CBC, apologized live for the McDonald's comment, saying, 'We apologize for the comment that the talk on navigation has reached the air'.
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened'.
The SAF concluded by apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to this speech
A friend of commentator Scott Russell had to apologize to McDonald's
CBC then copied and apologized to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained to McDonald's comments
Telesetti also rushed to apologize and to publish a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to go on air.
Last night we acted quickly to apologize to our viewers on live air and our socialist subscribers.
Let's be clear, Byron's comments were about a swimmer, not her personality.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday, McDonald apologized lively and tried to clarify his commentary, stating that he did not think that his words were interpreted as assaulting a person.
'I'd like to take this moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's estaphet,' he said at the CBC Olympics broadcast.'
'I was talking about a swimmer's performance, not her personal.'
'It's only self-evident that there was no disrespect, and I'm sorry.'
Buyer Primark insulted a woman who unfavorably compared her underwear in the middle of the store
The buyers didn't know where to take a look when a woman got naked to look at the panties on the floor with the shops in the middle of Primark.
Worse yet, she illustrated what she looked like, drew them, and put them back on the regiment.
She continued to search and eventually died four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place mall in Volkswagen.
The Primark store at Bouverie Place in Volkswagen, where a woman used twitches before putting them back on the shelf
The mother of the two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the store at the time, said that after a sample of the underwear, a mysterious woman went out and went out of the store and bought nothing.
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the mall, she took a couple of underwear out of the window, took off her own cobblers and shorts and put them on.
"She didn't try to find a safe place to do that -- she was just standing there, shameless."
"They all got together when she took her panties off again, and she obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same with three other couples before she finally decided that there was nothing she liked, dressed and left here.
"She doesn't seem to care who's been watching her, or that she's thinking about the person who's finally going to buy those underwear she's been doing."
33-year-old Jenny Davidson of Kent said, "It's against the idea that someone is going to take the underwear home that someone else was already wearing and they weren't posted."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I find that the staff seem to have tried to remove these clothes from the sale after she left, which is better."
"I wouldn't want to come home with a new pair of women's underwear and find out that another woman wore them and took them off, and they weren't postulated."
The representative of Primark reported: “Primark knows about the incident that took place at our store in Volkswagen on Tuesday, 9 August.”
All the goods concerned were removed from the sale.
How to protect yourself from assaults with a gun using a magistre.
The surrounding world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Miszazi, the magistrate of the Federation of Cows in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether they come to you from the front or the back, this video will show you how to beat the man who stole his weapon.
If they come from behind, as Miszazi said, the first thing to do is to turn around so that you can see the attacker and " release the line of fire".
Then you tightly squeeze a gun between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting them in the face with a free elbow.
Then the knee comes in the groin, and while the assailant shrinks from the pain, you twist the gun out of his hands, punch it in the face with the gun, and walk back, holding the weapon on it.
For an armed man in front, a way to do it looks like, take your body off the line of fire, grab a gun quickly, and twist it so that the villain can't shoot.
At the same time, move the weight to the gun and hit the bullet in the chest, then turn the gun out of its grip before you go back and aim at it.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video to see how Miszacci does it.
But remember, the safest way out of any robbery — if you're not the master of a pack of cows is to give up your cash.
For a traveller, Jan Wright keeps his language in the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveller has subjected his immune system and a brutal reflex to a serious test by licking some of the most filthy and disgusting places in Europe.
The lead and author of the books on Jan Wright's travels, 51, from Saffolk, spoke the euro banknotes, the Piccadilly Pearls, the button of the Unitase on the train and the Russian public telephone to prove the power of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment, which should become a film called "Lisbon Guide to the Inner Force", has produced some surprising results.
The idea of dropping the flush button on a train used by thousands of others may be very disgusting, but there are actually more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout the trip to Europe, Wright talked to doctors and health workers about the growth of intestinal bacteria and their own health.
Fortunately, none of the licked things brought him more than bad taste in his mouth.
Wright was known for his gut’s strength tests, traveling around the world, and eating strange and amazing things.
From public railings on railway stations to a button to flush the toilet, this task certainly tested his immune system.
In the film that he filmed, he said, "From childhood I have been completely careless about my health, and I have dragged many different things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
Its sample oil has demonstrated a luminometer of more than 4,000 units.
In comparison: the hands just washed must be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick after the meaning of his luminometer was more than 4,000 units, while the hands just washed showed less than 60
Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio filmed a traveller entitled “Lisbon Guide to the Interior Force”, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as toilets.
He said, "This is close to one of the worst things I ever smelled in the bathroom."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything 'cause it's freezing.
"Lisbon Traveller's Guide to the Internal Force" was removed with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains acidic bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human intestine bacteria and to develop the immune system.
Senior Vice President Valio said on snacks, juices and new categories of Niko Vvorenmaa: 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to look at and at the same time could explain the benefit of probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended with the idea of "let's call Jan".
They claim that interest in the health of the intestine becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of the health of the intestine and how it relates to the immune system.
Growing interest in intestine health is a global phenomenon, and through this documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the movie shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakal, who was the director of the film, said, "Let's say I'd lose respect for Jan if he'd licked some of the stuff I asked for, like, the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the movie."
Of course, some of Jan’s clothes were easier to lick, and some were rather rigid.
I'm glad we managed to get some of these licks on film.'
During the 2015 survey, Valio, 84 per cent of respondents linked acid bacteria exclusively to the good stomach and intestine status and 58 per cent said that they used at least occasionally products containing the added acid bacteria.
A family of hooligans destroyed Saltash, the municipal house of Cornwall, on the evicted evicted day
A family of hooligans left their municipal home with losses of £50,000 after they were evicted for intimidation of their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner, Sean Trebilkok, were expelled from their real estate facility in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they had been forcibly evicted from the property, shocked housing and building cooperatives discovered this property in a state of repair.
The walls were left with glistening holes, the shelves were exposed, the debris was scattered on the floor and the walls were sprinkled with graffiti.
The family is now moved and is supposed to live in a private apartment.
Donna McEway, a settler at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid she wouldn't save him.
She said, 'It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people have to live like this.
There are a lot of things that need to be weighed down, because this object of real estate is likely to be known as not the very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation, and their name has a bad reputation.
A couple of three sons who lived in a real estate facility from time to time, and the police report that the realm of terror caused by the family included fighting on the street with baseball bats, intimidation of residents of nearby areas, drug abuse, drug trafficking, excessive shouting, disputes and harassment.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease contract, received a warrant for anti-social conduct in June.
In several rooms of a house that could be demolished, they found old garbage.
The floorboards in the house where drugs were sold in the past were removed
Neighbors say they saw fights on the street and regularly called the police.
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of the house this week after being granted an extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The eviction was relieved to welcome the neighbors who said that their lives had been turned into hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We've lived with them for 20 years, and that's always been bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is amazing.
'That morning we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet here, we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, everything's gonna be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the neighborhood group Cornwall Housing, said the family was unable to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in a house for 20 years, with the police, and they regularly called the police.
The garbage and old toys were scattered below the old side of the municipal house.
He added: 'It is a disgrace that the tenant could not accept any responsibility for the conduct of her and her family, because eviction is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
It was a very complicated case, because the behavior was extreme, and their actions must have been horrifying to her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community have put forward to give us information.
I hope that this development will give the neighbours some comfort and signal that social behaviour will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but he said that they were all a little over 20.
Dirty mattress, left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after eviction
Resettlement workers will now have to remove the chest of garbage that surrounds the house.
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 g of cannabis, as well as weights corresponding to supplies and £1700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after he found himself guilty of possession of class B drugs for supply.
She said the money was going to pay for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After they were made homeless, there was evidence that Tanya and her partner were now living in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms at home were sprayed with graffiti all over the surface.
Police say they will try to evict tenants who are not subject to rent rules.
Angela Crowe, of Devon and Cornwall Police, stated that this eviction had sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to break the rules.
'This is a message for those who feel that they can act without charge of the prosecutor and those who are harmed by such conduct,' she said.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be allowed by the Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a low-flying military aircraft almost touched the beach
In the city of Avira in Portugal, tourists who admire the sun were afraid of their lives
P-3C Orion of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low
Air force reports that he was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no security risk.
This is the moment when frightened tourists start panicking, while the moment when the low-flying plane ransacked over a crowded beach.
A military aircraft is seen on the dramatic footage and is almost at the distance from the sand hunters in Avirro, northern Portugal.
As soon as they became understandably concerned about the sound of the aircraft ' s engines, the rest of the breathers jumped to their feet, but could not see what was going through the clouds.
The incident took place yesterday evening not far from the city of Awira in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandesh, one of the few breathers who published a video of a shocking social network pass, said, "He flew down very low twice, and there was a moment when it seemed like he was going to break up."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was in the surfing business, and I swear, it felt like the plane was about to fall on me."
Tourists on the beach of Avery were horrendous when the plane appeared from the mist and flew at a very low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force stated today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft carried out a training flight to detect fishing vessels off the coast and was forced to descend as low as it was the only way to check them.
The pilot stated that the aircraft had flown a little lower than usual due to the lack of visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted that no one had been exposed to danger.
This summer, forest fires damaged mainland Portugal and killed four people on Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot had to fly so low because of the circumstances — a thick fog and might from the forest fires that worsened visibility
The aircraft operated a training flight, and the pilot was assigned to detect fishing boats within the task force.
CASSP has been mandatory for more than a year, but most of the restaurants and restaurants in St. Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
Audits are becoming more active and businesses are facing fines of up to 1 million roubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system, in the Russian version of HSSP, is a risk analysis and critical checkpoint, which is mandatory for the use of food producers and carriers, as well as general food companies in Russia as a member of the Customs Union (TC).
Business audits by the Rossi Superintendent to meet these standards in Petersburg began in February 2015.
But so far, officials only issue fines for individual infringements of the regulations (see “Refugement of documents”...).
The failure to comply with the rules will in general cost an enterprise of 600,000 roubles for the first violation and 1 million roubles for the second.
CASSP, as a system that takes into account the risks associated with and prevents food, was developed in the United States in the 1960s.
Then it was about the safety of astronaut food.
The system is now being used in all food businesses not only in the United States but also in Canada and in the European Union.
CASSP has been operating in TC since February 2015.
It was 4 years for the development and implementation of the business system (the demand for HSSP appeared in the TC Techregulatory System in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials admit that most companies have not even heard of this norm.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the norm concerns only food productions, not restaurants, and explained the head of the Social Council, Elena Czereteli.
Now everyone's trying to make up for the missed one.
The expected date for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey - at the end of August - is early September.
But they're not going to demand anything because their target audience, their families with their children, is getting ready for school, and experts are saying.
The Tourist Agency Alliance sent a letter yesterday to the Government asking that the charters be cleared.
“For many Russian tourists, the issue of the selection of quality and affordable maritime rest is unsolved, as most of the sites in the resorts of the Krasnodar Region and the Republic of Crimea are already banned by the end of September”, the authors of the letter noted, stressing that the opening of charter transport in August would not have a significant impact on the already established demand for Russian maritime tourism.
As reported at the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Union of Turin Industry (RST), if the aviation authorities of Russia and Turkey agree quickly, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding of when charters will be renewed until they do so depends primarily on aviation authorities.
In September, even August, the aircraft may be able to fly, even if the tour operators quickly build programmes and agree with the airlines on what is needed on board," said Pavel Rumyants, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects of the North-West Regional Office of the RST.
According to him, the possible renewal of charters is good news, but it will not affect the distribution of power in the market, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from rest and are preparing for school or taking holidays in other countries.
In the colorful season, tours are mostly single travelers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who can rest spontaneously," said Paul of the Romanians.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists if it now makes very budget proposals - 50-600,000 roubles for two tours, because there are people who are deliberately waiting for very cheap tours," says Valeria Rosenthal, director-general of Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, it's not worth it. The main mass of travel is already planned.
Paul of the Romanians also believes that since there is a demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be needed, but the waiting attitude is not worth waiting for.
"For Turkey, starting charters now is a rehearsal for the next season," said Pavel Rumiants.
“Opening charters in Turkey is positive news for the next season” agreed by Valeria Rubtsov.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption from the compensation payments provided by the law within the limits of the approved rules relating to compensation for damage caused by injury or other damage to health.
The issuance of milk to workers working with harmful working conditions is provided for under the established rules under article 222 TC of the RF.
At the same time, the rules and conditions of extradition are laid down by the Ministry of Health of Russia Order No. 45n of 16.02.2019.
According to this document, the free distribution of milk or other equivalent foodstuffs is made to workers on days of actual employment in hazardous work arising from harmful production factors in the workplace.
Based on these rules, the Russian Federation's FNA concluded in the letter under consideration that, pursuant to paragraph 2(3) of article 217 of the RCF, income from the levy on milk issued to workers on days of actual employment in hazardous work under the Terms and Conditions approved by the Russian Ministry of Health Development Order of 16.02.2019 No. 45n was exempt.
Moscow's Gazstroybank has remained without a license from CB.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia withdrew a licence for bank transactions from the credit organization Activary Commercial Bank of GASSTROIBANK, registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, the ACS "GASSTROIBANC" has implemented high-risk credit policies related to the placement of money in low-quality assets.
Adequate assessment of the risks taken at the request of the supervisory authority and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank ' s assets have led to the credit organization ' s justification for the implementation of bankruptcy prevention measures.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in questionable transit operations.
The Bank has appointed a temporary administration until its appointment in a competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive organs of the credit organization under federal law have been suspended.
AS "GASSTROIBANC" is a member of the deposit insurance system.
Recall that the payment of insurance payments to depositors of the bank, including individual entrepreneurs, under Federal Act No. 177-FZ, “On insurance of the contributions of individuals to banks of the Russian Federation” is 100 per cent of the balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million roubles in total per investor.
Payments, according to the Deposit Insurance Agency, will commence no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the report, the assets of AO ACS "GASSTROIBANC" were 335 in the banking system as of 1 August 2016.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIS died in Syria
Cadiz Sultan, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, was reportedly killed in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnim Akundji stated that her family had learned about her death in Rakka, Syria, a few weeks ago.
It is believed that she died of a Russian air strike in Rakka, a patchwork of factions in the country, as reported by ITV News on Thursday.
Sultan was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just as she planned to leave a war - torn country and return to England.
“It can only be hoped that the only advantage of this is the gravestone and the will of others, that it is precisely the risks involved when travelling to the war zone to dissuade people from ever making the same choice,” said Akundji.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London boarded a plane to Turkey and then on a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultana family said that she had married an IGIL soldier in Syria and had become a widow for several months.
Reed states that Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court on election.
The leader of the Democrats in the Senate, Harry Reed, said he was convinced that a democratic candidate for President Hillary Clinton would nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected as President.
The Senate members blocked Garland's claim, but as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The leader of the majority group in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, states that the next president will elect the person who can replace the last Supreme Court judge Antonin Skalia.
Reed stated at the conference on Thursday that he predicted that Clinton would choose Garland "with some degree of confidence".
The representative Reed later said he didn't talk to Clinton directly about whether she was going to move Garland, and just made assumptions.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team wouldn't want to "deploy the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the principal judge of the United States Court of Appeal in Colombia.
Reed stated that the republicans who block the nomination of Garland were “princes” and “means” of the Republic's candidate for President Donald Trump.
He said Trump wasn't fit for the job.
Treats states that erotic calendars for 'women, as well as for men'
The Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellmer to release a 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of exposed celebrities, they're trying to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with exposed museums.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of exposed models is different from old-fashioned Playboy because Playboy is for men.
I do it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is the same.
“We need to go back to the demonstration of an eternal and classic naked figure, where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a woman’s body,” said Shaw in a press release declaring the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can take pictures online or personally at open cassettes in Los Angeles and New York.
Moscow will be able to share memories of bad Internet stores.
In Moscow, they're going to release a memorial that tells us how not to be a victim of an Internet store.
This was reported in Rosso-Needszor, says M24.
Officials are reported to be preparing a memorial that will help citizens to choose an Internet store properly and identify possible fraud schemes.
The concept of this brochure provides for several sections.
These will be general information and a legislative framework, rules for the delivery of goods, ways of protecting their legal rights.
The annex will provide recommendations on how the claim is correctly drawn up and so on," said Rossokorez.
The memory is being refined to this point.
Subsequently, it will be posted on the Rospowidzorka website in Moscow, and it is also planned to release a print version and distribute it to Moscow.
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs issued a statement calling the name of the second suspect in organizing a diversion in Crimea.
Ukrainian and Russian nationals were detained and assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts.
Among them are Panov Evgeny Alexandrovic and Zacaj Andrej Romanović.
"They all give confessions," said the communication.
Formerly resident of the Zaporozhye District, Evgeny Panov, who was detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in Crimea, pleaded guilty to interrogation.
FAS fines Google for 438 million roubles.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine of 438 million rubs on Google's website.
“The penalty for Google for violation of antimonopoly legislation was 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will complete our decision and pay the fine soon," said Deputy Head Alexey Docenko of FAS.
During the investigation, FAS found that Google provided manufacturers with smartphones sold in Russian territory with Google Play apps only if other corporate applications were installed on the device.
Among these applications is the search system, which should be located on the main smartphone screen.
Thus, the corporation violates Article 10, Article 10, on the protection of competition (abuse of dominance).
We are confident that the enforcement of the regulation will provide an opportunity for the development of competition in the mobile PO market in Russia, which will have a favourable effect on our consumers.
The Competition Protection Act must be respected by all companies that are supplied to the Russian Federation and transnational corporations, including, the head of the Communications and Information Technology Regulatory Office of the Russian Federation, Elena Zaeva.
The government suspects a conspiracy of 16 Russian stores.
The New Book Network has fined for selling the book 50 days before my suicide.
New Book Stores have been fined for selling the book "50 days before my suicide" by Stace Kramer, the City News Agency of Moscow.
According to Rossokowiatzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be seen as “promoting or motivating the suicidal behaviour of children and adolescents”.
The Minsk District Court confirmed a violation of the established requirements for the distribution of information products to children and decided to impose a fine of 49 copies of the printed products arrested by the Roskobnadzor Office.
The source in the New Book confirmed that it was a Stace Kramer.
In March of this year, it was reported that Moscow's major bookshops were carrying out checks on the availability of the book 50 days before my suicide.
It's going to be the night of Ernst Unknown's memory in Moscow.
In Moscow there will be an evening of memory of sculptor Ernst Unknown, TASS reports.
The event will take place on 15 August at the central house of the literators.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say good-bye to the Unknown in the United States personally.
It was therefore decided to set up this evening for those who wanted to exchange it on their own land,” stated the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress.
It was noted that it was important for the widow of sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
In the evening, close friends of the Unknown are invited, including the poet Evgeny Evtushenko, the artist Boris Messererer, President of the Pushkin GMI Irina Antonov, director Mark Rosovsky, and Russian Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky, Head of Culture of Moscow, Alexander Kibowski, Deputy Mayor of Moscow Leonid Pečatnikov.
It has previously been reported that Ernst Unknown's relatives are planning to hold a paniade for a sculptor in New York until 14 August.
The final consumer was guilty: who actually buys the plates?
Single middle-aged men love guilt.
And so long as you haven't been able to squander a section of the comments by gross insults under the name NeVsEssEssexMen mid-years, this allegation is derived from actual data.
According to YouGov, so much of the discussion of the recovery of plates is due not to the boom among the generation of two thousand, who want to penetrate a novel material object but to the nostalgia of the middle years.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album with a high probability range ranged from 45 to 54, according to data.
Moreover, those belonging to the 18-24 age group are the least likely.
It is also not just an act of gathering lovers - it has an emotional significance: the older buyers are more likely to hold their feelings within themselves (56% versus 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% versus 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were a television news story, the camera would follow me while I'm at the centre of Soho's lively street, in a humble, gray suit and violently gestured before the stop, folding my hands and saying something impressive like, "Let's see."
Okay, let's see.
While Socho’s heart slowly loses its charm and dirt — the hotel, the cafes, and the shopkeepers of Paperchase are now in the middle of buildings, once occupied by independent sellers — several musical stores with fantastic specialists remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene where I'm close to different people in some of these stores and try to assess their age and emotional mood through observation.
Glasgow Stewart, 55 years old, for which I went from Sister Ray (calculation of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (calculation of data: eight middle-aged men, one woman probably over 20 years old) in London for the afternoon to meet, and go shopping for a few hours.
He's a collector, I ask?
"I suppose so," he says.
I've got about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These records, as shown above (he sent me an e-mail, I didn't follow him home) line up the walls of his living room.
His reason for acquiring such a large number of albums and singles is partly derived from his available income: he can now buy plates that he couldn't afford when they just left, and buy items he sold when he was young and small.
"Many of what I'm buying is in the late '60s, early '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things for which I was probably too young to buy," he said.
He agrees that those who buy plates are probably introverts who like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
It's my fault.
Wes, 25 years old, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets match the profile of YouGov.
He noticed, however, a new wave of people who were exposed to media noises, people who had heard about the return and felt the obligation to buy their old records.
Based on the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection, usually about 1998 or 1999.
Clients who once sold their guilt to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their plates," he said.
This may explain the boom among rebirthists of some age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of the plates?
It's enough to spend a few seconds at a store, like Phoenix, to understand that the record stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Weza, some older clients are, inter alia, insulting the impersonal payment system.
Some wine lovers may feel a shock from the digital world and prefer to distance themselves from familiar plastic envelopes, objects that awaken memories of youthlessness.
"I think that sometimes it can be a filling of void or possession of material things as a kind of solace," said Wez.
Since I'm a collector myself, I have it, and I think many people have it too.
It's a simple way to take your head.
"We're their social workers!" a colleague from the ceiling spoke.
The ICM survey in April showed that almost 50 per cent of the people who bought the vinyl album last month had not listened to it.
The survey also found that 41 per cent had a player they never used, whereas 7 per cent had no record player.
At this stage of news reporting, I would probably look seriously puzzled by walking through the ceilings with the Bosanos.
The "trophy" aspect of rebirth is what Johnny observed, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-aged men).
"Someone came in recently and said, "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead plate so that we can put it in front of us," he said.
It's not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More of a piece, less of music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're younger people who aren't old, they're a little less than 20 who'll just get to know this.
Fopp, who now took almost the entire wine floor, has a much more diverse audience when I come.
There are couples who are in their 70s, tourists who take pictures, adolescent boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less forced than in the above-mentioned stores — the latest synthetic and sexy pop Wild Beast, rather than jazz improvisation, penetrates through the columns — it is nice to see the diversity of its customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but painful psychological trauma is difficult to detect after 30 seconds with someone.
Eleonora, 27, walked on Fopp for a few minutes, considering the various plates available for sale.
She's looking at goods, not spending money.
She doesn't make a lot of money, she said, so it's not a very good option to pick up the plates.
It's expensive.
To listen to music on a computer or another device -- just, but the beauty of guilt -- it's ...," she's immersed in dreams with a breath of love.
I don’t know how to explain it — it’s truly extraordinary.
My last stop is a shop that, they say, helped to create a new generation of lovers: Urban fashions.
While I'm creating the illusion that I'm looking at a giant relief shorts, I'm watching a group of teenage girls gathering around the Polaroid chamber every minute before my father and his daughter start talking about buying a Crosley player.
On the left is a stairwell, the wall of which is lined with Adel, Jeff Buckley, Amy Weinhouse and Flitwood Mac: a mixture of modern style and classics, mandatory plates for any middle collection.
No one looks — perhaps because they are simply ornaments, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real "hungry vinyl."
But given that any attention to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few clients to the Soho depths for a while, almost nothing to complain about.
It is not surprising that the segment of the population, which is more likely to have more time and money than most, is the layer that spends most of the money on luxury items, such as wine.
But while my findings show that youGov's results are accurate, at least in Soho's plastic stores, they do not exclude the existence of a large number of women collectors and wine lovers who exist in reality, in record stores and online forums.
These people probably work full - time in school or in offices.
But they obviously don't spend the morning on Thursday, going through the plastic stores on Berwick Street, sneaking out the plates and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year-old fake guide who hangs on the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland’s Polar shark — the longest living vertebral animal — video report
Scientists claim that the Greenland polar shark has the longest life span of all vertebrae on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, states that the female’s record was between 272 and 512 years of age and five metres of age.
The French court rejects the offer to destroy shops in Djungley refugee camp
The French court rejected Kale's offer to demolish dozens of self-made shops and restaurants in Jungley camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At this week's hearings, the Kale authorities stated that the State must be able to tear down a total of 72 self-made shops, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to shave or sell tea for 50 cents (40r) or a simple meal for a few euros in homemade restaurants.
Prefect Kale stated that these places should be destroyed because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they carry fire and sanitation risks.
The humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants were vital, claiming that the free dishes offered by the Bar Association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They said that the shops and restaurants often provide blood and free food to those in need.
The Lille Court held that there was no legitimate basis for expelling people who run 72 self-employed shops, but stated that the problems of Prefecture Kale “was fully understood”.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that bacales, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than simply feeding people who “live under extremely fragile conditions”.
He said that the spaces provided calm points to the meetings of refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the demolition was the children's cafe Book Jungle in the camp, which does not work for the benefit of the camp, offering 200 meals a day, English and French classes and consultations on the provision of asylum for hundreds of vulnerable minors without being escorted to the camp.
Over 170,000 people signed a petition to protect children's cafes.
The letter sent to Guardian stated that its closure would “be a disaster for these children, some of whom are under the age of eight”.
Two charitable institutions, the Refugee Assistance and L'Auberge des Migrans, on Friday, estimated that Jungle had grown to over 9,000 people — the highest in all history — after a sharp increase in the number of new arrivals during the summer.
Micro-area libraries invite young freemen to study programs.

Britain stops on silver in regby-7 after Master Class Fiji allows them to take gold
The impressive British series in Regby-7 was sharply stopped at the final obstacle by the Fiji team in the final Thursday evening, when they were completely destroyed 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji has been given a master class on the possession of ball, rocking, bending, supporting the game, running lines and rough force to win gold — their first Olympic medal of any colour.
The defeat came with not too poor comfort in the form of silver — the third of Britain a day — and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Regby 7 Olympic tournament, in which New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa were beaten along the way.
A painful beating of Boxes, 7-5 in the semifinal earlier that day, could have come back to have a negative effect on them in the final.
But no matter what, Fiji won the best team of 15 in that form.
This may be some consolation for Britain — but probably not — that at least one British will hang a gold medal on her neck tomorrow: Chief Coach Fiji - Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.
That was some travel for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game on Adelaide Sevens.
There's only one thing they've lost here.
These blows will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started off great, for fun's sake, trying to get the British to catch the ball.
It was like pushing a convoy of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and companies, and World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osea Colinisau dived into the corner.
With four minutes in the clock, Jerry Tuway added another touchdown on the right flank, which had been implemented.
12-0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The great attempt at intercepting Mitchell kept Leon Nakarawa from killing a third man, but it only stalled Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jace Veremlua made a touchdown at the right corner, and Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another one after the resumption and there was still more than a minute... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravo then broke through a few other wild attempts to intercept Britain and stormed the line to get a point.
The implementation led to 29-0 being suspended.
It looked as if Fiji were born to play regby-7 while Britain was still mastering the craft.
Which is to a large extent.
Britain was making massive replacements for half the games, and they bought the Fijian Dam... for all four minutes, which was good by the standards of the first half until Joshua Tuisov passed after a few brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton grabbed an attempt for the British by making a touchdown at the left corner to account for 36-7, but the game was long on the way to the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the rostrums.
It was impossible not to admire Fiji’s full joy with her approach.
Mata William embellished a Fijian cake that did not need to be embellished, another attempt in the last seconds.
A whistle sounded, the Fijians embraced, and Britain fell on a gas station, completely defeated.
Earlier on the same day Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in its semifinals, and Britain slightly bypassed South Africa in a tense semifinal of one attempt each — the difference between the British implementation.
Kyle Brown is bringing the Boxes forward in the first half, but Dan Norton with some great work cut the line and scored under the beams in the second half.
The brilliant last attempt to intercept Markus Watson, brother of 15 on the side of the team of England, Anthony, was a victory — and eventually a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win a row fight against cancer.
There will be no more exciting gold in these games, and that says something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy rises in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found additional significance for their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the paddles, there were three voices in the boat, while coach Robin Williams' echo was always as long as they sought the second consecutive Olympic gold in women's couples, the first women in British sports.
Their superiority was absolute, and in the end it was their 39th unconvinced statement, once again unprecedented.
What we see is that two brilliant sportsmen who slip across the surface with the elegance of a swan do not fully reflect the nature of a triumph.
For each gold crest of the battalion of prepared hands, contributing to gradually growing victories that are important, and there are no hands that were more important than the hands of the coach, who 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know whether he would live before he saw that day.
Like he said, it was a dangerous case.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate, and they did.
If they don't do it, he goes everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
She's changing your visions a little bit for the future.
Williamsu was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio was lucky to be able to start treatment in early 2014 in the cross-season, keeping the schedule to a minimum if this could be a correct expression in circumstances like this.
I needed a paycheck, so I had to get better fast.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital, walking through the office — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at the same time, although they spoke quite a few steps.
That's how it starts.
It is a journey, but it makes it a little more.
The next moment after winning, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little bit more than usual, trying to overcome his own feelings.
Stanning, captain of the artillery regiment in Afghanistan behind his shoulders, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week, maybe it's a little too much, but it means so much."
It only confirms how much this means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin, too.
It was fantastic for three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so thank him so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better partner to train or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a single race in five years.
This couple gives a tense rhythm to which their competitors could never match.
Even at the last 500 metres when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much stock.
We were in a lot of trouble.
Helen called, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's very important not to get involved right now.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we didn't try to do anything amazing.
We weren't expecting fireworks today, we were just waiting for us to get warm and get out and win this race, which we did.
It'll take a couple of years to decide their future.
The head needs to be at the wedding next month, on her own with a television searcher of Steve Becksholm's adventures.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say this was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to realize that I had become the Olympic Champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better," she said.
Government extended the term of destruction of authorized products
The Government extended until the end of 2017 the destruction of food prohibited from entering Russia.
The order was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and published on the official legal information portal.
The embargo against countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions because of the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
Subsequently, the ban was repeatedly prolonged and is now in effect until 31 December 2017.
Russia is prohibited from importing certain agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruit and dairy products have been banned.
The eradication of food imported into the country bypassed the embargo has been taking place in Russia since August 2015.
For the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of prohibited products were seized from the sale.
The "prohibition" hunt.
Rain and thunder are expected in Moscow on Friday.
Through the capital region, there will be an atmospheric front that will bring precipitation and lower air temperature.
The air temperature is up to 25 degrees Fahrenheit [25 ° C] during the day.
For example, the short-term rain will take place on Saturday night in Moscow, possible thunderstorms and storms up to 15 m/s.
Rain and thunderstorms are expected to rain during the day to reach 12-17 m/s.
Rains with thunderstorms are also forecast in Orlovsky, Kursk and Voronez regions, reported "Dni.ru".
The rainfall is unlikely for the next working week.
The WTO Arbitration Panel found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the rules of the organization.
Import rates are higher than Russia's commitments when it enters the WTO.
“This is the first time that the WTO has decided against the RF” is stated in a communication on the official website of the organization.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the European Union had not provided sufficient evidence that the measures of Russia were “systematic” or “comprehensive”.
Russia, in turn, promised to soon adapt import duties to paper and refrigerators.
This is indicated in a communication from the Russian Ministry of Economic Development.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intended to complain to the World Trade Organization about the actions of Russia, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in a statement by the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that U.S. conduct in resolving disputed issues in the WTO undermined the organization's discussion principles.
Such a statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members because of the refusal of the Americans to approve Judge Chan Song Hwa of South Korea for a second term.
In this regard, Russia will not apply to the WTO on the question of Western sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It now includes 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The President's Administration has changed.
President Vladimir Putin appointed the head of his own administration to the former deputy Sergey Ivanova Anton Wyno.
Vladimir Putin had made changes to the President's administration and hoped that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the Government and the Kremlin.
Anton Wyno, in turn, stated during the meeting that he considered the important anti-corruption work that had begun to take place in the post of President Ivanov's administration and had promised to cooperate with the Government.
Previously, News said that experts considered the situation of the resignation of Sergei Ivanov as head of the administration of transparent and understandable and repositioning would not fundamentally change the work of the Kremlin administration.
They note that a leader who has worked for the President ' s administration for quite a long time has effectively built up the AP.
Instead, Anton Wyno, deputy head of administration, who knows the specificity of the work, came in.
In Poland, they assume that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
PGNIG, a state-owned oil company, does not exclude that after a few years gas supplies from the Russian Federation may become unattractive to it due to a shift to fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the Vice-President of the Polish Finance Company Boguslav Magez.
His words are conveyed by the MIS.
"It could happen that we are not going to buy the gas at all (in Gazprom), we are now diversifying our supply.
Within the next four years, the main supply lines for us will be East, raw materials from CNG-terminals and Norway," said Mazec.
Gazprom is currently dominated by gas supply in Poland.
PGNIG reported on Friday, 12 August, that in the first half of 2016, a Russian supplier had placed nearly 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas on it, a 30% increase above the 2015 level.
The share of the Russian gas giant in PGNIG procurement increased to 49.8% compared to 40% a year earlier.
Recall that on 22 July, the Polish antimonopoly agency did not agree on the establishment of a joint venture called Gazproma and its European gas pipeline partners, North Stream-2.
This month previously, Poland left Gazprom's request for 11 billion cubic metres of gas on the North Stream-2.
The Vice-President of the Holding Board, Alexander Medvedev, said so.
The North Stream-2 Power auction will take place in 2017 and an auction will be scheduled to take place on its cover in autumn 2016.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom had not yet planned to act on the intention of the Polish side to abandon long-term gas contracts from Russia since 2022, said Alexander Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Management Board.
He recalled that, in the first quarter of this year, Poles had only increased by 42 per cent from the Russian Federation.
Zamwar Gazproma added that the fact that the Polish PGNIG had been filed with the Stockholm Court of Arbitration has not yet ended the negotiations.
The Polish company had previously appealed to the court to reduce the purchase price of Russian gas.
Recall that the authorized Government of Poland on gas and energy infrastructure, Peter Naimsky, reported that the Polish authorities had decided not to extend the gas supply contract with Gazprom.
The Polish contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the authorized Government of Poland on gas and energy infrastructure, Peter Naimsky, stated that his country could, six years later, abandon the supply of blue fuel from the east.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new terminal for liquefied natural gas of Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country to the Norwegian shelf.
The North Stream-2 provides for the construction of two strands of marine gas pipelines with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic metres per year from Russia to Germany at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near the border of Ukraine with Crimea.
The first title of the SMM in Ukraine, Alexander Hugo, reported on this.
"I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area," he said, answering the journalist's question, passing on "RIA Novosti".
According to OSCE, the situation at the border of Ukraine and Crimea is calm, there are no security incidents.
Observers monitored three crossing points across the Russian-Ukraine border.
The network produced a video landing at the airport of Ufa of a Jako-42 passenger plane, which went beyond the 400m runway and collapsed on the left wing.
The video was released by the TV channel "360".
It happened at 4.30 Moscow time.
The cruise from Krasavia arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, and there were no casualties.
The aircraft itself was transported to the parking lot.
Ufa airport operates normally.
The SDR ' s enquiries on transport have been investigated as to the reason for the rigid landing of a liner aircraft.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in the areas held by rebels in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but UN Special Envoy for Syria, Stephen de Mistura, sees this as an indisputable fact.
Such statements were made on the eve of the third round of inter-Syrian negotiations, which should begin at the end of August in Geneva.
UN specialists have initiated investigations into reports of chemical weapons being used in the Syrian town of Aleppo.
The first information on the toxic gas attack, allegedly chlorine, appeared on 2 August.
At that time, the opposition stated that in the area where the Russian transport helicopter was shot down on the previous day, the aircraft dropped the toxic bomb, but in Moscow the charges were called a quitter.
Later, the Russian Ministry of Defence accused the opposition group "Harakitet Nur al-Din al-Zinki".
Soon it became known that the bombs had two toxic gases.
This was confirmed by BBC as one of the victims.
"A few minutes later, I felt the smell of gas, the start of the eyes burning, the difficulty of breathing," quoted an eyewitness as saying.
At least 7 people died as a result of the attack, 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of toxic gas is confirmed by experts, action will be considered a war crime.
UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told journalists: “The evidence that this really happened is a lot”.
The inadmissibility of chlorine for military purposes is contained in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
Although all parties to the Syrian conflict denied the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of use of chlorine by the Syrian army against “moderate opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo complicates the fact that the shells of its regions are being fired daily, and terrorists are obstructing the removal of residents from the city.
According to Reuters, the UN expects Russia to establish a “humanitarian pause” in hostilities.
The current regime of the daily three-hour silence in the organization is considered “inadequate to help almost 2 million civilians trapped in the trap”.
Staffan de Mistura, a humanitarian adviser, Jan Egeland, said that a 48-hour ceasefire would be required to evacuate the sick and injured people from there every week.
“We have to send bulk cargo from a convoy of trucks in areas where roads are practically destroyed and those left are mined”, said Mr. Egeland. “But the Russian delegation has confirmed its readiness to sit with us at the negotiating table.”
Consultations in Geneva between representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a “humanitarian break” continue.
How Russia opened a "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing fight for Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia, on 11 August, announced a three-hour cessation of hostilities, which will operate on a daily basis starting on Thursday.
The creation of “humanitarian windows” is intended to provide conditions for the delivery of medicines, food and essentials to the city.
The decision of Minoborona RF was taken against the backdrop of the increasing international pressure on Moscow, requiring the cessation of the military operation and facilitating the resumption of the negotiation process.
Four people died as a result of a series of explosions in Thailand ' s resorts.
Several explosions immediately occurred in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
Four people died as a result of the attack, injured 19.
The explosion epicenter came to the town of Hua-Hin.
Ten foreigners, four nationals, were found to be victims, and there were no Russians.
The responsibility for the incident had not yet been taken by any terrorist group, but the Ministry of State has hurriedly declared that Islamists are not involved.
Several people have already been detained on suspicion of bombings.
According to preliminary data from the local police, the scope and characteristics of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the warlords.
The attacks took place on popular tourist resorts, including the Patong Beach in the Phuket area and the town of Hua-Hin, Trang and Surat-Tani.
After the military junta came to power in 2014, economic growth declined from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism remained one of the few emerging industries.
In 2016, 14 million people had already visited the country, 1.5 million more in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attacks have already been detained, reported by police officer Krisan Patanacharoen.
While it was early to talk about the objectives, he added, in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, “they are “sure that they are not related to international extremist groups”.
It's too early to draw conclusions, Mr Patanacharoen said.
But we do know that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, they are actually local diversions, and we are trying to identify those behind them.
The explosion occurred on the birthday of Queen Sykrit of Thailand.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy to be one of its main priorities, so the incident is likely to be directed against it.
According to statements by the General Sithicha Shrispacharoenrate, the bombs were detonated remotely at half an hour apart.
They were hidden inside trees on lively streets filled with tourists eating in restaurants.
One of the four victims is already known to have been a Thai girl selling street food.
The identity of the remaining victims is still unknown, but it is known that they are residents of four foreign States.
According to the Thai Royal Police, four Germans, three Dutch subjects, two Italian and Austrian nationals.
The Russians are not among the victims of the explosion, Rostourism Press Service reported.
Local experts also associate explosions with the 7 August referendum, which supported 61.4 per cent of the country ' s population with the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a constitutional commission appointed by the military junta.
The voters had to decide whether they supported a system in which the upper House of Parliament was fully appointed by the military and had a significant role to play in electing the Prime Minister of the country.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Recall that on 22 May 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the army commander of the country, Prayt Chan-Ocha.
This step, he said, was followed by an ongoing political crisis and a lack of progress in the negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military established the National Peace and Order Council, imposed curfews and censorship, set up protesters and the upper House of Parliament.
How Bangkok found itself in a state of emergency
The Government of Thailand led by Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat in January 2014 announced the establishment of a state of emergency in Bangkok and adjacent to the capital of the provinces.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
Like in Bangkok, two explosions went off.
In January 2014, two explosions occurred in the centre of Bangkok at the victory monument, where one of the main protests took place, which affected 28 people, five of which were in critical condition.
The explosions occurred on motorcycles.
The authorities strengthened security measures in the capital and drew military forces to protect demonstrators.
The development of conditions began in Sukh Loge.
As the "U" has become known, it is proposed that the Government agree on the draft terms of the auction on the gold fields of Suha Log, with two key restrictions being maintained.
It is proposed that companies where 25 per cent and more belong to foreigners should not be allowed to auction, and those applicants whose capital does not have a minimum of 25 per cent of the government.
The industry does not expect the Government to rewrite the conditions, noting that many players are not at risk of a complex and expensive project.
The auction could be announced in August and held in October.
The Ministry introduced to the Government a draft order and auction conditions for the largest unexploded gold minefield in Russia, Suha Log (Irkutsk Region, Reserves and Resources - 130 million ounces), two sources of "U" familiar with the situation.
The project was submitted on Wednesday night, one of them being clarified.
In Minsk, the "U" confirmed that the project had been submitted to the Government.
The representative of the coaching non-drugation of Vice-Prime Minister Alexander Chloponin said "U" that the project had not yet been received from the official's office.
“The auction may already be announced in August, immediately after the Government's order has been issued, and given the time limit for the collection of bids of potential participants (at least 45 days) the tender may take place in October”, they say in Minsk.
According to the "U" data, the project maintained two key requirements for potential participants as described in the option that was sent for agreement to the ministries and FOIVAM in July (e.g., the "U").
The first is the presence in the capital of applicants at least 25% of the municipality.
The second is the refusal of access to an auction for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 on innovation in strategic societies.
According to the two articles of the draft FZ, as already written by "U" on 2 August, companies whose beneficiaries (25% of the shares and above) are not tax residents of the RF or have dual citizenship may not be allowed to auction.
The Government has the authority to impose such restrictions, since Suhay Log refers to the nedramas of federal importance (a supply of more than 50 tons of gold).
In Minsk, the project “contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies” was confirmed, but they refused to comment on the details before the Government had ordered.
The demand for equity participation in the auction was raised by the Irkutsk region, said "U" in December 2015 in the Ministry of Nature and confirmed later by the Governor of the region Sergey Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Nature by his predecessor Sergey Eroshchenko, who had “an investment agreement with Rosteh”.
Whoever lobbied the restriction on the admission of aliens, the interlocutors "U" do not specify.
“But this is in the spirit of time: not to give control in Russia’s largest gold deposit against Western sanctions,” says interviewer "U" familiar with the preparation of the auction.
On 1 August, the head of the Ministry of Nature Sergey Donsky stated that foreigners could “go to the consortium” if they were drawn to them “as financial partners, technology partners”.
The "U" interlocutors believe it unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The main contender for Suhay Log in the industry is the consortium of the largest gold miner of the RF PAO "Polus", the subordinate son of Sulejman Kerimova Sayidu, and Rusteha.
As the "U" said, in July, partners created the SL Zloto SP, where Poles accounted for 51% of the share, in the "Roseha" structure, RT-GR - 49%.
In Rostěh, commentaries were rejected, in Poles stated "U" that they were “absolutely interested in this asset” and had all the necessary competences and resources for its development.
“But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be taken after the terms and conditions have been announced”, added to Poles.
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision on the RF government said sources "U".
The Russian GV Gold and the Canadian Kinross, who were developing assets in Chukotke, claimed the opportunity to participate in the development of the Dry Logo, whereas Polymetal and Nordgold, according to the "U", did not take an interest in the asset.
In December 2015, Sergey Kashuba, head of the Union of Gold Industryers, estimated the "U" investment in Suha Log in $2.5-4 billion.
Most potential applicants are not only intimidated by the level of investment but also by the complexity of the project: there is a need for serious exploration of stockpiles and technology of work with complex ores, explained the "U" interlocutors in industry.
In the pension market, the biggest M&A deal, "KIT Finance Pension Administrator", began the process of unifying the four supervised NPFs.
As a result, on the basis of Gazfand Pension Savings, NPF will be set up with savings of about 373 billion rubes.
On the launch of the procedure for the merger of the four pension funds - "KIT Finance", "Promagrofond", "Individual" and "Gazzand Pension Savings" - yesterday, the owner of the 100 per cent CI "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" fund reported.
“Reorganization is carried out in agreement with the CB, subject to the requirement that the terms of the contracts in force are not infringed”, said the company 's communication.
The merger is based on the Gazfand Pension Savings Database.
According to NPF CEO Oleg Białoshicki, the pooling of funds has achieved several objectives: to expand the geography of presence, to concentrate resources for development, to reduce costs, to replicate the best practices of each of the funds and to optimize corporate governance.
He said that the indicative deadline for the completion of consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of the NPF, Gazfand Pension Savings will become the largest player in the SWAP market.
According to 31 March, the pooled funds ' pension savings amounted to more than 373 billion rubles.
According to the accounts on the fund website, the owner's beneficiaries - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" - are now Anatolia Gavrilenko (with 65% of the supervised PSOs) and Gazfond NPF (35%).
However, the group's association itself launched many later competitors.
For example, the Stalfond, a supervised group of O1 NPF "The Future", took over earlier this year.
Currently, this combined NPF has joined the Uralsib and the Russian Standard.
“Unification into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to meet structural challenges”, notes NPF director Nikolai Sidorov.
Active work on the consolidation of funds has been under way since April in the Safmar Pension Group, the European PNF, Education and Science and the Regional Fund, to be part of the Safmar PNF until the end of this year.
In 2017, the Trust NPF will join them.
“Unification of funds will have an effect on enhanced risk control, operational processes and expenditures”, noted Safmar in the pension group.
The suspension in the pooling of funds, which was held by KIT Finance Pension Administrator, may be caused by a number of reasons, is indicated by experts.
Until recently, NPFs could not buy more than 40 per cent of the output of infrastructure bonds in which the group was actively located.
Following the amendment of the CB Regulation in March this year, there are no further restrictions on a number of issuers that meet the regulatory requirements.
If necessary, the entire issue can buy out one large game," says the director of the group of ratings of the financial institutions of ACRA Yuri Nogin.
Several top-15 NPF managers on assets have called separation of spheres of influence and, as a result, staff appointments in a single fund that had to be agreed upon by group owners.
Yesterday, Anatolia Gavrilenko was not available for comments.
Gazfond also did not respond to the request by the "U" in the NPF.
While the consolidation of funds is a labour-intensive and low-cost activity, this decision will be justified at a long distance.
According to the Director of the Pension Partner Advisory Company, Sergei Okolesnov, at Gazfunda Pension Savings, fewer outflows, accession will stabilize the base of the other funds of the group.
In doing so, there will be better experience of KIT Finance and PromogroFund in the construction of retail sales of SWAs, as well as the use of more modern PIAs.
The requirements of the CB for the processes and personnel of the NPF are constantly increasing, so it is not appropriate to duplicate the infrastructure of the four funds under a single investment policy, according to the Managing Director for Corporate Ratings of the “Expert RA” Pavel Mitrofanov.
“The effect of reducing overlapping functions will clearly distort the possible cost of unification”, notes Mr. Mitrofanov.
The cost of pooling the four funds of Sergei Okolesnov is estimated at between 30 and 50 million rubles.
“The budget for the maintenance of the four funds of this size is about 400 million rubes per year, when the medium-term consolidation of the budget is actually halved”, Mr. Okolesnov said.
The best dynesia movie, "Pit and his dragon," went to Russia's bike.
The beautiful species of New Zealand, the skilful dragon, the touchy tale, and country-style songs are enough to believe in old - fashioned magic again, according to ELENA KRAVZUN.
A frightened little boy was picked up by a dragon that became a human infant and a gentle nanny and a loyal friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, in honor of a puppy from the book of fairy tales, playing with him in a catch-up and falling asleep in a hug.
Six years later, he, who grew up in a well - watered chain, would no longer be like another imaginary forester, Maugli.
This is Pete's image, and she finds a red haired woman named Geyser Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while the gang of Gavin (Karl Urban), her husband's brother, is aggressively rocking the forest.
Now she's going to have to believe not only in the existence of a dragon but also help save it.
Pete's got an accelerated course on being human in the Indian American community that wears cowboy shirts, a moral code in the heart, and smiles more blind than any commercial.
No person looks and does not act too horrible to really start to hate or fear the viewer.
Even Gavin, who hunted the untypical inhabitants of the forest, is far from being the wrong villain.
A huge, puffy dragon has also not been feared, with a good bearded bulldog, an airline scale of wings and the ability to become invisible.
It's funny, it's snorkeling, it's even snorkeling, and fortunately it doesn't say, but it's always hungry, and it's better than all the famous cinematographic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manners ensure such a high degree of emotional involvement that at the most stressful times, they are desperate to sore in three hands not only by small viewers but also by adults.
Surprisingly good and young Oaks Figgles as Pete, breaking up between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford gives a virtuoso to a canon grandfather, who would be happy to have literally every child.
How did director David Lowry manage to download a fantasticly cute masterpiece of the forgotten Disney film "Dracon Pit" in 1977, the middle of the nose to the tip of the tail, remembered only by the mix of animation and play film, and make it the most mind-blowing film this summer?
Not unless a miracle worked.
In his painting, Lowrey from the original, in fact, took only two things, orphan Pete and the dragon.
There are still music numbers and most of the weird jokes left behind.
This good story reads the traits of Bambi, Inoplanetian and many other lovely hearts of children.
The Disney studio continues to be a well-developed gallery of high-quality craftsmen of the 21st century.
Of course, Pete and the Dragon aren't as charmingly beautiful as the Jungle Book, and there's no experienced villain Kate Blanchet as a stepmother in the new Cinderella.
But this naive film has also been a success in believing in miracles and good in the best traditions of Disney.
By the way, the keys to Disney Magic Castle will get the director Lowry again, for the art cinematization of the story of Peter Pane.
The tandem of David Lowry and screenwriter Toby Halbrucks have entered a new ambitious project on a non-adulterant boy based on James Barry's one-name story.
Journalist Alexandrou Sokolovu is presented with a new indictment
Lawyers of RBC journalist Aleksandr Sokolov, accused of organizing the extremist structure, stated that the prosecution had found fault with their defence.
We learned from the investigators just yesterday that the D.A. made this presentation.
We had been scheduled to participate in a court meeting on the limitation of the criminal record, but the meeting was not held, and the investigators informed us of the presentation made by the Public Prosecutor's Office,” said Olga Dinze, a lawyer.
She explained that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had indicated to the investigators that the case and the material collected had not been properly qualified.
The investigators will now have to remove the gaps in the evidentiary base and present a new indictment to Alexander Sokolova.
Either another article of the Penal Code (CQ) will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, is clarified by Ms. Dinze.
As reported by "U", Alexander Sokolov was arrested on 29 July 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded from the charge the journalist RBC from the language on “deploying the political situation towards instability” and “the overthrow of the authorities by an illegal means”.
ALEXANDR ZILLBERT lived the life of an Olympic in the Olympic village, inspected the house of the Russian assembly, ate at the local dining room, and even passed the WADA test afterwards.
I don't think life is going to die here for a second.
Even at night.
The last start is sometimes completed at midnight, after which athletes need another one and a half hours to return to the Olympic Village.
In addition, resettlement and eviction are being maintained without interruption, as some athletes finish their speeches and leave Brazil and some, on the contrary, only arrive here.
At 7:30 a.m., the heads of all Olympic delegations are dragging into one of the temporary tents.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational household issues, which is explained by the head of the sports delegation of the Olympic team of Russia, Igor Kazikov. - Although the house where ours were located is considered exemplary, he was put into operation as one of the first ones and demonstrated to all the examiners, even in this case, there are some misdemeanours.
It's a hot water problem, so I'm sorry, with toilets.
We fought for cleanliness for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the clinics came in, but they're only spraying some substance on the floor, that's all.
Their sexes, you see, are innovative.
Mol, you can't wash them humanely.
Well, we know these fields, they're laminate!
Anyway, we've got the clinking company's shifts, and now we're all good.
The Olympic village is South Boutovo, a dormitory area surrounded by mountains, and the other is an impressive roar, a watery place.
And for reliability, there's a two-metre-long railway fence along which automatics are passing.
The village can accommodate up to 17,000 people in 3604 apartments in 31 homes.
On one of the 18-storey buildings hangs a huge Russian flag - this house is fully dedicated to the needs of our assembly.
Looking at a small lobby at the entrance, you can immediately determine what problems the domestic team may be most pressing.
On the registration stand there are two announcements: "Please don't put the paper in the toilet!" and from "I'll take the badge."
The stand itself drowns in tracts.
Their festive bloom contrasts with the headlines of the brochures: “Memory of infectious diseases for Rio-de-Janeiro”, “First aid in drowning, foreign body in the airway, loss of consciousness - stages of cardiac resuscitation”, “First aid in burns, heat strikes, fractures and bleeding”.
Text inside is generally encouraging.
For example: “The infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent treatment.
However, there is a need for a favourable outcome.
Of course, there is a health centre in the Russian congregation, which at any time is ready to provide qualified assistance to residents of the home, including relaxing and sporting massages.
On the contrary, the Centre is the headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door is an inspiring poster, "Despite anything, we will win!"
And, of course, poems:
All the arguments are totally insane!
Only those who believe in them believe in them.
Let less of us, the sweetest taste of victory, Russia will not give up, it will not break!
And for an even greater increase of the spirit is the announcement: "Dear brothers and sisters!
After blessing the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all of Russia, Cyril's spiritual care for the athletes of the Olympic Assembly Russia is carried out by the protagonists Andrej Vladimirovich Alexeyeev.
You can order applications and other demands on the phone...
In general, there is a Centre for Meditation and Religious Circumstances for All confessions in the village.
Well, the Russians, they do, in a privileged position, have their own watch.
Because the elevator was loaded from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the stairs, which is recommended for use during the fire.
And in the darkness he stumbled upon the body lying on it.
Apparently, they were the sleeping workers of the new clinking company.
I think they're willing to throw themselves at the washing of innovative sex at any time and decide to set up a quiet time right on the cold feet.
On the fourth floor, I was waiting for a meeting with an old friend, Vitali Fedorovich Dubko, a coach of our Batutists, who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He kindly agreed to show his rooms to the teacher, the champion of Europe, Jana Pavlova.
It's not much to complain about, it's shared by the impressions of a well-deserved coach of Russia.
Sanwell's one on four, but it's spacious.
The locker, of course, is funny, from the fabric, it's not trustworthy, but things can be put down.
"No, you pretend they're out of tea." He's giving away the tennis player Svetlan Kuznetsov, whom I met in the main dining room.
Its main name is at least because it is 27,000 square metres and is ready to accept 5,000 visitors at the same time.
There are 60,000 servings on top of the house on a daily basis, absolutely free of charge.
The menu options are: “Brothers from Brazil”, “Peace cooks”, “Asian dishes” and “Peach, pasta products”.
The last option, as I looked out, is very popular with our volleyball players.
And let's just say I didn't find any soup in any of the units in the giant restaurant.
What kind of soup?
It's a good thing I took Chinese with me, welded.
And a teapot.
But in general, to understand, we have worse food on our ceilings.
There's something you can choose here, despite the unbearable uniformity.
I personally picked a fever for a couple and a freezer in a tomato sauce.
A three-language tablet, English, French and Portuguese, together with each dish, is located, indicating the food value of the product and the existence of allergens.
Well, I'll admit, it's been eaten.
I can't even figure out why that's the turn of the local McDonald's all the time.
Wet, relaxed, we could say hot athletes at the restaurant exit are waiting for our best friends - representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They cheat on the Victorian trap, the winner of which gets the T-shirt.
Prove it, you can say!
To get a gift, you have to answer at least eight of the ten questions correctly.
There's a question on the Russian!
But I didn't.
So I'm in a patriotic rush, of course.
The situation had worsened on the second question, "If I received a notification of the Doping Control, should I go to the Doping Control Point immediately?"
I stopped at option B, "No, I've got one hour."
Lost, so to speak, watchfulness.
I forgot that WADA did not have to wait.
Anyway, you need to show up right now.
Well, at the seventh stage, my situation became very critical.
I thought, for some reason, that if I find it difficult to keep a balanced diet because of my dense schedule (and I find it difficult to!), I can use bioadditions to get “additional nutrients to increase my productivity”.
Ann, no, no, no!
More specifically, the answer is formulated in such a way that it is not categorically prohibited, but strongly denied in several proposals.
Dishonestly plays this WADA!
- What's up, Russia?
There is nowhere to go beyond Efimov, Isinbaev, and all our defiled team.
That's why I've been focused, and I've won an unfortunate T-shirt.
Know, as they say, ours!
In a winning mood, I got into a gym in the neighborhood.
I'm in the middle of counting the trainers.
He's down at 250.
It was surprising to note that no Russian athlete had been found in this accumulation of treadmills.
But maybe it's the right thing to do?
Let the one who can't play train!
There's a guy in a polyclinic sitting next to us.
In line with the eyeballer.
Don't worry, don't shoot.
In a polyclinic, however, as in the entire village, wherever it spits, it hangs a condom maker.
And there was an encouraging call: "Praise with a condom."
The next thing you know, the iron that resembles the door lock handle and the condom made from the Amazon natural latex is ready to come out of the machine.
I took myself, to remember.
The athletes won't stop, they've brought them 450,000.
There is an entire entertainment center for the holiday and holiday time in the village of Olympia.
In addition to it, there is an educational chart that reminds us that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day in various ways on athletes.
The center is flooded with video games, billiards and tennis tables, table football and hockey, and some strange devices similar to video coaches.
What is this? - I'm interested in a comrade in the form of a Ukrainian collection that actively uses a wild toy.
I could, of course, just say that they don't want to talk to a man in the form of a common Russia, that's all.
Here, by the way, there's some kind of strange circumstance in the eyes of the rumbles of the boys in yellow and blue.
The most playing collection, it turns out.
It takes at least three hours to get around the entire village by looking into every corner of the village.
But if you're going to go to electric cars, you're going to get a house of a Canadian raccoon with a moose in front of the entrance and a bathroom and a ticket office, and a laundry, and a dry cleaning, and a hairdresser, and a flower shop, and a handbag with everyday goods, and a letter of unique brandy (only you can't wait your turn from Chinese philatelicists), and the bank, and the office of sightseeing, and photokiosque.
Later in the evening, you will sit by the olive tree, hung by a colorful ribbon, in memory of the friends and relatives of the athletes who have left the world.
And you're going to be under the accompaniment of a car that's messy with fluid to kill insects, to think of forever.
I mean, the Olympic movement.
Which in this village does not stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world was holding its breath, the Australians were almost under orders from the American Dream Team, the real fans went online.
Few people know: The news that Inna Deriglasova won gold in a rapier at the XXXI Olympics was the first to win.
Maybe I'm the only one who's ever seen this happen, not counting those, of course, who was watching the Carioca competition that night.
This can only be understood by a real diseaser.
Imagine a deaf Moscow night.
Neighbors below -- as always by night -- wake up and start to scream evilly at each other, but very loudly.
And threatening to move the furniture.
There's no time to go to the market in the kitchen, and buy it, like the plumber asked, a new one.
The TV schedule is not clear, so he just kept track of the Match, First and Rosia channels, though it's almost pointless.
"Russia" is a family of repeats, the entire sport there is somewhere in the records.
There are live broadcasts.
Hope, of course, for "Match" -- a young man screamed all night in news shows at first about the great semifinal of Deriglas-Shanaeva, then about the coming fight for gold.
It would be easy to show.
But instead basketball is the US-Australia.
I can't say anything wrong about this decision, by the way.
The Australians were equal, the first half won at all.
They put the cops in their place from the greatness of the Americans.
As a result, they have lost, but, as is now said to be, the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer be the case.
It's all good, but there's a fight with De French, and there's no change on the screen.
I'm starting to leave channels in a panic.
It feels like a second time in a row.
All right, let's go deep, cable.
There's no such thing as "The Mother" fencing.
Oh, I think the fight's about to begin.
I'm not comfortable with texting and tweeting some sports websites.
Road surfing yields an unexpected but brilliant result.
On the Web site "First", it turns out, there's a direct technical broadcast of all the competitions that take place at this time.
Calling for fencing, getting a gold unit.
Deriglas is an excellent counterattack, moving forward on the points, and clearly starting to pull the time.
Italian women play almost the whole hole.
Our one point ahead of us, just over two seconds to go.
Di Francesca's dropping on Deriglazu, and she's retreating, and time's running out, and the Italian girl's taking the shot.
Victory!
A few seconds later, the Olympic Massenger reports a fourth gold medal on the phone.
It comes out, I'm the first to see it with my own eyes.
Crazy, faithful, involved.
The Muslim Spiritual Authority (DUM) of Tatarstan refuses to use Russian in mosques.
Yesterday, the DUM prisoners obliged their imams to preach Friday's sermons only in Tatars to force young Tatars “to learn their own language”.
In management, it is stated that the right of Muslims of other nationalities is “not in any way infringed”.
In some mosques, Kazani mentions that the Tatar language does not understand up to 60 per cent of the inhabitants, including foreign students, migrants and the Tatars themselves.
Imams fear that their Tatar sermons will not go to the audience.
Yesterday, DUM Tatarstan unanimously decided to preach Friday’s sermons in the mosques of the Republic only in Tatar.
As Tatarstan Mufti Kamil Samigulin said, this should be an incentive for young Tatars “to learn their own language”.
"For those of you who say it's heavy, in every great mosque we intend to organize the lessons of Tatar language absolutely free," promised Mr. Samigulin.
He added that “the decision had already entered into force” and that in all mosques the sermon “must be in Tatar language”.
He recalled that Tatarstan's DUM was publishing a magazine called "Shurrah" with typical Tatar - language sermons.
Imam, who doesn't speak well in tarry, can be well prepared for them.
The Tatarstan DUM combines more than a thousand incomes in all municipalities of the Republic.
According to Mufti, Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in Tatar.
At the same time, a number of mosques used mainly Russian in Kazani.
In particular, as the mufti pointed out, this was practiced in the Burnaev Mosque, Zakabana and Eniler.
However, Mr. Muhametshin stressed, the leadership has set the task of ensuring that all students have both public languages of the Republic, regardless of nationality.
“No harm can be said to the Netatar Muslims”, said Mr. Muhametshin, explaining that the sermon itself “is not an obligatory, essential part of the mascara”.
At the same time, it will continue to be read in Arabic, and lectures and lessons in Russian will be preserved in mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Muhametshin said "U" that there was no serious threat of the withdrawal of Tatar language from mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatarsian other languages, for example, Uzbek or Tajik, according to him, are not used in the preaching work in the Republic.
The DUM decision was actively supported in the Executive Committee of the World Congress of Tatars (WCC).
Rinat Zakyrov, the head of the WT, said "U": "Menchti is an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the Tatar language had been removed from this area.
He noted that preaching only in Tatar language was “the desire of the imams themselves,” but in the FTC’s reply, “this is considered correct”.
The Imam interviewed, who preached in Russian, are ready to implement the DUM's decision, but they believe that there will be difficulties in the students ’ understanding of the clergy.
Tartars go to the mosque, and the Russians go to the mosque.
Many people don't understand the language.
Of course, they'll be saddened.
"I'm going to have to restructure," says the Burnaev Mosque Farhat Mavletdinov.
According to him, the Russian - language sermons are closer even to many Tatars, since “Russian, both in schools and in kindergartens, and all over the radio, originally.”
However, he believes that the mosques will be able to continue with the lessons and lectures in Russian, which are held in other days.
We rely on God.
God will show us how to get out of this situation." He concluded.
But about 60% of us don't know Tatar.
These are both Uzbeks and Tajiks and Azerbaijanis.
A lot of foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we've been in the Russian language for four years," I said.
He believes that in Tatar language the sermons will “get to a narrower circle and not reach the whole audience”.
But we will obey the decision of the prisoner.
It's just that the end of the sermon will be different.
But time will tell.
"For example, it will be easier for me, because the Tatar language is my mother tongue," concluded Gabdullah Galileo.
Former director of FSIIN court-martialed
Moscow's Prosecutor's Office approved an indictment of the criminal investigation of the GSO of the SDR on the theft of the budget allocated to Russia's FSIN.
There will be an ex-head of the prison department, Alexander Reimer and his deputy, who have caused more than 2.7 billion rubs to the court.
The Capital Prosecutor ' s Office sent a criminal case to the Zamskørecki Raid for the former director of the Russian Federation, Alexander Reymer, his former deputy, Nikola Krivolapov, as well as the Director of the FRIP, the Information Technology and Communications Centre of the Federal Prison Enforcement Service (FIUP), Victor Determinov.
Depending on the role and the degree of participation in crimes, they are charged by the GSS in Moscow under article 285(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (obligation of authority with severe consequences), art. 4, art. 159, art.
In addition, Krivolavov is charged under Art. 222 of the Criminal Code (unlawful acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the CSR, in 2010-2012 those persons were kidnapped by fraud from the State Treasury by the budget allocated by FSIIN to provide the department with electronic monitoring systems for supervised persons, so-called electronic bracelets.
In order to steal the budget, the group developed a scheme whereby the CITOS FRUP-controlled enterprise with which the relevant public contracts had been concluded produced control and oversight techniques, including electronic bracelets, and implemented at several times the price overstated.
Despite the lack of production equipment, buildings and facilities for the installation of production facilities to enable the completion of the “electronic bracelet” cycle between them and the Russian Federation FSIN, five goscontracts of more than 3.3 billion rubles were concluded.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion rubs were recorded in the accounts of the FRP Samar branch, of which 1.2 billion rubs were stolen.
As a result, more than 140 million rubs were personally paid to Mr. Reimer in his office by an accomplice whose criminal case was allocated to separate proceedings.
Nikolai Krivolavov, who participated in the machinations, found the unknown origin of the cartridge to a prize gun, allowing him to present an additional indictment.
In the present case, which amounted to 133 volumes, FSIIN applied to the accused for damages of 2.7 billion rubs.
Soccer Hakan Shukhur is suspected of being involved in the field.
The Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of a former football player and then a member of the parliament of Hakan Shukur and searched his family's two homes.
The Turkish football star of the 1990s, the early 2000s, the attacker Hakan Shukur, is being sought by the country's authorities for an attempt at a coup d'état last month.
Forvard, who graduated from a sports career in 2008, is accused of being part of a “armed terrorist group”.
It is the “Khismette” movement, a society associated with the well-known Turkish religious figure and opposition leader Fethullah Gulen.
It is his President Erdogan who considers the attempted military coup on 15 July to be the organizer.
Fethullah Gulen lives in the United States, and the Turkish authorities demand his extradition.
According to local media, a warrant for the arrest of Hakan Shukur has been issued today, and the police have already searched two homes belonging to the former footballer's family.
According to the investigation, his father was also involved in the organization of Fethullah Guilen in addition to Hakan Shukur himself.
However, neither a former football player nor his loved ones found themselves there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
In his life as a football player, Hakan Shukur defended the colours of several Turkish clubs and advocated a collecting country.
He spent most of his career in the Galatasarea.
The list of foreign clubs includes Italian "Torino", "Inter" and "Palermo", and Blackburn".
True, he did not spend more than one season in either of them.
Hakan Shukour remains the most effective target of Turkey: 112 matches for a national team and 51 beats.
In 2013, Hakan Shukour left his post because of an ongoing corruption investigation into the Ergogan Party and its immediate surroundings.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, at least 42 journalists were issued arrest warrants in Turkey on 25 July.
They are accused of facilitating military coups and ties with the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the United States.
Given the gravity of the charges, media officers can wait for long prison terms, ranging from 10 years to several life imprisonments.
Egor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas for domestic films only.
“I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinemas, which were worth 2-3 times less than for foreign films”, he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky notes that Russian films are difficult to compete for a viewer with large Hollywood bands.
We have more than 100 images per year, of which an average of 20-25 tapes reach the screens.
"And even they find it very difficult to compete with the Transformers and the Iron Man," the film director said.
To remind you, on 1 July, the All-Russian Youth Education Forum “Tavrida” began work in Crimea.
Among the participants are artists and young professionals from various creative and humanitarian fields from all over Russia and from a number of neighbouring and distant countries.

Uh, News - The new contractor promises to hand down Zenit Arena by December 26th.
The new contractor of the St. Petersburg Stadium, to host the 2010-17 Cup and the 2018 Football World Cup Championship, Metrostroy promises to give up the arena by December 26th, reports RIA Novosti, referring to the head of the temporary commission of the Federation Council for Preparation for the World Cup 2018 Vadim Tulipanova.
"We visited the construction with the Russian Minister of Sports Vitali Mutko this year, with us was Director of Metrostroy Vadim Alexandrov.
He said he'd give up the stadium by December 26th.
It's a serious Peterburg company, she never breaks time.
Vitali Mutko and I are happy to be seen and heard," quoted the interviewer's agency.
Vitaly Mutko had previously arrived in St. Petersburg to examine the venue for upcoming large-scale competitions.
Mr. Tulipanov also noted that his commission, Sowfeda, would continue to monitor the progress of the construction of the stadium and would visit the construction regularly.
To remind us, yesterday it became known that Metrostroy would complete the construction of Zenit-Arena, the value of the contract would be about 5.4 billion rubes. The same company won trades for the improvement of the territory around the stadium, the value of the contract was 2.4 billion rubes. Contracts with the AO Corporation Transstroy, OS Engineering Corporation Transstroy-SPb and AO Engineering Corporation were dissolved.
Two other companies were not allowed to fight for the construction of the stadium.
For more details on the selection of the new contractor, please read in "U" "Metrostroy" material on the field.
In Miass (Celabin Region), a lawyer was detained by former Deputy Governor Nikolay Sandakova Konstantin Akulić.
According to U-South Ural, another accused's lawyer, Sergey Kolosovsky, Constantine Akulic, has today called Miassa to the investigation department to press charges in the case of the annual statute of limitations on beatings.
Constantine Akulić then moved to the scene as a lawyer to assist one of his participants.
“It was originally initiated against unidentified persons, and as soon as he began defending Nikolai Sandakov, it turned out to be Akulić”, he said.
Constantine Akulić became a lawyer for the ex-Deputy Governor in early August.
At the same time, half an hour before the lawyer's call to the KSR, Miassa was notified to the defence party that Monday was due to be informed of the fraud case against Nikolay Sandakov.
Let's remind you that two criminal cases have been brought against Nikolai Sandakov.
As part of the first (the fraud case), he is incriminated by the promise of 1.5 million rubles to facilitate the appointment of Mayor Magnitogorsk to the head of the administration of Lake Eugenia Tarasov.
The second criminal case concerns bribes that Nikolai Sandakov allegedly received from the Director of the PWP “Piton” Igor Kalugin in the form of illegal gratis property services of at least 1.3 million rubles.
For more details on Mr Sandakov's case, read in "U" material, "former vice-governor requires the merger of your cases".
The Russian Media Company (RMC) stands ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that RFMOs have been engaged in modernizing one of the country's oldest and environmentally "polluter" enterprises, the Karabash Medical Cell.
The Karabash medical plant was founded by an English stock company headed by Leslie Urkwart in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was a major industrial enterprise for the economy, and it actually ensured the viability of the whole city.
However, in the 1990s, production was halted owing to financial problems, resulting in serious social problems in Karabash.
In 1998, it was decided to resume the work of the Karabash Medical Cell.
It was also necessary to address one of the main problems of the Karabash plant - the environmental one.
By the early 2000s, Karabash had been known sadly as an ecological disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the enterprise had become the management of the Russian copper company.
The company started to modernize production, which gradually reduced the environmental load on the environment.
This was also noted recently by Governor of Chelabin Region Boris Dubrovsky, who visited the first numbers of the Carabashmedi in July.
The head of the South Ural named the tremendous changes that have taken place with the enterprise since Carabashmedi moved to the RMC group.
The main event to modernize Karabashmedi in recent years has been the construction of a new sero-acid system that captures up to 99.9% of steel gases.
According to the President of the Russian copper company Vývloda Levin, investments in the project amounted to some 7 billion rubles.
The next stage of the upgrade of the carabashmedium ZAO is the reconstruction of the converter transfer.
The replacement of three converters, dispensers, gas pipelines is planned at the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion rubles.
In addition, a new 1 billion rubble treatment process is planned to be launched at the end of 2016.
In turn, the amount of taxes to be paid to the city of Karabash will also increase.
Over the entire duration of the project of the Tominsky GOC, from the start of construction to the start of operation of the second round, the federal execution will receive 8.9 billion rubes.
After GOC was put into operation, taxes could amount to 80.9 billion rubes.
For the year of production, the various levels of budgeting in the Varna region have been allocated 346.3 million rubes.
And that's in the first year.
"The longer the enterprise works, the more the contributions may be," said Valery Ulanovski.
In the RIC, tax returns from the Miheiev GOC were estimated to be 1 billion rubes in 2015.
However, the participation of RIC enterprises in the life and development of their territories is not limited to tax deductions.
RIC enterprises are helping to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, cultural and recreational facilities, and to make the territory a better place to live.
In 2016 one of the largest social projects of the Russian copper company in Karabash became a major repair and, in fact, a nearly complete restructuring of the N9 kindergarten for 95 pupils.
The building, built in 1960, was in an emergency condition.
Also in the territory of the Arena, there is a landscape park with artificial sheets, underground and ground parking spaces for 600 machine shops, cafes and sports shops.
The Arena's RIC will provide a visible professional sport event at the international level.
But the main objective of the project is to make exercise in fitness and sports comfortable for the inhabitants of Chelabinska, especially for children.

The members of the Sandholm Refugee Centre in Denmark suspected that the adolescents living there were engaged in prostitution.
On Thursday, August 11, The Local reported it.
According to him, some youths told the agency that “some people in Copenhagen are organizing prostitution activities”.
According to the publication, doubts arose from the Swedish newspaper Sydsvenkan about similar stories in Malmé.
In 2015, the crisis broke out in the European Union due to the influx of refugees from Africa and the Middle East.
Denmark has located more than 20,000 of them in its territory.

WSJ: The United States is considering sanctions against the RF because of the burglary of democratic servers.
Officials of the United States are considering introducing new sanctions against Russia in response to the failure of the servers of the Democratic Party, writes The Wall Street Journal with reference to sources.
To impose sanctions, the U.S. President Baraka Obama administration is reportedly required to formally charge Russian servers or hackers supported by the Russian authorities.
According to sources, the FBI and other U.S. special forces are almost convinced of Russia's involvement in cyberattack.
WSJ notes that the United States usually prefers not to name those who engage in hacking attacks.
The exception is the hacking into Sony Entertainment Pictures database, which was officially assigned to the DPRK in 2014.
However, last year Obama issued a decree simplifying the imposition of sanctions on those who carry out or assist cyber-attacks.
It was originally directed against China, but could also be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions may be lengthy, the publication writes.
Even if officials had concluded that hackers had acted with the support of Russia, before deciding to disclose information, they would have to assess the possible consequences.
They have to determine whether the incident is too serious to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
It was previously reported that Barack Obama ' s administration allowed sanctions to be imposed against a State whose hackers had been hacked by the servers of the Democratic Party's Nazi party.
WikiLeaks published an electronic correspondence from the National Democratic Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities could be involved in burglary.
In the Kremlin, such reports were considered absurd.
FAS fined Google for nearly half a billion roubles
The reason was a breach of competition in the mobile application market.
The antimonopoly proceedings were initiated at the initiative of the Yandexa.
The Russian company claimed that Google provided smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components under conditions that prohibited the prescribing of applications from other developers, in particular from Yandexa.
FAS found evidence of these claims and found that the company abused the dominant position in the market and imposed the installation of mobile devices with Google Play's other applications.
Following a review, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google, informing FAS leader Alexey Docenko.
The penalty shall be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
In FAS, it was concluded that competition law should be respected by all companies, including transnational corporations.
In turn, Google intends to study the solution first, and only then will it be determined with further action: to perform it or to challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service recognized the company as a breach of the competition law in September last year and ordered the treaty to be adjusted until 18 December.
However, Google did not agree to this.
Since then, the company and the department have been conducting judicial proceedings.
The FAS noted that despite the fine, they were discussing with Google the possibility of concluding a world agreement.
This will not lead to anything.
Such an opinion was expressed by the leading analyst, Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazin also noted that the fine would not affect the users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

The Anime effect of Snapchat is criticized as a cartoon of Asians
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say that it is racially untouchable.
Using the Linza Snapchat tool, it allows about 150 million users a day to change the validity and to play with the individuality of ways that borders on absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character to paint Roy Liechtenstein.
Lins are rough, distorting instruments that create more than 30 million adjusted self-sails a day.
Any mistakes quickly become public knowledge.
Linsy Snapchat was criticized in the past when they were accused of promoting dark skins of the person or encouraging bleached persons as the ideal of beauty.
So when some users were offered a lens this week, which gave them hairy eyes, crooked teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics found it racist cartoons on Asians, "Jelts".
And they wondered whether these recurring contradictions pointed to the more serious problem of the company related to diversity.
The following day, after Snapchat stated that they had removed the function, reports were circulated on Wednesday, followed by an outrage at The Verge and Motherboard.
The company commented: the lens was designed as a respect for the characters of the anime, not as a cartoon of Asians.
But experts who are not aware of racism are reminded of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others have completely rejected the comparison with the anime.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets about photographs were actively shared, said that the lens was “indignant and at least embarrassing”.
She added that "it was difficult to argue side by side with very rough cartoons on Asians and filter effects.
This shows that the filter, not just geltolithics, but highly obliteratingly geltolithics.
Snapchat is not the only company through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, ranging from corporate conference rooms to Hollywood and the deweiss that we all carry with us.
And the vast audience of young people in Snapchat, who are more racially diverse than their older generation, can mean that they are more likely to wait for understanding.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image offensive to the user, then, in an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Jo, “the course of events is much more difficult to remain undetected than before”.
On Thursday, Jo, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete her records at Snapchat and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believed that racial contradictions were the cause of insufficient diversity in the recruitment of staff in Snapchat.
The company's mostly criticized the white leadership, consisting only of men and finished its article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
According to Jo, who is an American of Chinese origin: “They have not had enough non-white people in the state to make such decisions, or are employed by non-white people, but they do not have such positions that can be safely and openly spoken.”
Other observers share her view, expressing discontent that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, underlining its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origins of its staff, but according to the trustee, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on the underrepresented population and on active attempts to attract domestic resources.
Jo said, for her part, that she would keep her record record in Snapchat closed, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to be able to say it won't go that way."
Military leadership has distorted ISIS intelligence, Congressional Commission reports.
Officials from the U.S. Armed Forces Central Command have modified intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the ground-breaking developments have revealed in the report issued on Thursday.
The interim report of the operational group, established by the Republican chairpersons of the Committee of the Chamber of Representatives for the Air Force, the Intelligence Committee and the Military Allocation Subcommittee, found “widespread dissatisfaction” among the Central Command Intelligence Analysts, who claimed that the leaders had supported their assessments of American actions aimed at defeating the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centauri, is the main military office in Tampa, Florida, which oversees United States military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The intelligence documents approved by the Centre’s supreme command tended to give a more optimistic picture of U.S. acts of terrorism than are confirmed by actual data from the scene, and have been more optimistic than the analysis provided by other special services”, said the news report.
"What happened in Centcoma is unacceptable: when the Supreme Leader is subjected to misrepresentation, our military is suffering," said a member of the House of Representatives, Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
The problems of leadership in the Centrum are at the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report deals in detail with the shortcomings consistently arising in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American actions aimed at training the Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
Although it does not contain definitive evidence that Obama ' s management was ordered to falsify the reports, he argues that analysts felt that the Centre ' s leadership forced them to give them a more optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimonies of the Central Command in Congress were far more optimistic than actual developments”, the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this is certainly known," said a member of the House of Representatives, Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top leadership of the U.S. Central Command Intelligence Service has forged command intelligence documents to reduce the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans established an operational group when they learned that analysts were concerned that the intelligence of the Islamic State had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, the report published on Thursday will be followed by more sophisticated data.
An additional, outstanding investigation by the Centres is being conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
The representatives of the Democratic Party in the Intelligence Committee of the US Congress House published on Thursday their own data, which is consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Operations Group.
“In 2014 and 2015, the Centre established an excessively closed procedure for the production of intelligence assessments concerning IGIL and Iraq’s security forces”, said a member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, the main representative of the democratic party in the committee.
This procedure, according to Schiff, “prohibited the issuance of intelligence documents”, has damaged the moral status of analysts and “has not adequately reflected divergent views”.
But Schiff and the Democrats claim that they did not find any evidence that the White House was trying to force Centcom's analysts to catch up with their conclusions under “a specific or political interpretation”.
Preliminary results of the Congress investigation were presented on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Chief Inspector of the Pentagon, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, representative of the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress's report while the Chief Inspector's investigation was continuing.
But he said that “experts sometimes differ in the interpretation of comprehensive data, and the specialized services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital subjects of national security”.
The consequences of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the targets of the American bombing in Iraq and Syria (as the Ministry of Defence now approves).
But last year's statements cast doubt on whether President Obama could rely on the Central Command to provide true assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Criticism on the Islamic State repeats the disputes that occurred more than ten years ago, when Centomo's intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article stating that the administration of President George Walker Bush, because of a protest by many analysts, expressed support for a small number of troops in Iraq and did not think of what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest caused by the intelligence of the Islamic State.
Last year, according to officials, Hucker's team concluded that despite public statements on the contrary, oil tankers belonging to the Islamic State did not significantly worsen the financial situation of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil in the black market.
But the discovery was not distributed outside the Central Command, according to the Times newspaper in September.
The then Centcoma commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year following testimony in the Senate, which many MPs felt was overly optimistic about the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The US beats 4 consecutive times in a women's hockey game on grass, bringing it closer to a crucial match with Britain.
Once beaten three goals in the match, which ended with a 6-1 victory over Japan, Kathy Bam opened the account Thursday for the first two goals for the U.S. women's hockey team on the grass when the Americans won a 3-0 win over India's team.
Five heads in two games must be a memorable achievement, but Bam, who is 27 years old, says she is not sure if she would ever do something like that.
"I'm not going to put the mind in," she said.
I'm not really the kind of people who track their goals.
This is what she knows: the account of the 4-0 Americans in the Olympics tournament, and they compete for the first place in their group with Britain, which remains unbeatable after Japan lost the 2-0 on Thursday.
The British and US teams will meet on Saturday at the last round of the first round.
Both teams claim to be fourth-final, and the result of the game will determine who will take first place in their six-teacher group and who will take the second.
The winner will avoid meeting with a strong team of rivals from Holland, leaders of another group, a little weather when the quarter-finals begin.
However, Saturday's game shows that the Americans here made noise with their unexpected series four years after they took the last place among 12 teams in London's games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time took a hockey stick on the grass when she was 3 (her older twin sisters played this kind of sport at Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16 and became her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she did not go on the final stage.
Then came 2012, when she and her teammates didn't get along.
The following year, Koig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed a coach, and everything started to change.
“Cultural change, psychological change, change in physical training”, Bam said.
In London, we didn't have the kind of productivity that we have right now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday night, Bam opened a check in the first half of the game with a bumpy hand at short notice.
India went to the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself to be surprised by the toughness and kept account 1-0 until the end of the third period when Bam took the initiative.
It took a long passage with the ball down the left side of the field, then spiraled into the middle and sent the ball into the gate sharply, thereby giving the Americans an advantage of 2-0.
Melissa González added a final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The "dry" victory was the first in the U.S. goalkeeper Jacky Briggs tournament to score one goal in each of the first three victories.
She's in shock.
So is Bam.
"We are in a good position right now," said Parnham, but how good it depends on the result of the Saturday game.
In the midst of the inviolability of the Olympic Games - Day Jumpers on Batut
Wherever you are, no matter how much time you have, it's the Olympics.
Events in Rio appear to be constant and inevitable, a strong combination of competition and ambition.
It's like an Olympic fire and there's a burning torch coming from the archer to the float, to the gymnast, to the triathlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the paper, or listen to your neighbors talking in the coffee shop and not hear about Simone Byles, Katie Ledeki or the hostility between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clo.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who first participated in the Olympics, was a beauty with its cheeks on its cheeks, could well be among the celebrities that are shown in the premium times promoted by sponsors and life-providing commercials if he were a swimmer, a gymnast, or even a fetishist.
But 28-year-old Dooley from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in an Olympic jump competition.
The Olympic Fire does not give the same light to all events.
Farther from the centre, partly in the shadows, are sports that are not generally recognized: gunfire, bow shooting, badminton, theekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, his long reign.
But if I'm allowed to do a hard job defending my personal passion, let me draw your attention to the modest charm of the bolts.
Although the jumps on the Batut are an Olympic sport since 2000, when they debuted at the Sydney Games, over the past 16 years they have received so little recognition that many of the people I interviewed have not been aware that they are in general Olympic sports.
This could be a regional ignorance.
Although the United States and the athletes were sent to the competitions, they never won medals in the jumps on the beat, and their athletes did not go to the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russian usually share male awards and Chinese and Canadian women.
Dun Dunn from China and Rosie McLennan from Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But the jumps on the trampoline have a charm of the outsider, especially because the uneducated ear is more associated with a circus college than with the Olympics.
I have to admit here that I'm not an expert, I'm just a ground-based enthusiast.
Indeed, they have a comic potential — a cartoon of endless jumps — but also gymnastics and leaps into the water, two kinds of sports that they generally combine.
The word "batut" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolín" meaning "drummer in water".
The contestants are about 30 feet in the air jumping to the giant Batut and have to perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, bends and staltos) before they finally land on their feet.
They are evaluated for performance, complexity and time flight, according to the official Olympics programme.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.
The most widespread Olympic course ever.
The applicants for the medal must go further, faster, higher and higher in the pursuit of gold, sometimes towards the finish line, and sometimes back and forth, down and down the field.
They seek not only a finish line or a starting wall, but also a television camera, another annoying abroad: a world or an Olympic record.
This persistent desire is noble, praiseworthy, even fanatical — and is enough to make even a viewer slip through.
But I think it's getting a little tired when you look at the game.
He's the one who gets the jumps on the trampoline.
Batutist's direction is up.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she jumps, he seems unconscious, like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
And, of course, they do not go without competition or difficulty, but throughout the program there is no crazy zeal for the finish, no jumps in the long, just a strange, exquisite waste of time and gravity.
It's the best Olympic sport in the world.
Women's qualifying competitions and then the finals will be held on Friday afternoon, the east European hour broadcasts, the men's Saturdays, also at the hour.
The NBC will broadcast the finals of the daily programme from 2 p.m. to 2 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic mix, a calm, beautiful moment is expected, which can easily be seen in a common dump.
And if there's only a rise in consciousness by putting male athletes in front of their eyes and targets, as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested by a United States gymnast, "Dooley's only waiting for his newly admired group of fans.
"The Generation Protests" in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators requiring political change in Ethiopia faced a fierce opposition from the Government.
Eyewitnesses say dozens of protesters were shot dead during clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of breakup?
Over the past decade, she has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months anti-government protests have shaken the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have gone out to the streets demanding radical political changes.
According to human rights defenders, the Government ' s reaction was brutal.
The witnesses claimed that dozens of unarmed demonstrators had been shot by police officers.
Video recordings from the protest sites allegedly taken at the end of last year or early this year show how security officers beat young people with sticks when they put them on the wall.
The United Nations High Officer for Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country from falling apart, and it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Horn project in the international crisis research group.
Ethiopia is the second populous country in Africa since Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and intelligence services cooperate closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is developing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved considerably — even a new suburban train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And her streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Ethiopia, however, was hardly a model of democracy — human rights organizations are constantly referring to governmental repressions -- the opposition in the territory of the State had crossed by the fact that the dissidents had actually been silenced.
Many of them were exiled, imprisoned, killed or exiled into remote deserts.
But that might change.
“If people are constantly suppressed and left with no alternative but to protest, there is a rebellion”, said Seyum Tashome, a lecturer at the university in central Ethiopia.
All young people protest.
The generation is protesting.
Many complaints, starting with land use, end up taking over the government coalition.
Following the widely criticised elections last year, the government party and its allies completely overpowered the opposition and now control 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are increasing; the struggle for this uncertain, controversial border took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to use unrest and disarm.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, which have been boiling deep for some years, are now emerging.
The first, it seems, is completely harmless: smartphones.
Over the past couple of years alone, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social networks, as cheap smartphones have become commonplace and Internet services have become better.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people still find it possible to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this was how they were organized to protest.
The second is that there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhar, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Throughout the centuries, Amharah, mainly the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of which are Muslims and live in low-lying areas.
But it's changing, too.
"We will work together at the same time," said Mulata Gemech, leader Oromo.
Major protests took place in the Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unjustly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population, which controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of concern is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, until his death from unknown illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could foresee danger.
Analysts argue that he was particularly experienced in identifying the first signs of discontent and using intelligence to obtain data and remove opponents.
"The current regime lacks common sense," said Abdi, an analyst for conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Heilamariam Desalen, appeared out of nowhere and took the place of Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was born from the Tigrai region in northern Ethiopia, Heilemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say he doesn't have the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tiger.
Many fear that this will result in even more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest in 2005, after thousands of people protested what the analysts said seemed to be elections that the Government had slowed down and then failed.
In the ensuing repressions, many Protestants were killed, although in less than the last months, and this period of unrest has passed relatively quickly.
Development experts expressed their appreciation to Ethiopia ' s leaders for the far-sighted development of infrastructure, such as the new inter-urban train and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But it is obvious that this did not stop the increase in internal discontent with the Ethiopian Government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protestors in Honduras, a city in Amhar, attacked enterprises belonging to Tigray, and anti-Tigrian hatred in social networks became comprehensive.
Analysts claim that protestors put the United States and other Western allies at a disadvantage.
The American Government had used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighbouring Somalia, although it had recently declared that the base had closed.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose power in an already fragile region.
"And it's going to be hard to get through," said Abdi.
Donald Trump explains his statement that IGIL was founded by Obama, "Scarcasm."
Donald J. Trump tried to close the last conflict that covered his election headquarters on Friday, claiming that he was joking when he claimed several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the founders of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The clarification raised new questions about the ability of the presidential candidate from the Republican party to address the American people in a prudent manner.
It also put his deputies, who tried to protect him during the period of unrest, into a awkward situation, because they had to explain words that he probably did not mean.
After expressing this suggestion at the convention on Wednesday evening, Trump strongly insisted on his Thursday approval, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that President and Clinton had founded ISIS.
But in a Twitter post early Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just passing away.
This post was the direct opposite of a statement made just a day earlier when Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When Radio Conservator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trampa ease the speech, reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, a candidate for president from the Republican party did not take advantage of the opportunity.
The last scandal was shattered when Trump tried to reorient his campaign into the economy in the light of a fall in ratings.
Trump and Clinton made competing speeches on the Michigan economy this week.
On Friday, Trump tried again to get back to the subject.
Once again, using Twitter, he warned that Clinton's plans would lead to tax increases, and said that he felt her speech was boring.
Trump used sarcasm as an excuse before.
At the end of July, after he had been subjected to general criticism, he had practically suggested that the Russians should break Clinton's e-mail, and later he explained his comments, saying, "Surely, I'm kidding."
Such an approach allows the Trumpet to go beyond what is acceptable in political speech and to take back what is necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing some of the messages that he's responding to among his worshipers to watch how they work and then to "explain" them in one way or another, depending on the response," said Ruth Sherman, an expert on communication, who analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful about his speech and knows that they're vague enough to treat them differently.
Instead of softening the words for the general electorate, Trump took an even more ominous tone in the last days, while his rating continues to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist rating, released on Friday, showed that Trump is leaving Clinton with a large overhang in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and is taking its toll in Florida.
Although Trump usually tries not to apologize for provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpretation of his words and misunderstanding of his sense of humor.
But since Trump has become the focus of the presidential campaign in recent months, his jokes have put his faithful allies in a awkward position: they have to publicly support him, however provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolf W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, who is one of the best-known deputys of Trump, made a serious effort to protect the candidate for an interview, CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he says is an acceptable political comment," said Juliani, when asked about the credibility of the Thromp claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It's true that before Obama IGIL was an almost unknown tiny organization, he called it a threat that was totally unfair, and that's why it happened because he brought the troops out of Iraq.
Most of the Middle Statistics Republicans believe that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, has allowed ISIS to develop because it has failed to deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to a rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the media for emboldening his every word and prejudice against him.
He mocked the "poor" television professionals who tried to solve it, and said, "They are weak."
Some Democrats have ridiculed Trump's excuses as a mere confirmation that he's not fit for presidents.
Once a deranged coffeehouse returns to Greenpoint.
Werb's coffee was broken, only in cash in Williamsburg, where there was no Wi-Fi, but a good coffee was served for 15 years.
Of course, she's out of her room with a shot at Bedford Avenue.
Soup Sherry, which took the place of Werb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
The locals mourned her as the last loss in the city that was restored.
Molly Crabapple's artist wrote on Twitter: "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea's hotel is destroyed, and Werb is now a soap shop."
But even though New York is constantly changing, it is being updated in turn.
Werb reopened last November at Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verbe has Wi-Fi and takes credit cards, but there are some of the same staff and a similar simple atmosphere.
Plus, coffee's still good.
Sisko Rodriguez, an old coffeemaker who is the owner and general manager of the new place, is at the head of the new Verba.
He started working at Verba in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered to offer him a new place, he said he would be happy to go.
Rodríguez, 36 years old, left much behind.
Werb works with the same bagel distributor and bought the same coffee machine.
It's even installed mirrors from the old Verba.
But Rodriguez said he'd also like to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
The menu features bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches and is available from capers or roasted onions.
There's a brownish dish.
There's no beer in the coffee shop, but they're making fresh-cut juices now.
Nine months later, Rodríguez said that he drew attention to the steady flow of old permanent clients.
"Many former clients were also issued with prices from Williamsberg," he said.
In one recent resurrection, Rebecca Oliveira was one of such clients.
Oliveira, 34 years old, had lived in Williamsberg and had frequent visits to Werb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she went there anyway.
After Verba closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that it was the coffee and the atmosphere that impressed me in Verba," she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, although that day instead of regular ice-coffee, she ordered a stuffed tea, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime client, has been loyally visiting Werb since 2003.
He went to work and ordered the same things.
"In fifteen minutes of the eighth, every day, like an hour, I came, and my bagel was prepared for me with butter and all sorts of dishes," he said.
Rodríguez said that he wanted to experiment and put new dishes in the menu.
Now, Rosenthal's still making a routine order, but he's ever changed something with bacon, eggs, or cheese on a bagel with all the sledgehammers.
Rodríguez said he wasn't offended that the soap shop had once taken over the old place.
Moreover, the Soup Sherry owners offered to make a special soap for Verba using coffee made in a cold way as an ingredient.
"I think we may agree to their offer," Rodríguez said.
The permanent residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin also loved the coffee.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodríguez said he planned to find a place for him on the window to make his new neighbors feel wanted.
There are other benefits to the new place.
The local juice point plans to spill on bottles and sell coffee prepared in a cold way.
There is a possibility that the coffee house will join the next building.
For many customers, it is sufficient that the new Verb will include their favorite dishes in the menu.
Joseph Whit was a regular client and shared that he was killed in grief when they closed down.
When the coffee shop opened in a new place, Whitt said that when he entered and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt as if he had returned home.
"How long have I wanted to feel this scent," he admitted.
Depressive meal of depression in Pulmonary Table
In March 1933, shortly after his office as President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt settled for lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved the fashionable dishes of Fifth Avenue, for example, the Fua Game and the Mereland turtle soup.
His menu on that day was more modest: the fermented eggs in tomato sauce, the mashed potatoes, and the pepper pudding on the dessert.
"This was an act of culinary solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Siegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, said, "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
Spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are experts in the history of food.
Cowe's latest book, "Rago in Chinese", was dedicated to the Chinese cuisine in America, and Siegelman told the story of life in a shared apartment in Lower East Side through food in her book "Home 97 on the Street of Fruit Garden".
Their new joint work, “Plot Table”, to be published on Tuesday by Harper, is the history of American food in the Great Depression.
Their own culinary solidarity to some extent, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny snack shop in the Fletish Quarter, which has been in operation since 1929, the year of the Birch crash.
Siegelman, 54, ordered a plum cheese and a sandwich with olives, and Coe, 57, took a turkey, potato mashed potatoes, and a vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered a meat roulette, the couple considered this a suitable starting point for the discussion of eating in the Depression era.
"The roulettes used great demand," said Siegelman.
There was an peanut roulette, a liver roulette, a bean roll.
They were made of basic ingredients and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to be removed.
Imagine that you ate as much peanut as you need for dinner.
Who's getting sick.
"He must have been lying in his stomach with a stone," he said.
In the years leading to depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Women's groups prepared for male farm workers, and a freshly baked cake was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during World War I that described the country’s ability to cope with the fact that it was suddenly no longer a country of abundance.
"It was the time when food became a central, difficult topic for Americans," said Coe, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budget diet was equally difficult: mysterious dishes, such as roulettes and toasts, became the main food; the sealing is a “excellent way to clean up the lunches”, Zigelman observed, because the cook could hide the non-peptic ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which has been the foundation of American food for many years, has been an economically distributed luxury.
People tried strange mixtures because the energy and nutritional value became more important than the taste and even the culinary common sense.
In research into a book that includes recipes, Siegelman prepared a dish of that age: a baked onion, which is rich in peanut butter.
"This addition to the lunch table was not a success," said Coe.
Siegelman added, "That was very strange."
Peanut oil doesn't fit the roasted onions at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
More than ever since then, household specialists — including Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Bureau of Household from 1923 to 1943 — have ruled the country’s eating habits.
When they published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become “budgetaries”, to accept the challenge and transform the burgundy like washed spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
The “flesh table” is the folly of curious historical facts.
Especially spicy stories about the government's reaction to starving citizens, such as President Gerbert Guver's position in the spirit of "let the pies go."
Publicly transporting the simple farm plot of Iowa’s state at the time of his childhood, he fed as a refined millionaire to whom he had become.
“He liked the continental cuisine, for example, the cucumber-fed fish, ” Koi said.
He ate practically in a gilded dining room wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantastically detached from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't told him to set an example with her own stomach.
According to the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired an economy that was completely not interested in taste, and this led to the White House “using not only the most depraved food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgustingly prepared”.
Many of the culinary receptions of the Depression era were forgotten as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Their heritage is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Zigelman says, and how science has been used in cooking.
Husbands tell us that at the time they wrote the book, they were better able to understand the eating habits of Zigelman’s mother — that she could not throw out food, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of the negligent relationship with the food," said Coe.
Siegelman says, "She has poisoned people on a complete scale."
There was this unfortunate case with the profits.
When the dishes at Eisenberg's were deserted, they and Koe got dessert, which they made at home: the black dessert that President Roosevelt had for dinner.
"It's called blackberry muss," said Siegelman, adding that it was a popular reception -- to give humble recipes the bronze names.
There were no plums, just blacks, a little flour, sugar, water, and crust.
Everyone was reluctant to put the spoon in a narrow, brown, sticky substance.
I'm surprised it wasn't bad.
On two occasions, he asked for supplements.
He said to his wife, "A little ragged walnuts would not interfere with this."
Arrest of figures on the massacre in the Jovan cemetery extended until 14 November
The Preznenski court left the figures in the case of mass fighting at the Jovan cemetery under arrest by 14 November, satisfying the request for an investigation.
In the case, 14 persons are accused.
Recall that on 14 May, several hundred Middle Asian and Northern Caucasus soldiers were beaten in the Hovansk cemetery, killing three people.
The former head of the cemetery, Yuri Chabuev and the lawyer, the co-founder of the Public Health Nation organization, Alexander Bocharnikov, are charged with organizing a murder.
The second issue for 2016 could be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was reported on 12 August by the Vice-President of the Government, Olga Gladets, during a visit to the Brian Region.
We have specific parameters to increase pensions in order to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations have been made.
The economists are now failing their half-years, and we will complete this work within the next two to three weeks," quotes the Interfax Gladiator.
Commenting on the proposed chapter of the Centre for Strategic Development by Alexei Kudrým, a six-month pension scheme, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the topic was not considered in the Cabinet.
At the end of July, it became known that the Government had agreed on a position on the full indexation of pension payments in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigoryan went to the finals of a small-calibre rifle shooting competition.
Russian athletes Sergey Kamensky and Kirill Grigoryan attended a small-calibre shooting competition in Brazil.
According to TSA, Sergei Kamensky scored 629 points and took first place was a new Olympic record in his qualifications.
Cyril Grigoryan became second, 628.9 years old.
Eight of the best athletes went to the finals.
Kamensky is the world record holder in this discipline (633).
Turkey's opposition to Fethullah Gulen requires international investigation into the circumstances of an attempted coup d'état in Turkey.
“I demand that the independent international commission investigate the attempted coup d'état,” quotes Guilenna, French newspaper Le Monde.
Also, the Turkish opposition officer stated that “if any part of the charges were confirmed, I would return to Turkey”.
Gülen, however, denies involvement in the coup d ' état, stressing that his organization has never claimed political power.
The Istanbul court had previously detained the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Guilen in absentia.
Recall that the military coup attempt took place in Turkey on the night of 15-16 July.
Gilead companies reimburse the costs of legal services during the dispute over hepatitis C patent with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to receive reimbursement of the costs of legal services it incurred in connection with the claim of a hepatitis C patent with Merck & Co Inc medication manufacturer, the federal district judge ruled.
In June, Gilead was released $200 million in damages for the violation of the two Merck patents relating to the medicines of Gilead, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the American judge found a number of violations by Merck, including by oath and other unethical acts.
On Thursday, Judge Beth Labson Freeman of the U.S. District Court said that Gilead was entitled to reimbursement of expenses incurred during the challenge.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to laboratory work based on the sofosbuvir, an active ingredient of Gilead medicines.
Armed forces established with the support of the United States claim to have seized full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
The U.S.-supported armed forces seized full control of the northern town of Manbij near the Turkish border, after the last soldiers of the Islamic State left the city, a representative of the group reported on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (DSS) are now cleaning up the city after the remaining group of militants hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held hostage by militants, advised the Reuters Agency, Charfan Darvis, of the Manbij Military Council's SAS.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we're doing cleaning operations," he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of federal tax
Hillary Clinton announced on Friday her 2015 tax returns, which showed that the Presidents of the Democratic Party and her husband had a $10.75 million income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in charity contributions, mainly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in fees for statements, and the former Secretary of State declared income of $3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure in the State Department.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, together with his wife, Anna Holton, published tax returns in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set a standard of financial transparency,” said Clinton Jennifer Palmieri, a pre-election adviser, in a statement.
In total contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and violates his past promises to publish his tax declarations.
It is customary for candidates to publish their tax declarations to the US President, although the law does not require them to do so.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers called the State Tax Service audit a reason for his refusal to publish his tax declarations.
“Your move,” wrote the adviser to the Clinton Jan Sams election headquarters on Twitter, referring to the declaration of a candidate from a democratic party.
On Thursday, Special Adviser to Trump Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow the Trump to release them before the inspection was completed.
Critics of Trump, including a candidate for Presidents from the Republic Party in 2012, Mitta Romni and other members of the Republicans said that his refusal raised questions about his status, his charities, his business operations and other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton grasped this issue and released an online video on Friday, which focused on the prominent Republicans who convinced Trump to publish the tax report.
Thursday, she raised this issue during the debate on the economy in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what everyone has done without exception to the presidential candidates for decades: to publish their tax declarations,” she said to the assembly.
Politico reported that Trump did not pay any taxes or almost any taxes for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business reviewer quoted many tax lawyers and accountants on Friday who believe that this may still be the case.
Federal tax rates have become the subject of a dispute in the presidential election.
Clinton supported a rule named after the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would guarantee that people receiving more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, suggested that the Trump meet and exchange tax declarations.
Buffett said that he was also under IRS control, and that Trump was "fearing" not by tax collection agencies but by voters.
Clinton's pre-election headquarters published tax declarations until 2007.
The Clintons currently living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
The Clintons Declaration 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost index web trust, and Clintons claimed dividends and capital gains of $109 000.

Chili powder condoms and fireworks enhance the protection of Tanzanian elephants
In Tanzania, environmental fighters use a innovative way to prevent elephants from becoming entrenched in human habitats — condoms filled with powdered chili.
The method was effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came to mind a few years ago, together with the American Committee for Nature Protection, took over its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a nonviolent, four-step, way of protecting their homes and crops without causing animal damage.
Many used spears to protect themselves before.
Friday will be the World Elephant Day dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we have developed a set of tools... we have seen a change of relationship within these communities, making them much more confident that they will be able to keep elephants out of their fields without causing elephants any harm," said the executive director, Honeyguy Damian Bell, in a statement.
The first two steps are to burn the torch before the breaking elephant border and signal the horn.
If he has not been intimidated, they throw away the so-called Chili cloud.
Chili powder, mixed with soil, is placed with the boy in the condom, and his end turns, only the filter left outside.
When the condoms are burned, they hatch with the grotto, spraying the powder of chili in the air.
One duo is usually enough to turn an elephant to the other side.
The ultimate measure is a trigger device that shoots Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
Thirty-two Turkish diplomats have not yet returned to Turkey, who left the country after attempting a coup in July.
Such data was reported by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Mevlut Chavushoglu, in talks with local journalists.
In the first phase, we have withdrawn 208 diplomats to continue their work at the centre.
Of these, 32 have not returned without objective reasons and explanations," said the head of the Turkish foreign policy office.
Recall that in July, a coup attempt took place in Turkey.
The authorities have officially declared that the coup has failed and reported that more than 6,000 people have been detained, including high- and middle-ranking military charges.
The attempted coup attempt killed 290 people, according to the Turkish Ministry of Justice.
A Jewish director severely criticized the Berlin hotel for removing Israel’s phone code by “request” of Arabs, reported the RT News channel.
A French director of Jewish origin unveiled a scandal in the media, finding that the Kampinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not have Israel's telephone code on its list, while servants refer to "requests" by Arab clients.
Claude Lantzman, author of the documentary film on the Holocaust Shaw, expressed his displeasure with the Kampinski Bristol hotel in Berlin, wrote an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the Lantzman Hotel, he tried to locate Israel on the telephone code list provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among States where direct calls could be made from the room.
How could it have happened that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was disfellowshipped and eradicated?
He wrote Lanzman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to recruit Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In search of an explanation, the director raised this issue at the hotel administration's stand.
The answer he received there, according to Lanzman, "has shocked him."
The hotel's client said that the measure was "a well-thought-out solution to the management of the Kempinski hotel network."
The reason behind this step was even more angry with the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they have demanded that Israel's code be removed," said Lanzmann, a hotel official.
The Israeli Ambassador to Germany, James Hadas-Kandelsman, called the case “a terrible disgrace, ” reports the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible shame.
What happened in Germany and in this network of hostels is even more embarrassing.
There's no need for explanations here.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," said the official.
The case caused a lot of resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that Kempinski's hotel simply "missed over" the alleged demands of Arab clients.
“We would be ashamed,” said another post, stating that a hotel located on the famous street of Kurfurstendamm is near the synagogue.
The hotel itself hastened to drop any charges, calling what happened "inspection" and "excusing" to Lanzman, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel on the list of quick recruitment," quoted the representative of the Kempinski newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students faced police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday, when they gathered to protest government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The riots began when police officers tried to excommunicate the students, resulting in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
According to the proposals made by the Governor of São Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be reassigned to save money.
Some protestors could be seen writing on the wall of the graffiti against interim President Michael Tamer.
This latest protest took place just days after the protestors went out to support President-in-Office Dilmu Rusef when the Senate voted in favour of her impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71%, reports RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, the trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent over the previous year, according to Ambassador Levan Jagaryan of Russia in Iran.
Since international sanctions against Iran had been lifted, there was an increase in Russian firms ' interest in running a business in the country, the Ambassador said.
Russian companies are reconnecting with Iran and new firms are ready to access the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Jagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the trade between Russia and Iran had increased by 70.9 per cent over the same period in 2015 to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved through the supply of machine equipment, ground vehicles and weapons," said the Ambassador.
Jagaryan also predicts that Russia will visit a record number of Iranian tourists this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic office in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly tourist visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran entered the top 20 countries for the first time by the number of tourists visiting Russia.
We can say with certainty that last year's record of the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be beaten," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Jed, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition," he said.
The State continues to twist the hooks in the defence and industrial complex.
The reason for dismissal was the “systematic failure” of the director's orders to the Almaz Antay concert director, the “discharge” and the “loss of confidence”.
Gennady Bendersky has been appointed as the NGO leader for the next three years.
The information on the dismissal of Nestard appeared only Thursday evening and did not give rise to widespread media resonance.
How can such silence be explained in the context of a massive armament of the army?
It is likely that the RF leadership does not wish to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This too is confirmed by the fact that the defence and industrial complex (OPC) has many problems and the State does not wish to draw more attention to them by society.
The removal of Unpredictables is undoubtedly an important event in terms of how to bring order to the industry.
The NGO Almaz is the main venture of a concert hall that specializes in the production of marine and ground-based air defence systems.
Almaz is currently working on the establishment of Poliment-Redut and Morpheus, which are planned for new corsets, frigates, esminians and cruisers.
The founder of the Military Russia portal Dmitry Kornev considers that the dismissal of Nehradoda is due to the cancellation of the time limits for the projects.
This is the most logical version.
For example, the development of Morpheus began in 2007 and the introduction of the formation was expected in 2013.
"Polement-Redut" should become the main system of the Air Force on the newest VF ships.
According to the information I receive, no real successful test has been performed in a few years.
The truth is, as far as I can tell, there's no clear fault of Almaza,' said Kornev.
The expert is afraid that a delay in entry into service may also occur with the “C-500” RAC.
Project experience and design has not yet been completed, but during 2016 the first complexes have to join the troops.
In the Minoborones, it is assured that “the work is planned and will be completed within the prescribed time frame”, although in 2014 the agency acknowledged problems with the development of the P-500.
It is extremely difficult to evaluate the professional qualities of Nehradov, who led Almaz since 2011.
Kornev noted that project time breaks could be both a cause and a reason for dismissal.
In his view, it had become extremely difficult in recent years to obtain information on internal processes in CCA and business management plans.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and large money is known to love silence.
As a general rule, the Directors of the Defence Companies are either removed from office on their own request, under a contract of agreement of the parties or transferred to another office.
In the present case, the suspension took place in public, although not resonant.
This suggests that the leader of Almaza may have been a stroptive figure and resisted a downward spiral.
It seems that the State no longer intends to accept such conduct.
By shareholders' hands, it will remove those who prefer to argue with Minoboron's installations and do not fulfil the tasks set.
At the same time, the management of the FF seeks to punish the leading managers (meaning the Starcraft Shipyards).
The President has given increased attention to sector issues.
Vladimir Putin presides over the Military Industrial Commission and holds periodically re-armament meetings.
The Kremlin protects the ranks of OPC managers, seeking to have a loyal composition of directors, who will perform the orders received from above.
This is a far from perfect policy, but there are no other instruments in the State against corruption and lack of normal competition in the CCW.
The situation in the defence, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical environment stimulates the Kremlin to bring the Armed Forces to order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the “cleaning” of managers in OPC, the RF leadership is taking very successful steps to improve the professionalism of Russian troops.
The army's personnel have acquired new quality as Minister of Defence Sergey Shaygu.
It seems that the President has taken on a famous saying, "You want peace, ready for war."
During the cold war, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which had established the Moscow sphere of influence on the continent.
In all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked well.
The lack of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East were evidence of that.
The triumphant celebration of the cold war ultimately resulted in the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of attacks in Europe and the United States in the “civilized world”, there may not be a single calm corner left.
Despite general distress, the West refuses to speak to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
Under such circumstances, the Navy and the army remain the only allies of our country.
Strengthening military power will enable Moscow to more effectively defend national interests and to enter the new borders of world politics.
Scotlander Callum Skinner is racing on the finish line, bringing the British to collect bicycle gold
Scotsman Callum Skinner ran to the triumphant at a men's command post at the velodrome in Rio last night, protecting the British commanding trio from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old Glazgo birthday boy was the strongest one his Scottish friend, Sir Chris Hoy, made his own, and the young man proudly entered history by sneaking through the finish line to get a victory from a New Zealand favorite team.
Britain declared its right to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning when Hoy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they retraced the trick after finishing modestly the sixth in the March World Cup at the London track tracks, despite Hoy's having completed his career ever since.
The question between Beijing and London was replaced by a specialist named Jamie Staff.
They did what they did just when Hindes came in.
Hoy's exit also created the void that Kian Emmadi and Matt Krumpton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man held by British coaches who saw the potential in Scots, which was now realized.
Hindes, Kenny, the Hoi champions four years ago, and Skinner set the Olympic record in their qualifications, but the regulations were surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British Trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was right behind his circle, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner backed up.
The change of strategy was a major part of the transformation, where Hindes drove for more gear to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched from his seat as an invited expert to the BBC and caught a glimpse of Skinner, Kenny, and Hindez when they entered the pedestal.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a rough comparison."
I'm here to do everything I can to make a name for myself.
We set the Olympic record in the finals and beat the world's champions.
That was amazing.
There's no better way to win.
After a triumph in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes confessed to a deliberate fall on the track after a failed start.
He later renounced the commentary, and there was no way to appeal from British competitors.
There was no such thing this time in the greatest victory.
Hendez said, "I felt like I was in London with all those British flags on the rostrum."
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
We've lost so many races with a world name that winning the Olympics again was just amazing.
This is one event, one gold medal for the country, which won seven out of 10 names race in Beijing and London.
If this is the barometer of progress made over the past five months, then the velord will have five more successful days.
With the form shown by Kenny, it's not beyond the possibility of imagining how he repeats Hoy's feat by winning three Olympic gold medals in one game.
This would allow us to see Kenny — who was just 12 years younger than Hoi, who was also born on 23 March (this seems to be a sacred date in British sport, also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Roger Bannister) — bringing his account to six gold medals and one silver one.
It would also be Hoy's.
Next time, Kenny competes in a sprint that starts today and starts playing for three days.
A 28-year-old boy from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You're coming to win with your friends.
It's a little lonely playing alone, to be honest.
He said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he has to get a knighthood."
It was the only medal-playing day, but it was good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke, and Owen Dull are qualified as the fastest four-mile team chase in four.
They finished at 3:51.943.
The world record of gold winning in London 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will be held today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be the focus.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of a qualifying visit, when officials asked him to measure his weight.
In the relevant women's event, which is being resumed and concluded tomorrow, Laura Trutt, Joanna Rousselle Shand, Eleanor Barker, and Kathy Archibald of Milgawi improved the world record by showing time 4:13.260.
The United Kingdom Command has come to believe that a powerful team of cyclists will take over the Middle Ages of the Olympic Games and earn a lot of medals.
After truly exceptional demonstrations of full superiority in Beijing and London, expectations have weakened in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There have been dramas in the second plan, not the last, the departure from the post of Technical Director Shane Sutton in April because of allegations of sexism and harassment, and the care of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the first evening’s race on the velodrome, it seems that the legendary glory of Britain now appears to be in reaching its peaks at the right time, perhaps just once again.
Future of the Portland steel factory threatened by the dissolution of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland Aluminium Plant in Victoria — as well as hundreds of jobs — is threatened by the fact that the electricity company that supplies the plant, according to one owner, is going to terminate the supply contract: all supply contracts are planned to be terminated.
This step is a consequence of the decision taken earlier this year by the Government of Victoria not to extend the subsidies to support the operation of the plant.
A fixed grant of 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at the Alcoa plant in Portland.
A total of 2,000 jobs — directly and indirectly — can be found in the risk zone as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects, as the metal production plant consumes about 10 per cent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed down a steel factory in Point Henry, leading to the closure of the Englsa power plant last year.
The Portland steel factory of Alcoa is losing money and risking closure.
These actions have been the product of reflection on the future of the factory, which has been going on for several years, initially due to the strong positions of the Australian dollar and later because of the cost of the plant ' s products.
AGL, which supplies a large aluminium plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrob Valley, reported that it expected that the other three owners would also take steps to terminate the contract.
The control share of the plant is owned by the joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, while the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp are owned by smaller shares.
“AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, i.e. the physical demand for electricity from the steel plant will not stop”, she said.
According to AGL, the contracts referred to are the so-called “hedged contracts” which were to enter into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month period of dissolution, so they will actually end in 2017.
“AGL therefore still expects these contracts to bring its share of the income in the financial year 2017”, said the electricity company.
Any potential impact on the profits of AGL since the 2018 financial year is currently limited to forecasts of a strong future market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already reduced the amount of contracts by $187 million in its accounts in terms of “preliminary dissolution”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts “does not affect the ability of Alcoa to operate a steel plant or to supply electricity to a steel factory”.
The American company stated that in 2010 it had entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which was due to enter into force in November of this year, but still had to explain why it had terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland steel mill in Victoria and the Tomago factory near Newcastle due to the unfavourable economic situation in the industry.
Addressing analysts earlier this week, AGL Chief of Operations Steven Michelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy each year, and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in market demand [electricity].
It will be bad for us as a manufacturer," he said.
Not only the star reality show Kardashian, Kendall on the cover of September's Vogue number
Kendall Jenner, 20, the model and fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, Chris, appeared on the leading September cover of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who is the face of the Estee Lauder brand and defiled on Sundays of fashion in Milan, Paris and New York, reported this news in her Instagram account on Thursday.
“When I was in the room with my favorite people, I looked at the cover and cried, ” wrote Kendall.
The new cover was accompanied by strange (or simply in the spirit of the Cardassian Family?) prepared by a reality-video in which the whole Cardassian-Gener family (Rob and Caitlin’s devels, also joined them by the universal favorite show-business uncle, producer of the Cardassian Family Ryan Sycrest), forgot the appearance of the sister on the cover, and eventually a classic turn: they planned the party-surprising.
It's a standard storyline of almost all the episodes of children's television shows dedicated to birthdays (Sikrest says, "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit from the program at 8 a.m.), but Chris had to get that glory anyway to other girls.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we have certainly entered the new era of the Kardashian show.
Let the older sister Kendall Kim fall on the cover of Vogue earlier (she appeared on it with her husband Kanye Westome in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is the most sold edition of the year by Vogue.
More like a gift than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (as estimated by the Fashionista portal, 615 pages from last year's 832 pages of advertising).
News of who from the stars will fall on his cover is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years, photographs of the magazine have merged before the official anon.
Former women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has certainly presented more “models” than “models that are celebrities”.
The Oscar Prize winner and Dior Jennifer Lawrence's brand face was presented on the cover in 2013, one year after that honour came to Lady Gage.
But even in the unlikely case, if Jenner, the magazine that he described as his generation's "issued model", falls into the first category, she's in a good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of well-known people, stars of reality show or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (although Jenner gets into all these categories).
They are truly talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, on last year's cover, this year was one of the most successful careers in the production of the Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone's happy about Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world, because of her last star on television reality show, should always have been a dressmaker.
In June, one of Victoria's Secret Stephanie Seymour's first models criticized Jenner and her colleague, Gigi Hadid, calling them "sucks of the moment".
These sentiments were repeated after the news of Jenner’s appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But it doesn't make sense to get caught up in discontent.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of September's Vogue number.
It is a supermodel in all senses of the word.
She's defiling for Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you a ton cream from Estee Lauder.
She, and all her sisters, sell you her pictures in her paybook applications.
She sells handmade photographs of Cindy Crawford's daughter's LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, maybe still seeing her sister Courtney and her kids, she's involved in reality show on TV.
Public legal centres refuse to serve 160,000 people per year
Every year, more than 160,000 least protected people refuse to serve in public legal centres, as the sector is preparing for an effect that will further reduce funding for already existing activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people unable to cope with unjust deprivation of property and so on — have already refused to seek legal assistance and representation free of charge.
Public legal services that are already operating outside the scope are preparing for further reductions.
Since June next year, these legal centres must lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
James Farrell, Director of the Public Law Centres of Queensland, said that according to the latest census of the National Association of Public Legal Centres, thousands of people were already denied a year.
Farrell said that if the Federal Government's decision was not annulled, the situation would only deteriorate.
“Quinsland’s social legal centres are constantly underfunded: that means thousands of people are denied the vital services they need”, he said.
People who have been forced out of relationships, people with unruly and destructive debts, families through divorce, unjustly fired workers — all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The Federal Government will cut the funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means that thousands of less protected people in Queensland will have to deal with complex legal issues without assistance.
We call upon the Minister of Justice and Senator Quinsland George Brandis to immediately cancel these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need when they face legal problems.
Last year, the State Government fulfilled its commitment to raising funding for free legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to draw attention to the needs of the public legal centres and communities, their clients, and the Government of Palaczuk is about to get involved in this important work.
Donald Trump was tried at the pre-election headquarters after the staff member allegedly threatened with a gun.
According to New York City, Donald Trump was tried at the pre-election headquarters: the headquarters reportedly did nothing after the report that his North Carolina Operations Director had threatened a staff member with a gun while they were driving in a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed in the State Court on Wednesday at Charlotte Vincent Bordini, former software instructor at the State Pre-election Headquarters.
Bordini said he'd waited a few months for the problem to be resolved internally, but he realized that "it won't happen."
Director Earl Fillip “put the gun out, put his right index finger on the hen and put the blow on Vincent’s kneecap,” so said Boardini in a complaint.
Complaining to the local and regional office of the Pre-election Headquarters, Bordinini realized that at least four others had become participants in similar incidents with Philip, he argued that he had been treated.
"Pistols don't have to be shot to cause damage," said Bordini in a complaint.
Just two days after the Republican party's presidential candidate had a furor, he told North Carolina listeners that “people of the Second Amendment” — understood as the owners of arms and their loved ones — could begin to act if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and could elect judges.
Trampa's pre-election headquarters said that the media had withdrawn his words from the context and that he had not spoken in support of violence.
In her complaint, Bordini claims compensation from the election headquarters for negligence and from Phillip for the threat of physical violence, abuse and moral harm.
Representative of Trump Hope Hicks Medolith, responding to a request for comment.
Attempts to talk to Phillip failed.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Philip had recently left the election headquarters.
In response to a call from his consulting firm, the Innovation Consulting Services, no one called back quickly.
A presidential candidate from the Republican party, Donald Trump, conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Supreme Court of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain has to put the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand the Hytrow.
It will also bring resurgence and prosperity not only to our localities but also to London as a whole, throughout the country.
In my opinion, this was precisely the huge advantage of Hitrou, just as it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to ensure that our peoples and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympic Games have greatly benefited Stratford and East End.
And we'll do it again, creating opportunities for locals and firms close to Heathrow.
We will only create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
As was the case before London 2012, those who think that the expansion of Hitra will be too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics, and that we would be in a difficult position on the world scene.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012 and will prove them wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Hitrau answers any question asked about it.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just for a narrow circle.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment around the airport and across the United Kingdom.
We have a wonderful team in Heathrow, which has implemented the programme of £11 billion of infrastructure investments in time and within the budget, from T5 to T2 of the best five consecutive years of terminals built in the middle of the world's two most busy runways.
They are now ready to provide a third runway confirmed by Pound16 billion of private investment.
The 2012 Olympic Games in London have been a huge success for Britain, and I am sure that the expansion of Hitrau will also be.
The time has come for us to put the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand the Hytrow, ensuring our trade future and creating the heritage of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton, President of the Council of Heathrow and former Trade Attache Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook plays in "cats" on blocking advertising
For companies that make money on the Internet commercial, trying to bypass advertising software is a game in "cats" according to one of the companies that creates such software.
Thursday, just a few days after Facebook announced that it was going to block advertising blockers on its desktop version of the website, Adblock Plus published a blog that users could update their filters on the program to block advertising online again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site was changing the line around its advertising to make it more difficult for advertising blockers to recognize which parts of the page are advertising.
But Adblock now says he was able to bypass the new code.
In his blog publication, the representative of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of mutual struggle between the community of open source advertising blockers and those who are trying to circumvent it has continued since the discovery of advertising blockage” and that Facebook may present its own solution in the near future.
The fact that the largest social network in the world has entered into a struggle is a clear indication of the extent to which advertising blockers for the industry have become a major problem.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use advertising blockers, according to last year's Pagefair and Adobe study; almost four times the number of people who used such software in 2013.
Given the 1.3 billion daily active users who come to Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook advertising revenues.
However, the company is looking for desktop advertising blockers because mobile advertising blockers are ineffective in mobile Facebook applications for the social network and Instagram, according to the representative.
But advertising on the table is a lucrative enough article to make Facebook consider such a step a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to update its “recommendations” tool to give people more control over how advertising is targeted.
On Thursday, Facebook stated that the new Adblock filters were of concern, as they would also block some unreceptive content on the website.
“This will not be a good experience for people, and we are planning to solve this problem,” said a Facebook representative in an official e-mail.
Advertising blockers are a rough tool, so instead we're focused on creating tools like Advertisers to hand over management to people.
A woman was moved to a Swiss highway in an episode of apparent suicide.
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police call on witnesses after a woman was moved to the highway early Thursday morning in a clear attempt to commit suicide.
The incident occurred at A1 near Morzh in the canton of V just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman was lying on the road in the darkness of the gesture of despair and was hit by several vehicles, reported to the police in a statement.
In an attempt to kill themselves, the victim, a Swiss woman at the age of 49, struck several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several involved drivers have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified, the police, who called on them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case, a “logical” step in such a situation, was initiated, lawyer Jile Hofstadter Le Tribune de Geneve said.
However, it remains to be ascertained whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid hitting?
That is what the prosecutor must determine," Hofstadter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case — both of which involve a person walking in the dark on the highway — a sentence was handed down that motorists could not expect an accident to meet a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, an officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she struck and killed a man lying on A1 near Payern in August 2014.
A 22-year-old victim drank and lost consciousness on the road, listened to the trial.
The Court found that the female police officer, who had responded to the emergency call, had managed the vehicle in a way that was justified and that the presence of a person on the road was “extremely exceptional and unpredictable situation”, said the judge.
Anyone with information about the incident on Thursday at the Seas is required to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once inhabited
Venus may have been inhabited once, according to the assessment of the new NASA climate model.
Scientists from the Nazi Space Research Institute Goddard developed a model for research into the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions similar to those of the earth could exist on Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and atmosphere saturated with carbon dioxide.
Scientists previously assumed that Venus’s small rotation rate was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest modelling suggests that Venus might have had a dissipated atmosphere like this on earth and still have to rotate slowly.
The model also considered the topography of the early Venus.
There were probably more dry regions on the planet than on Earth, but once there was enough water and enough geographical variability to create living conditions and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 per cent thicker.
“Agreed to the GISS model, Venus’s slow rotation gives its daily side to the sun for almost two months at a time,” explained GISS scholar Anthony Del Henio in a press release.
This warms the surface of the planet and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, operating as an umbrella that protects the surface of the planet from a substantial part of solar heat.
The result is average climatic temperatures, which are no wonder a few degrees colder than in our day on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development previously envisioned by planetary scientists.
Despite the fact that Venus may have once been inhabited, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Her oceans evaporated and her water vapors were burned by ultraviolet radiation.
When her hydrogen flew off, it was only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect — that is, Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche team
Patrick Roy left as coach and vice president of Colorado Avalanche hockey on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the team decision-making process.
Executive Vice President / Chief Head of the Joe Sakik Colorado team confirmed the news and noticed that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have served as chief coach and vice president of Colorado Avalanche hockey activities with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
During the summer, I thought long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey activities must coincide perfectly with the vision of the organization.
It shall also have the right to vote in decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions have not yet been met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patric told me about his decision today," Sakik said.
We appreciate all he has done for our organization, and we wish him success in the future.
Roy became Jack Adams Award winner as the best league coach during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and victory in Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and lost the playoffs two last years.
The Avalanche team announced an evaluation of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and five points behind the Wild team in the fight for a second concessional path to participate in the Western Conference.
The doorman from Slava Hall, Roy won four Stanley Cups, two with Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
Northern Sea oil tankers resume negotiations and suspend strike
Work strikes on oil wages in the North Sea had been suspended, and all the parties to the discussion were beginning a new round of negotiations, the leading representatives of the parties reported.
The strikes against the oil service company Wood Group were sporadic on platforms in the North Sea operated by the Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and Unions Unite and RMT can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process for the settlement of current disputes”, said the joint statement.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting next week, to look at the issues with fresh eyes.
Trade unions reported that their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, had been directed against potential wage cuts of up to 30 per cent.
Wood Group reduced the rates paid to contract employees working in the North Sea by about 9 per cent this year due to negative market tensions.
The company's rates decreased after a 10 per cent reduction in the rates for contract employees working on the shore in 2014.
According to the company, additional reductions will give it the space needed to overcome the market's decline.
Shell, for its part, has reduced thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil-gasing activities in countries by up to 10, because it is rationalizing its activities as a result of its mega-molecular merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of reduced oil prices: the economic situation has deteriorated as a result of the decision to withdraw from the European Union, adopted in June by Britain.
The Scottish member of Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour conflicts in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for the majority, not just for some," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion of new projects in the North Sea are expected in 2016, at an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of star rotation in the Pleiade Colony
The last mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to gather the most complete catalogue of star rotation speeds within the Pleiade cluster.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why the stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds as well as how rotational periods relate to planetary formation.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system”, said Louis Ribal, a researcher at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Centre at the California Institute of Technology, in a press release.
The Pleiade is excavated in 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the shell are now only ripe; they were born some 125 million years ago.
They're going as fast as they'll ever be.
At their peak speeds, these adult stars emit large amounts of starwind.
By traveling through the magnetic field of stars, these winds have a braking effect on the stars.
As the star ages, the speed of its rotation starts to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of each star’s rotation by tracking the time between the known star spots, such as sunspots.
A new catalogue of rotational speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Ribal compares stars with dancers: larger ones make pyruettes slower than smaller ones.
"We see in ballet pleiade that those who spin slowly are usually more massive, whereas those who spin faster usually refer to very light stars," Ribal said.
Since the pleiade is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare star properties with rotational speeds.
“The star cluster of the Pleiade provides a starting point for theoretical patterns of star rotation, both younger and older,” Ribal said.
We want to know a lot more about how, where and why stars slow down their speed and hang their dance shoes on their nails, as it were.
Ribal and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of the Pleiade speeds in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
An investigation into the activities of a group of Ukrainian diversants in Crimea is conducted by two agencies, writes Kommersant.
The FSB collects evidence of detainees ' involvement in the preparation of diversions in Crimea.
As previously reported, the resident of the Ukrainian town of Energodar Evgeny Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation, gave a confession.
He said that he viewed Titan’s chemical plant in Armenia, the oilbase in Feodosia, the Kerchen ferry, the gas pipeline, and one of the military airfields as facilities for diversification.
Lawyers believe that not all divisives have been apprehended.
This, in particular, was the basis for the arrest of suspects in the Symferopol Kiev Raid, notes the publication.
Stanislaw Cherchesov became chief coach of the Russian team's soccer team
At a meeting of the members of the Russian Football Union, a decision was taken to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov as the principal coach of the collecting Russia for football.
The contract with it will be for two years, until the conclusion of PM-2018.
On 11 August, the Russian Federation appointed Stanislav Cherchesov as the main coach of the U.S. football team.
He is a well-known football player who played at Moscow's Spartacus for the position of goalkeeper, as well as a coach with solid experience, who was a mentor of Russian teams such as the same "Spartacus", "Jemchužina-Sochi", "Terek", "Amkar", "Dinamo", and "Legia" Warsaw, which was the winner of the country's national championship and cup.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchezov will be signed as soon as possible and for two years.
It is therefore his responsibility to prepare for the 2018 World Championship.
It is known that Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stauce, Vladimir Pannikov will join his training headquarters.
There is information that the total salary of the training staff will be 2.6 billion euros per year.
According to the media, the RFC leadership set the goal of Stanislav Churchesov to bring the collective Russia to the semi-final and win medals.
As the coach himself said, he considered the establishment of a competitive environment on the team as a priority and was going to give footballers an opportunity to demonstrate themselves.
He also said that he was glad that he had a choice.
The first match, under the leadership of Churchesov, will be held on 31 August in Antalya, which will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Recall that Leonid Slutsky, former head coach of the Russian soccer team, was associated with his training at the CSKA club.
He announced his resignation after the Russian national team made a statement to the Euro-2016 in France.
In doing so, he took responsibility for the bad outcome of the gathering.
With the delay between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
However, since South Africa gained independence in 1990, the country with a population of 2.4 million has achieved tremendous success, especially in the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia ' s success is that the Government pays high attention to education.
While people in developed countries consider themselves to be free primary and secondary education, in many poor countries in secondary and even primary schools, education fees are required.
Moreover, Governments are often advised to introduce fees for “reimbursement”.
However, education in primary schools is free of charge in Namibia.
Moreover, secondary education has been free since 2015.
The authorities are also active in other important areas.
Malaria eradication efforts have reduced the number of annual cases of illness by 97 per cent over the past 10 years.
Contrary to the international trend in inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
The Gini ratio, which is the standard indicator of income inequality, dropped by 15 points compared to 1993.
At the time, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
And poverty declined from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 a day) has also decreased from almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest rate of freedom of expression in Africa, according to the “Reporters Without Borders”.
The United States and other rich States have gone far ahead of the country.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating -- one of the highest in Africa -- in the Indekse Perception of Corruption, which is made up of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now that the prices for raw materials are falling, Namibia is able to maintain a high rate of growth.
At the same time, debt-to-GDP ratio is around 25%, which is less than 1/3 of the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems and problems.
Unemployment rates, at least in traditional valuation methods, remain high - almost 28 per cent.
And, like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high incidence of HIV/AIDS, almost 17 per cent of the population is infected.
The World Bank estimates that Namibia is one of the upper middle-income countries, but the authorities insist that their State is indeed a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some difficulties that are common to poorly developed economies.
The State had to develop a very large and dry country with a small population.
In the deserts of the country, there are isolated nomadic tribes of hunter-gatherers who must be integrated into modern society without losing their identity.
Integrating people who had been on the outskirts of the world economy a quarter of a century ago is not an easy task for any country.
It is even more difficult for Namibia: just like any other country in the world, it is facing the effects of climate change.
Namibia, however, did not think to give up, and the country is solving the problems facing it.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities engaged in the establishment of a diversified economy and a united society.
It is remarkable that competing political factions have gathered together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap medical care not only for its own citizens but also for its neighbours.
About 15-20 per cent of health-care visitors in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is talking about building a wall that separates the country from the poor and corrupt neighbours.
Namibians realized that they did not choose their neighbours but decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate in sharing water resources, participating in regional health projects, encouraging investment and student exchange.
In addition, the Government of Namibia has rightly considered that rich natural resources can easily be a curse, contributing to the enrichment of few at the expense of many.
The authorities understand that the income from the natural resources of Namibia needs to be invested in infrastructure and productive capacity.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to seek the maximum profit from the sale of the country ' s resources and to review investment laws and mining contracts to make sure that this is the case.
Transparency was crucial for this process, and the Government ' s strong support for freedom of speech was so important.
According to the Head of State of The Hague Heingob, the media often say things that they don't like.
But since the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms it has received, the President said.
Not all of Namibia ' s key resources are exhaustive.
Some, such as fisheries, are renewable, and the Government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries that begin with serious shortcomings -- racism, colonial order, inequality and low levels of development -- can embark on a path towards shared prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard of the Golden of Varna, the ancient gold objects created by man (4,600 - 4,200 years before our Common Era).
It may have been the loudest archaeological sensation in the 1970s: in Bulgaria, when the excavations of the Varna necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artifacts was found -- more than 3,000 of a total weight of 6 kg.
Only from a single burial known as “may be 43”, 990 gold items were extracted with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the ancient gold of the world could soon be passed on to the non-sighted busin found by archaeologists in July this year.
Again in Bulgaria, in a prehistoric settlement known as the Tell of the Yunats.
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tel Yunatsi is located far from the sea, near the village of the Yunats of Pazardjik district.
The Busin is a gold strip that's turned into a ring.
Yavor Bojadzhiev, director of excavations at Tella Yunatsi, dated 4600 years before our era and declared that she was at least 200 years older than Varna's gold.
Varna's treasure, let's remind you, dates back to about the same period, 4600 to 4200 years before our era.
There is no technology available to allow metal dating with impeccable precision.
How, then, does confidence in what gold is more ancient?
Apparently, Professor Bojadjiev knows more than he told Reuters, "I'm pretty sure the gold of the young men is more than Varna's gold."
It's a very important discovery: from the perspective, it's a tiny object, but it's big enough to take a proper place in history.
In an interview, Reuters Boyajiev reported that scientists would soon analyze the composition of the metal and re-examine the archaeological layer where the gold artifact was found.
This will help to provide the maximum accuracy of the van.
The site explains a lot, too.
Tell the Yuan is a famous settlement, even if you've never heard of it.
The Tell Young People is now considered an ancient city of Europe.
Telll was founded by descendants of people migrating to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium before our era.
For centuries thereafter, metal processing in the region has developed dramatically, from the development of the first metallurgy skills to the creation of a fully-fledged industry.
The national history of this archaeological community has a special title: the Balkano-Carpathian Metallug Province.
In the 5 millenniums before our era around the metal processing centers began to form urban settlements.
They are now referred to as the ancient cities of Europe.
Of these, Tel Youngs may be the oldest, since they found artifacts 4900 years before our era.
I'd call the Tel Yunats a prototype of the modern city, although it's a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This is the place of older Shumer for a thousand years," said Boyajiev, in view of the widely accepted view that urban culture was born in southern Mesopotamia, a modern Iraq.
The first cities came into being in the habit of understanding that word.
Tell the Young Ones' Rasks have been held since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists excavated nearly 12 hectares, about a third of the estimated total settlement area.
The remains of the fortress wall were found, which had once reached a height of three metres.
Few houses and workshops have survived, but archaeologists clearly distinguish the streets, the public buildings, the city’s denser construction, the business center and the residential landscapes.
Tel Yuanites often call it Bird City: dozens of clay bird figurines were found here.
All the birds are depicted as being in a state of peace, from which it was assumed that they were not decorative objects but the object of the local cult.
The Bird City was destroyed about 4100 years before our era, possibly the Indo-European tribes from the north-east.
The nomads had no cities, but they had horses and guns.
The three-meter fortress walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists have found obvious signs of violent fighting: the remains of the elderly, women and children were found inside the houses with traces of wounds caused by the fighting cannons.
New findings and new facts are emerging annually, changing the usual perceptions of the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking, not about individual cultures, but about the “lost” first civilization of Europe, which originated in the Balkans.
A powerful incentive to find this civilization was the “Golden of Varna” found relatively recently in 1972.
Logically, the golden luxury of Varna had to be preceded by something like a tiny golden van created at the Tella Youth.
In Porsche, the 911 Targa model was artificially aged.
It is officially stated that the preparation of the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is conducted manually by the specialists of the unit that operate the serial machinery.
The retro-loop is, for example, in the special color of the body of Etna Blue, which was developed in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model, even the model logo is painted in this color.
In addition, the trade fair received a firm white chart along boardboards and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel drives, as well as some details of body layout embellished in “white-gold metal”.
In the interior of retro-retro-tickets, it is noticeably smaller: it differs from the large size of the grey-blue gamma structure to the new chairs with extended bands of electro-regulatory and separate black anodized steel thresholds with the unit logo.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive car shoes and a well-deposited album with photographs of the manufacturing process.
The strength of the Porsche Exclusive device does not touch steel: the retro-argae characteristics are exactly the same as the serial one.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with a turbocharger of 3.0 l, developing 420 l and 500 Nm.
The dynamicst version of the 911 Targa 4S is capable of accelerating to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released with limited circulation, but neither its volume nor the cost of each particular athlete is reported.
Facebook and advertising blockers untied the arms race.
The recent introduction of Facebook technology to prevent advertising on social media pages has provoked decision makers to block advertising for retaliatory actions.
At AdBlock Plus, they released an antidote, but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus predicted its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time.
The socialists noted that, in an effort to deceive the new technology of unblocked advertising, AdBlock Plus’s decision, together with commercial announcements, blocked many regular posts from friends or pages.
On Facebook, AdBlock Plus regretted this policy and promised to solve the problem soon.
According to the socialist source for TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the Facebook desktop will be available within the next hours.
The socialists and blockers thus untied a kind of “arms race” by trying to play each other, the affected party became users who missed interesting recordings from friends or who saw advertisements where they were not used to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of blocking advertising have recently sparked heated disputes.
In Murmansk the rapist will appear before the court of justice · The evening Murmansk.
His case had already been investigated in the Investigation Committee of the Russian Federation on the Murmansk Region.
The charge against a 54-year-old man is very serious: sexual assault.
The investigation found that, at the end of November 2015, the accused in the area of Pavlov Street in Murmansk had committed sexual acts of violence against a 20-year-old girl.
The penalties provided for in this article are maximum sentences of imprisonment of up to six years.
Dongfeng will take Fengguang 370 to Russia and Rich New pick-up site www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a popular representative in China of a class of vehicles that combines the dignity of a minivan and a crossover.
Another Russian premiere is the Rich New pickup.
Many Western firms in the Moscow International Motor Vehicle decided to ignore this year, so the empty exhibition halls of Crocus Expo will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, Dongfeng Motor, a powerful front, will be launched, with great features on the Russian market, and the intention to offer some interesting news to our car lovers in the near future.
One of these will be Crosswen Dongfeng Fengguang 370, which was sold in China at a price of 55,900 Yuan (just under 550,000 rubs at the current rate).
The Russians are unlikely to be able to shed light on the issue of supplies to our country while the discussion is under way.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 was able to reach 11th place on the list of the most sold minions, although due to high road education (175 mm) and protective plastic covering on the lower perimeter of the body could well be assigned to the crosses.
Crosswain was built on the Fengguang 360, the 370s, a 2725 mm wheelbase, but the body was slightly longer (4565 mm versus 4510 mm), a solider design, and a richer equipment.
The living room is decorated with wooden planks, but the photo of a large vertical sensor screen "as in Tesla" on the central console was only on early exhibits of the crossvene, and the car was sold with "music" easier.
Five of the seven landing sites are easily folded, forming a flat loading area with a length of 1650 mm, the maximum volume of the trunk is 1500 litres.
The Fengguang 370 engine provides only one or 1.5-litre petrol "atmospheric" with a capacity of 115 litres, co-ordinated with a 5-degree mechanical gearbox.
The manufacturer is modestly silent about the dynamic quality of the machine, but the owner of the appetite budget is promised at 6.7 l/100 km.
Pikap Rich New is a well-known Russian NP300 Navara in the past generation, but with a slightly blessed Chinese stylist design.
Despite the morally outdated design, this model still benefits from a stable demand from the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unwilling "working horse".
At a similar price, Rich New will certainly be interested and Russian because modern Japanese pickups have become extremely expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines for choice: petrol 2.4 l (137 l) or turbosilium 2.5 l (116 l).
The gearbox is only a mechanic, a rear wheel drive, but there are modifications and with a rigid "front" connected.
He will be on the Dongfeng stand and his new A9 flagship seat, and his Russian Prime Minister's Chinese firm announced in June.
Minvenolike crossovers on the Chinese market are growing, one of the latest news -- Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
At present, the Russian Dongfeng ambulance consists of two models: S30 sedan and H30 Cross Hatchbek.
In seven months of this year, the Chinese firm’s dealers have implemented 696 cars in our country.
Transport tax notices will cease to be sent by mail at www.zr.ru
The tax inspection has changed the procedure for sending notices of property taxes.
All Russian autoowners have been accustomed to an unchanged scheme in the summer and fall of which they receive a receipt by mail for the transport tax of the previous year.
However, many will not wait this year.
The fact is that the tax inspection has changed the procedure for informing citizens without undue noise.
Those who are registered with the Office of the Payer on the official website of the department of tasks.ru will receive the notice electronically.
In the inspection, these Russians were automatically found to be online users and deleted from the standard “paper” mailing.
The novelty will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.
All others will continue to receive normal letters.
However, there is also an opportunity for users to return to the old scheme.
In order to do so, they would have to visit the tax office during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and convenient.
The notice will appear in the “personal office” immediately after the writing, while the letter will go for a few days and may disappear altogether.
In addition, the number of Internet service users has passed over 18 million people to allow the department to seriously save money on the mail.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection website is clearly not enough to inform citizens of the changed order.
Some could register in a private office to obtain one-time services and have long forgotten about it.
These people will not wait for the messages by mail and will fall into the category of non-payers with all the consequences.
There are three ways to access the personal office of the taxpayer: through the recording of the gosuslugi.ru portal, by electronic signature or input of the log and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained in person in any department of tax inspection (depending on the location of the registration).
We recall that the transport tax should be paid by 1 December this year.
The distribution of notifications began in July.
The tening Mercedes-Benz G-class, where the finishing process is designed to achieve a very high impact, something in itself.
But the controversial concept did not upset G-Power's masters, who had adopted a modification of Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its addiction to BMW cars, but nothing human to its craftsmen is foreign.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63-571-strong flying dummy with tank aerodynamics and race to a hundred and a half seconds?
The master used the advantages of a five-lit super-duty eight-litre to pump up the musculales of the crazy helicus.
And then the momentum of the race to hundreds has improved to the indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now the flange is capable of breaking in 5.3 s.
However, acceleration from medium speeds is certainly better.
The speed ceiling is frightening: if standard G 63 does not travel more than 210 km/h, the tungsten all-roader with an electronic "shepherd" capable of reaching 250 km/h.
Outside, the car is almost identical to its factory starter, except for other wheel discs - 23 double Hurricane RR size 305/35 ZR 23.
The Mercedes-Maybach luxury unit has launched a striking six-metre conceptual cluster that will be presented in the Pebble Beach elegance Contest.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the BMW i green subbrand and will advance its electrical models under a separate trade mark.
At least four environmental news outlets are expected to occur in the coming years.
