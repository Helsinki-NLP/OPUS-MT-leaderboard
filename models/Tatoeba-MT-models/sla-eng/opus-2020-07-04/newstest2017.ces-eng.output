Eight-year-old chef found dead at a shop in San Francisco
The 8th-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was the steps of the local store this week.
But the victim’s brother says that he has no idea who would want to hurt him, adding: “At last he began to succeed. ”
The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as an eight - year - old resident of San Francisco Frank Galicia, said the medical examiner’s office.
The Sanfrance Police Department has announced that this is a violent death and an investigation is under way.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, for the ABC KGO station in San Francisco, said that Frank, who was formerly a number of chefs in Boston, had won his dream job as chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
The speaker restaurant Sons & Daughters said that his deaths were "shocked and destroyed".
"We have a small team that works as a closely connected family. We will miss it very much," the speaker said.
At this difficult time, our thoughts and sorrows belong to Frank’s family and friends.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank first slept in the hostels, but that recently “he finally began to give it to him.”
"He found an apartment, he dated a girl," said Louis Galicia for the KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't think of anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a great heart.
When he wanted to get in touch with his family, he always cooked us food, made us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to get into any fights.
He was a brother who took things the way they were.
"Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was an unbrushed diamond that irradiated every day," he said.

The Czech railways have invested more than 31 billion in the modernization of vehicles.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, the state has invested more than 31 billion crowns in the modernisation of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system closed by toilet.
The amounts for modernisation in individual years with the exception of 2012 are, however, gradually falling.
The Czech tracks have invested over 31 billion crowns in the modernization of vehicles in the last six years.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system closed by toilet.
The money spent was shown to reduce the average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and by six years for classical wagons.
A larger share of the investments put the carrier into regional transport, where around 60 per cent of the money was spent, and 40 per cent of the company invested in the renewal of the vehicles for long-distance transport.
The average age of locomotive and units is currently 19 years old.
Modernised older vehicles, however, are counted as completely new in this indicator.
If vehicle upgrades were not to be counted, the average age of vehicles driving would increase by 10 years.
Some older are on average passenger cars whose average age at the start of modernisation is 23 years.
If only the age from the date of manufacture were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
The classic sets consisting of wagons and driven locomotives, however, in recent years, from the Czech and worldwide railways are gradually disappearing and are replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015 a locomotive from 280 to 223 pieces was left, and the number of classical wagons from 2716 in 2011 dropped to 2132 in the middle of this year.
In particular, the carrier was rid of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during the journey.
From January to July, he had the carrier take 110 of these vehicles.
For example, the purchase of 50 wagons for speeds up to 200 kilometres per hour, which the carrier plans to install on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for the domestic fast track, is possible from investments planned to be made in the Czech car park in the near future.
The contract includes up to 30 engine pieces and 20 electrical units.
Fourth year's bureaus know about illegal advertising, they can't get rid of it.
We're absolutely helpless, they're confessing.
For a quarter of a year edition of the online journal News.cz has been watching the story of a billboard in southern Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipna, where not only is a tourist tour in the crowns of trees, but also the Olympic park.
Highway managers know it's a blackout, but they say they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds of similar ads all over the country, maybe thousands.
According to officials, there is a vague law that makes it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
A complicated bureaucratic wheel is needed first.
In the meantime, the company will change its name, and the office is short on it.
Or just move the ad a few meters away, and the official process has to start again.
Roads and motorways management admitted a quarter of a year ago: by the main move from České Budějovice to Lipno stands on our property near the state road advertising billboard black.
For three months, however, officials were not sufficient to dispose of unauthorized portable constructions with a huge poster.
It's like no one cares that they're standing right next to the roadside, in a 50-metre security zone where nothing can happen for security reasons.
Road managers say they can't easily consult the billboard because of a bad law.
Maybe load it up and take it away.
"We can't just afford to do that," says the speaker, Directorate of Roads and Highway Nina Ledvinová, referring to the complicated bureaucratic wheel which the removal of billboard must prevent under the law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate began online journal Current.cz detailed monitoring in spring, it is not unique and shows a general problem that cannot be addressed effectively and quickly by the state and authorities.
In southern Bohemia alone, she counted dozens of similar mobile commercials placed against the rules just next to or near the road.
Similarly, other regions are involved.
"We are having trouble making the company remove the hostages," confirms the head of the Transport Department of the Czech Budějovice Regional Office, Jiří Klás, whose colleagues solve similar stories.
According to Klása, it's a dirty law that binds officials.
First of all, it's hard to reach the owner of the billboard to put the ad away.
However, bosses are often unattainable or know the finish that has already been described in the past, when the problem has become more detailed: just a mobile stand with advertising move by a few meters and officials can put the previous call to remove the black advertiser into the basket.
That's because the authorities have to determine exactly where the illegal billboard is.
"If someone moves it and coordinates suddenly disagree, they look at it as a new device and we have to address the owner again," explains Jiří Klása.
The new law won't help.
The change could have been introduced by a new law which, since September next year, will ban billboards on highways and limit them on the I-class roads.
Critics point out that the rules for countering illegal and easily portable advertisements remain the same as they have ever been.
And the authorities won't get any better.
Firms can continue to earn tens of hundreds of millions of crowns a year on the leases of illegal areas and no one can afford them.
For example, the billboard running on Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know it well: the českobudujovická moistrate is currently running three administrative procedures for black billboards.
The company is in danger of three hundred thousand fines in each of the proceedings.
These are more advertisements that were placed without permission in the first class road safety zone.
Controls have not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mraz, head of the Czech Buděděvovska magistrate Transport Department.
The advert, which is of no interest to you at all, is not yet an option, but is likely to arrive soon.
According to spokeswoman ŘSD Nina Ledvinová, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case could be reached on the table by the regional and then by the magistrate officials.
Commerz Billboard belongs to those suspicious companies that can't be contacted.
She's not taking over the mail and the official headquarters in Žižkov has cancelled more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the company's mail went to the South Bohemian entrepreneur Anton Fischer, who heard a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech trade mark Hyundai.
Fischer, whose Euro Billboard is renting and offering areas to advertisers, has refused any link in the past.
In the spring of this year, when ŘSD started on the initiative of Aktuálno.cz interested in advertising on Lipno, Fischer had civil servants send a letter to his guest house for Commerz Billboard.
Even from this address, however, no one has heard from the highway administrators today.
It's not a fight.
Similar silent or opaque changes in the seats are not unusual.
One company was fined gradually for two million crowns a few years ago.
But she changed her name and ID and there was nothing to do with it.
The Executive returned the case, the commercials continued, perhaps at other places.
We are quite powerless against similar companies and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, confessing to one of the officials under the condition of anonymity.
No one has yet dealt with the new law in this regard.
Currently.cz spoke to several Members who took up the problem.
But they haven't developed any activity yet.
On the contrary, there were Members who wanted to extend the deadline for maintaining billboards on the main Czech communications.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are not only for national but also for regional and municipal policies very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topics.
On the one hand, they know about social demand after their limitations, on the other hand, they need them themselves for advertising in pre-election campaigns.
I don't stand for the rather established impression that if something doesn't work, then there's a need to change laws.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more rape and poppy, they estimate the statisticians.
According to estimates by the Czech Statistical Office, harvesting of cereals this year will be 6.7 per cent lower than last year.
Yet, this year’s harvest has exceeded the average in the last five to ten years.
On the other hand, the harvest of rape ( 3.9 percent) and poppy (2.5 percent) will be higher.
The harvest of cereals will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Farmers will harvest 7.2 million tons of grain.
This is based on an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office on 15 July.
The original estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and assumed a ten-point decline against last year.
But last year's harvest of cereals was above average.
This year's crop exceeds the average in the last five to ten years.
On the contrary, the harvest of rape and poppy will be higher this year.
Rape growers will harvest 3.9 percent more than a year ago when they received 1.256 million tons under the roof.
This year's poppy crop could be 2.5 percent higher than last year's.
The expected decrease in cereals production is due both to a decrease in hectare yield by 3.7 per cent to 5.71 tonnes per hectare, and to a fall in the iris area.
Farmers settled three percent less fields this year.
The winter wheat, which is the most important grain for the Czech Republic, is estimated to be 3.3 per cent less.
Farmers have also sent it to more fields.
However, the lower hectare yield, which will fall to 6.04 tonnes, will be signed on a decline.
About five-point decline is expected by statisticians in spring barley, which is most commonly used for the production of beer.
A reduction of 15.2 percent is worth reducing crop yields, as well as lower hectare yields.
On the contrary, the winter barley is born by 6.3 percent more.
The harvest of grain will also grow.
The rape crop is estimated to be 1,305 million tonnes, which is more against last year.
The iris spread by 7.3 percent.
Hectar yields, however, will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's crop of rape exceeds the ten-year average by 13.3 percent, with a third more extensive than 10 years ago.
In the last four years, there's also poppy fields.
This year, the farmers dropped him off on 35,543 hectares.
In 2008, when the poppy was grown on record 70,000 hectares in the Czech Republic, it is half a year.
This year’s poppy harvest will be richer thanks to the expansion of the iris.
It will rise to 2.5 percent last year at 27,423 tonnes.
Hectar yields, however, will be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouc officers accused two men of assault with a knife and a machete, the court sent them into custody.
The police accused two attackers who attacked a knife on Tuesday in downtown Olomouc and machete a 15-year-old man.
"Though the attacker tried to escape, they caused him severe and severe injuries that required hospital treatment and other treatment," said police spokesman Marie Štrbáková.
Both of the apparent perpetrators were arrested immediately after the attack by the police.
The applicant submitted a motion to the court for their detention and the court agreed on Friday.
Both men face three to ten years in prison.
Police officers charged two detained with assaulting a 15-year-old man in the centre of Olomouc with a knife and a machete.
The attackers caused him severe and severe injuries, the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people who took place on Tuesday, on the right noon of the Freedom class, the police said.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, informed the Olomouc police spokesman Marie Štrbáková.
A crowding match between the two families took place in the space of a garden outside the Tratoria Bar in the immediate vicinity of the center of Olomouc.
After aggressive word strife, two attackers attacked by a knife and machete of a man of five and thirty years.
Although the attacked man tried to escape, he suffered severe and severe injuries that required hospital treatment and other treatments, the police spokeswoman said.
In a raid that aroused great attention in the city center, which required several police patrols and guards to intervene on the ground, it was a family dispute.
Criminals of a 40-year-old man from Slovakia and a 7-year-old man from Olomouc accused him of trying to harm health and disorderly.
The applicant submitted a motion to the court to take them into custody and the court granted him a hearing on Friday, supplemented by a speaker.
The machete was also used in the center of Olomouc during a massive battle of attackers five years ago, at which time it was only a few dozen meters away, in front of Varna discotheque in Riegrova Street.
At that time, the police reported that a group of about ten foreigners with guns attacked the guests of the company who were standing outside the entrance.
According to the police, they had knives, clubs, and machetes in their hands.
The court then punished the two attackers with a suspended sentence.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you're walking around them every day.
One of the most screaming examples of unused and empty house is a vast building of former IPB headquarters in the middle of Sensitive Square.
It was supposed to work like a hotel a long time ago.
But it's still nothing.
Is it necessary to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolitan area?
What about using existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Right in the centre of Prague in the immediate vicinity of Václavské square is several ground-breaking houses, which, despite their location, size and often also monumental protection are empty and empty.
We selected properties in the center using the project Emptydomy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
Homes are usually victims of the financial problems of their owners, opaque relationships between companies, or belong to a state that cannot or does not want to get rid of them.
Empty homes are more than homeless in the Czech Republic.
Let the owners pay a special tax for them, wants an initiative.

Clinton's husband made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to publish his tax returns.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-president Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
More than a million dollars spent on charity for Clinton.
Most of Clinton's income -- over six million dollars -- is for their expressions.
Trump refuses to publish his tax returns.
US Democrats' candidate for Hillary Clinton's presidential office published its tax returns on Friday, raising the pressure on its Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-president Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year, announced AP.
Most of Clinton's revenue - over six million dollars - is for their speeches, mostly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton started her campaign before the elections.
The tax report showed that Clinton's spouses paid a federal income tax of 34.2% last year and then a government and local income tax of nine percent.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of the income on taxes.
But Trump has a problem with a similar step, so far he has not decided to publish a tax confession.
There's a certain possibility that Donald Trump doesn't pay any taxes at all, she wrote Clinton on twitter a few minutes after she published her confession.
Clinton repeatedly returns to secrecy around Trump's incomes, inter alia, in order to raise doubts as to whether her opponent is truly as rich as he claims, the AP said.
Trump's assets are estimated at billions of dollars.
Lower earnings would damage the reputation of a Republican candidate as a successful entrepreneur.
Senator Tim Caine, who has been running for the vice president in tandem with the former first lady, has today published a report on his tax deductions in the last ten years.
Together with their wife, Anne Holton, they paid 7.5 percent of their charity income and paid 25.6 percent of their income to the tax last year.
In Nigeria, a turn-on broke out again.
Islamists from Boko Haram defended a consistent vaccination and killed doctors.
Children's defenses have re-emerged in Nigeria.
In the northeastern part of the country, the government declared an emergency vaccination because there were two children infected with this disease who had been contaminated.
Vaccinations brought in helicopters.
Islamic terrorists from Boko Haram were active in the affected area, who defended and even killed doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there was an undetected collapsing virus.
In the northeastern part of Nigeria, an emergency vaccination of children against weapons is initiated, as two children infected with this disease have been contaminated there.
In Africa, the defense was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that millions of children and four million more will be found in the State of Borno in the surrounding countries.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday, according to AP, quickly delivered infant arms vaccines to the affected northeastern part of the country where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram are active.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has indicated that the virus has been undetected for many years.
Extremists from Boko Haram have in the past defended vaccination and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also prevented doctors from reaching areas where children with guns were found on Thursday.
Both affected battalions came with refugees from parts of Nigeria newly liberated from Boko Haram.
The director of the WHO section responsible for the dismantling of the defence Michel Zaffran station BBC said that vaccination in Nigeria would start next week.
In the state of Borno, the Islamic radical group Boko Haram acted for a long time.
The area was made available to the international organisation and the government until the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram managed to weaken in this part of the country in a fundamental way.
Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adevole admitted that the new cases of defense were a great disappointment for the country because Nigeria wanted to declare next year that the defense had been eradicated in it.
WHO pointed out that it is possible that although the disease did not occur for two years, it was still spreading among children.
Children under the age of five are now expected.
In 2012, Nigeria had half of the world's defence cases.
While in 1988 it was a defense in 125 countries, it now remains only in three areas - Afghanistan, Pakistan, and northern Nigeria.
The Pope met former prostitutes in Rome.
He was listening to the rotten stories of the fallen women.
Pope Frantisek met with twenty former prostitutes who had escaped from the gang of pimps thanks to the police.
The pope listened to their difficult life stories and called on them to look to the future with confidence.
František wanted to draw attention to trafficking in human beings and to call for a stronger fight against them.
Pope Frantisek met with 20 former prostitutes in Rome, who the police set free from the power of a pimp gang.
The head of the Catholic Church listened for more than an hour to the moved stories of the fallen women and then urged them to look to the future with confidence, put the speaker in the Vatican.
Among the former prostitutes that Frantisek visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All were subjected to cruel physical violence during forced prostitution, according to the Vatican.
In his visit František wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for a stronger fight against it, said the pope's spokesman.
Frantisek often draws attention to the fates of people on the outskirts of society.
On Thursday, for example, he lunched with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican this April and in June because of his personal invitation.
France's going to hit the jihadists' factories.
But without the help of the Muslims, it will not work.
In the fight against radical Islam, France is helping the Muslims themselves.
In addition, Prime Minister Manuel Vallse's government is about to make major changes in the functioning of mosques and spiritual education.
Since December last year, we have closed 20 mosques and prayer feasts.
And others will follow, announced the Minister of the Interior.
There are over a hundred jihadists in the country.
"If the Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee that freedom," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, it aims to ensure that only imams who were educated in France preach in mosques and prayer halls.
At the same time, he wants to stop financing mosques from abroad.
Currently comes from abroad about 20 percent of the money for the construction of new mosques, most of Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
Even so, preachers who can spread radicalism in France get into the mosques.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," the Prime Minister added.
The key to meeting these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should function as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more foreign money.
The French Foundation for Islam is now in operation in the country, founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
The Foundation had already had to contribute to the review of the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that financed their construction.
But the institutions soon affected internal divisions and rivalry.
"It's a total failure," said Vals recently.
In the French political scene, after the attack on the journal Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, there was a debate over a new institution that would replace the functional foundation.
All were speeded up by further terrorist attacks in France, which in the name of the Islamic State carried out the traitorous Islamists.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently heard that the new foundation will be established in October this year.
It will have two main tasks - ensuring the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also overseeing the imams.
For the time being, it is not clear where the money will be taken not only for the construction of new mosques, but also for various educational centers.
However, several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or tax for haling food.
Here, in practice, the sellers would pay meals to provide certification.
Part of that money would then travel right to the foundation's money.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros (270 to 540 CZK) could then be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year, there are about 30,000 going to Saudi Arabia on a traditional pilgrimage.
But not just that.
According to the prime minister, in the mosques in the future, only preachers who have been through special educational programs at French universities should be active.
This should ensure that preaching is in line with democracy.
We'll close the radical mosques.
At the same time, the French government is running against radicals.
And others will follow, recently announced the Minister of the Interior.
In France, there is no place for those who declare hatred in mosques and do not respect certain principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
It is estimated that about 2,500 mosques and prayerben work in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islam.
Since 2012, the authorities have exhausted about 80 imams and are considering this for several other decades.
Not all think that government action can significantly affect radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
This is not the case in mosques, young people radicalise on the Internet, says Severine Labatová, an expert at the National Centre for Scientific Research.
Dear Kelemen lost his first round of sprint with the star Baugem.
The Czech track cyclist must be involved in repairing the procedure to the eight-final.
Dear cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, after the sprint qualification process among the best eighteen he lost in the 1st round with French giant Grégory Baugem, defender of silver from past games in London.
The procedure up to the eight-finals must be involved in the repairs.
27 riders were built to begin royal discipline on the track, and the best Czech tracker of the day was assigned the best 14 times.
Two years from now, it was 9.969 seconds.
In the main cutting-off phase, he was waiting for him in the fifth Baugé qualification, which he already has from Ria Bronz in the team sprint.
Although he was finally touching an experienced Frenchman, he kept the procedure under control.
A great performance with the defense attorney, Jason Kenny.
The 18th-year-old Brit took the third fastest two hundred years of history and won the Olympic record of 9,551.
He was then able to deal with the last progressive one, the German Maximilian Levy, as he expected.
There was also a British quartet composed of Bradley Wiggins, which in the 4 km race took the new world record 3:50,570 and entered the finale.
To date, the maximum number (3:51,659) that the British had four years since the London Olympics has improved by more than a second.
Young Doctors Push: They Want Fresh Wind in the Field · Global Voices
Young doctors gathered to approve new steps in their new contract dispute.
The Board of Young Physicians (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) must request the full Council to support further branch activities from early September.
The JDC says the ministers were unable to resolve the issues concerning the contract.
Young doctors and medical students in July voted against the contract agreed with BMA.
58 % of its members who participated in the elections were rejected.
In a letter to the members published Thursday night on Twitter, President Ellen McCourt said that the government remained "and still silent" on issues, which led to the rejection of the contract.
She said: “In this light, the executive authority of the JDC decided, by voting, to reject completely the proposed new treaty and to request new formal negotiations on all matters.”
In response to government silence today, the Executive Board of the JDC formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve the running programme of won sectoral events from early September.
This year, the dispute led young doctors to declare up to six strikes, including the first general strikes in the history of NHS.
The young doctor’s leader in BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned following a decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract that BMA recommended.
The BMA members at the pre-vote meetings before 54,000 young doctors and medical students said that the agreement was good and should be adopted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health said the contract would mean a burden for medics in England.
Russia and Turkey: 'Incompatible' Alliance?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to take their hands and announce the formal end of eight months of long-term verbal war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimír Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart to the palace's fancy hall in St Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There's been a hand-off, yes.
But Putin didn't smile, and he barely seemed to express warmth, even according to his measured standards.
On the contrary, Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his “loving friend” Mr Putin - five times, as one of the reports state.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their level before the crisis, but would be even better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers said that Erdogan was acting like nothing bad ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm was the opposite.
But the persistent cold that radiated from Putin showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: the shooting of a Russian combat aircraft by Turkey at the Syrian borders.
Moscow's reaction was furious back then.
Putin was handing out wounds to himself, and he accused Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The deterioration was greater than the thought of losing a friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has changed since December as well.
The state-controlled media for months led a massive global campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly it looked like the Turks could do anything.
More serious was the charge by top state officials that Erdogan's own family benefited from illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied this.
But in St Petersburg, there was an official message that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared some kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
In the first place, Erdogan was last month during a failed coup almost deprived of power and therefore needs all his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have had a severe impact - above all the cancellation of charter flights that transport several million Russian tourists each year to the coast of Turkey.
This figure has been reduced by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, the tour operators and charter companies here will really breathe when, if possible, flights are restored.
They make money on Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruit and vegetables until once again the imports of agricultural commodities from Turkish territory were allowed.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as reported in the Vedevo newspaper.
But the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it sees as a shame to react to a coup attempt.
In addition, the long-term non-response prolonged talks about EU entry and Putin's entry - which is eager to exploit and break Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points when Ankara asked for the assistance of the elected authorities after attempting a coup.
You must understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-rooted fear of changing the regime, it is given.
So the summit in this pumped, sea palace of Russia and Turkey allowed me to demonstrate what one analyst described as “a partnership of incompatible”: how they combine the forces of two countries that feel rejected and exploited by the West.
However, despite the public display of reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently played a role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey stand on the opposite sides.
It could be said that, after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents at the press conference said that they had not even mentioned this question.
The Turkish President deliberately answered the question of the differences between them, while Putin decided to raise these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis that both states could find common ground on Syria's question.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of a total disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter aircraft - it is certainly better that both leaders speak at least once again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the Executive Director of the Bank, the RBS brand is to be pushed back office.
Royal Bank of Scotland is lost to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland station that the RBS brand was linked to the global ambitions of the bank.
She was relieved when eight years ago she almost disappeared and had to be redeemed from her debt.
At that time, strategic brands used “RBS” to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was followed by millions of pounds spent on sponsoring international sport, from the Six Nations football championship to the Winbledom champion Andy Marraye.
Now, however, it was decided that it was better to give more prominence to national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used for Scottish customers, but will not run new stores.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of centrals and stock coding on the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that get more to the front - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
While traveling to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered Ross McEwan's questions.
The BBC Scotland said: "The RBS sign will cease to be our brand and brand for which our employees work, because we are now becoming a much more branded bank."
Because the bank itself became a global brand, it became a global brand and RBS.
Now I'm saying we don't have global aspirations anymore, we have domestic-oriented efforts.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsoring of the Six Nations Championship, it has prepared a profile of the various brands of sport sponsoring.
"The time has come for us to move to the bank of brands, because the basic issue (which we ask) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers?" said the Executive Director.
Three years ago, it would be very cynical if we said we'd become a great customer bank and introduce those brands.
But together with how we focused on customer needs, and not on our own, I think there are a lot of changes.
We can reminisce these signs, I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on a horse Predilection led to target 3000. winner
Dettors spray champagne after a double victory in Newmarket brought him 3,000 victories
Jockey Frankie Detti made 3,000 wins in Britain in Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone was won by his second victory of the evening on his local track - on the horse Predilection, which John Gosden is training.
Five-year-old Italy is the sixth jake to achieve this result in a level approach.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The triple champion of the Detori check, who had won the Ghayyar horse, said: "It's strange."
I'm very touched because my family is here too.
I'm extremely glad that this happened in Newmarket because I just docked here 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not Royal Ascot - it's Friday night on Earth with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved, and I'm very grateful.
Detori collects congratulations when he brings Predilection after victory
Two jockeys of this milestone reached the obstacle course - the Richard Johnson Jockey Champion and the 20-fold champion of Sir Anthony McCoy, who, during his career, broke records, led to the goal of more than 4,300 winners.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and is no surprise that he reached a milestone that only a few riders had before him.
He's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical fistron that distinguishes him from the other riders in the scale.
He is a fantastic race ambassador, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans to this sport for many years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he didn't just ride weekends and big races, he'd have 6,000 winners!
But the truth is Frankie was driving a winner in the UK for most of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He has a live character, which is good for the British racing sport, but more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous summer jump
From summer finishes after summer skiing - Frankie Detti was the messenger of British flat racing for two decades.
It was like riding on a mountain track.
Unobtrusive number of winners of major races, including his famous “big seven” in Ascot. He also survived a plane crash and had a drug ban.
Three years ago, he staggered for the first time when he returned after a six-month ban on the launch, but he proved incredible inner strength and all the doubters had returned in the best form.
And maybe it won't be the last time - Detectives said he'd like to continue racing for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin released the head of the presidential office Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin released Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the presidential office on Friday.
Ivanov was one of the closest Putin associates for many years.
The 39-year-old Ivanov was appointed Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin "released Ivan from his services the head of the Russian presidential office", but no reason was given.
His place will be taken by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012.
Four-four-year-old Vajno was a diplomat earlier.
Born in the capital of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, he promoted at the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo embassy.
On the website (Russian) it is stated that he later made the head of the Presidential Protocol and the Presidential Office.
When he appointed Putin, he said, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities of the Head of State in terms of the draft of laws and the control of the extent to which your instructions are followed.
Putin told the Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to be released from his post and recommended that he replace it with Vajno.
Are they going to convince the smiles?
This step was completely mystified by Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest collaborators for a long time and as Putin worked for KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcasting state television, both men said he was leaving the post of head of the presidential office at his own request.
But only a few people were convinced by the smiles on the cameras - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So this is about the consequence of some struggle for power?
Nobody knows that yet.
But the official argument that a man once thought of as a possible president is suddenly seeking to lead Russia's environmental policy was met with great distrust.
The Kremlin’s website quotes Putin’s comments, in which Ivanov states: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you to give me this very difficult post, even a problematic post, to trust for four years.
Apparently, I've been president of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He had previously served as Vice-President of the Government and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and worked for the State Security Committee (KGB) before Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was in charge of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced KGB, Ivanov was appointed his representative.
When Putin came into power, he appointed Ivan as one of his five closest associates.
There was even speculation that Ivan could become the successor of Putin in the head of the state after his second election period, since the third period would be counter-constitutional for Putin.
This post, however, was taken over by another close associate of Putin Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later before returning to the presidency.
Thomas Gibson, the star of the Criminal Thought series, was released after he hit the director.
Gibson got involved in a physical exchange of views on the scene last month in Los Angeles.
The ABC and CBS TV stations that produce the series announced its release in a joint declaration.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his release.
There have been creative differences on the scene and disagreements.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in a statement.
According to the ABC and CBS TV stations, details of how Gibson's character disappears from a series that monitors the stories of a team of FBI agents a little later.
The four-year-old actor, celebrated in sitcom Dharma and Greg, played the series since the first series in 2005.
"I love the thoughts of a criminal, and over the last 12 years, I have put hearts and souls into them," Gibson stated in his statement, which he published on Friday.
I was hoping I'd be in it till the end, but now it won't be possible.
I would like to express my thanks to the authors, the producers, the actors, our amazing team and, above all, the great fans that this show could hope for.
The return of the series to the twelfth series is expected on 28 September.
In Banff city, mysteriously landed in a garden of fish
A man from Banff asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish may be sandeels left there by the water smother.
Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, published on the Periscope channel a short film of his finding in the belief that someone could help him explain how about a five-centimeter fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now connects with Fife
The € 1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
The engineers connected the northern platform and Queensferry Crossing and viaduct - the bridge now connects with Fife.
It is therefore the first of the four closures among the “beasters of the platform ” that are now almost finished around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
Part of the Fife bridge is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tonnes of iron and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 pivot ropes.
The EUR 1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017.
The economic secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment of the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we are all witnessing how construction engineers have used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive dimensions and weight of the bridge, the closure between the viadukt and the area of the delicate operation bridge required extraordinary accuracy.
There is now a total of more than 79% of the total area of the bridge, concrete for the last part of the platform is now poured in Rosyth, so the whole platform is ready to lift to the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first closure of each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents a peak of ground construction.
After installing the last part of the road platform and its connection to the expanding North Tower platform, we had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by stretching the northern approach viaduct 700 millimeters in the south direction.
This was a massive and simultaneously very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and has to be pulled up by about 3%.
Delicious because the tolerances with which the team worked were very small - only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are “happy to be alive”
Three men are "happy to be alive" after the water drained from their fishing boat at Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station reported an alarm on Friday at 13:20 British summer time after a crew incident in the Moelfre Bay saw.
All three men tried to swim to safety while their boat continued unruly.
"We saw their boat orbiting in their vicinity and the worst occurred to us," said the rescue boat driver Moelfre Vince Jones.
"A strong wind has driven him away from them before we left," he added.
Two men saved a local fishing ship, a third man at the age of 60 was found without a life jacket worn out as he was holding the fight.
They were all delivered aboard a coast rescue boat and taken back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said: “The three men are happy to be put into the water, alive and completely unharmed.
The engine of the ship had an emergency cable, but somehow there was a disconnect from the person who drove the boat when there was a coup.
Someone up there was holding a guard hand over those guys.
The judge refuses to handle the case because of Tulchor's wife.
Peter Tuchor is one of the three MPs who, according to the prosecution, were to get from Prime Minister of the Times and his then chiefs of cabinet Jana Nagy's political strike, i.e. a lucrative post for political retreat.
In 2012, the tax package was approved.
Snyder, Fuksa, and Fatso have allowed him to resign.
Then they appeared on influential posts in state companies.
That is why they also faced suspicions of bribery and ended up in custody for a month.
However, according to the court, almost 2 million crowns were found to be indemnified.
The fat man is now acting in bail as a witness after the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a courthouse on the Fruit Market and solves civil disputes.
However, she wants to be a judge, Helena Královová (solves criminal matters - see para.) and to avoid possible objections.
The case is likely to be taken over by another Prague courthouse.
The king has already forgiven Jan Netime twice, before Nagy.
It was an alleged misuse of military intelligence to track the first wife of Prime Minister Radka.
In this case, the Fat Man didn't make a difference.
According to Jaroslav Ortman's lawyer, this is an unnecessary overreaction.
I think that impartiality cannot be interpreted so as to exclude the court if the witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid nothing could be judged at all, marked for a journal.
"It looks like it's gone," he added.
In the case of political strikes, Roman Boček, a former official, is also charged.
According to his attorney, Peter Toman would have had a chance to succeed.
The District Court for Prague 1 discussed the charges against former Chief of Staff of Prime Minister Peter Nečas Jany Nagyová (now the Nečasová) and other accused of causation of the use of military intelligence.
There's a Timeless man and his husband coming to court.
The fat guy was supposed to deal with Peroutka's statements.
For example, the ex-wife was to judge President Miloš Zeman's statements about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutkov.
Zeman claimed to be sympathetic to Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl apparently died in an air raid by allied forces.
She and her two old friends flew to Syria last year in February from Gatwick Airport in London.
The British Ministry of the Interior did not comment on her death.
The young Londoners who fled home were reportedly smuggled to Syria across the Turkish border.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana were targeted by the media for their other former schoolmate, Bethnal Green Academy, London.
Last year’s case sparked a huge wave of attention and tension between Britain and Turkey.
British security forces estimate that some 600 British Muslims, some 50 young women and girls, have traveled to Syria so far.
A number of them joined radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home represent a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dream work for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Great paid work you don't even need in college.
That's the first look at the A.T. job.
And often for the other one.
The advantage is not only on the Czech ratios of extremely high pay (you will earn up to CZK 180 000 in Prague) but also extreme benefits.
The reason is a huge lack of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
It is estimated that nearly 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
Among the most sought-after are Grafton's staff statistics, programmers, developers, net engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
Therefore, the candidates do not contest the position, but the position of candidates, comments Jitka Součková, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
High school's not a necessity.
High-school education is not necessary for hystericals.
High-school education means a good foundation and is the overall indicator of intelligence and education of the candidate, but often does not have much in common with the knowledge of development.
The developers must constantly learn new things, which one student will not replace, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Carer CZ.
The best thing to do in Prague is to make money.
The wages of the Aytians are high above the Republic's average.
Most of the money will come to Prague and Brno, there is no such rush in the regions.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," says Cubak.
Technical directors will achieve the highest wage.
In Prague and Brno you can come to 120 000 - 180 000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but there is not much less than CZK 80 000.
Demands are also IT project managers.
When entering, they can earn 60,000 - 100,000 CZK.
It's also about graduates.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the office of work, it is not true for the aytians.
Because if companies get overdressed and recharged by an expert from another company, they like to reach out to a graduate.
They can raise him according to their own way.
They won't come out without a tongue.
Knowledge of a foreign language fits in every profession, but it is necessary for the Ayats to have a minimum of decent English.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is necessary in some IT positions.
On the other hand, we are faced with the number of cases where companies are looking in particular for an educated and experienced person and are satisfied only with the average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, a support worker controls more foreign speech, he is interesting to his employer because he is able to serve more customers from different countries, the director of Cubačka adds.
Yoo in Google, there's paradise.
Only silently envy can Czech employees in Google.
Of course, for them there is a flexible working time, the possibility of working from home or various reduced relationships, not just for moms.
"It gives the new-born dads an extra four weeks' leave after the birth of the baby," says Martina Jones, spokesman for Google.
Hiccup also includes health care for employees and family, eating, transport, training, wellness or massages directly in the workplace.
Whoever wants to learn has green and doesn't care what they want to learn.
But that's not the end of the benefits.
Such a full refrigerator for free is certainly not to be thrown away.
Healthy lunch (in some places and breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called microkitchens in all offices, where people always find a healthy snack, betrays the speaker.
And in order for nothing to be thrown out, what it doesn't eat, it puts in boxes that employees can take home tonight.
And the reasons for these on the Czech ratios of incredible benefits?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"It is not important for Google that employees sit in the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, movement or development, ideas and innovative solutions," the speaker adds.
The UN has severely criticised Bulgaria for criminalising refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalising refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government 'causes serious concern about Bulgaria's non-compliance with international law', warned Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein in a statement.
He noted that "it is particularly disturbing to be a witness to how important and influential public figures express public support for the criminal armed militants that train refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey."
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross in Bulgarian territory are automatically arrested," Zeid stressed.
What is worse - they are often prosecuted and imprisoned for a year or longer - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including his own.
Bulgaria detained 14,000 migrants last year for the same period of 21,000.
Pokémon Go - the pursuit of health and happiness that pays
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
Over the past decade, a number of people have lamented that teenagers and children are no longer playing outdoors and prefer spending their free time in front of the screens.
Pokémon takes the people out of the couches and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screens was originally snorted on TV, later on on video games and the latest on smart phones.
It's great to watch that technology and activities outside are not mutually exclusive.
I am talking, of course, about the fashion that Pokémon Go is, an application based on the characters that appeared for the first time in video games at the end of the 1990s (later there was a cartoon series, playing cards and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, this new game took place before the introduction in early July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
The introduction in other countries was then postponed due to the powerful interest that led to the overload of the servers.
Pokémon Go has gained more users in a few days than Tinder and almost as many users as he has Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players on the smart phone go out looking for the Pokémons who follow them via GPS, and when they find them, they can “take them out” (through the screenshot on the phone) or “ capture them”.
Mania stunned the generation that at the younger age played the game, picked her up from the seats and married her to look for Pokémons.
In the United States, this game has resulted in a marked increase in the number of steps that a “average” person takes every day.
The App Cardigram for Smart Watch from Apple, which monitors 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of starting the game, the number of people monitored every day for 30 minutes jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who Pokémon Go is playing - sees only rough data about the levels of exercise.
Many public campaigns to “find 30, ”“ rose from the couch ” and “have been active every day” have fallen into barren soil, because most of the messages on public health are boring and destined for people who do not look well.
However, the importance of exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who practice regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that we cannot fully state here.
But the beauty of Pokemon's game is that people go out and do something that's fun.
You cover three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunlight, and fun.
Some people even get new friends in the pursuit of penance.
As is true of course, such boring patrons will find themselves looking for any excuse to complain.
And, yes, someone can walk in the door.
What, like?
There's been a breakthrough.
In their time, applications for smart phones, such as Fitbit, could monitor our activity, but they gave us no reason to do anything like this in this game.
The news is watching and interest in it starts to decline at some point.
However, thanks to the success of the Pokémons, there will be other games that will combine applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world and help a number of people in pursuit of activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles has won gold in multiple gymnastics women
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jump.
No effort on the hammer.
They were all fooled by the simplest.
Excellent in everything.
And now finally an Olympic champion.
On Thursday, the 19 - year - old American gymnast went straight to the title of the multi-fight and the others to the full lines under the Olympic reflectors overcame.
The overall result 62,198 clearly confirmed her headship in front of the silver medalist and member of the team "final fives" by Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Bilesová (USA) during a performance on Thursday at the hammer in the finals of the multiplayer fight in the sports gymnast at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in the Brazilian Rio de Janeiro.
Biles became the fourth American in a row, which won the multi-battery, and the fifth overall, when she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps even the best at all.
When her overall final score was on the table and her long journey was over until this moment, tears appeared to her face.
This success ranks her into the same league of unique athletes of her time, such as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, won 15 medals at world championships - including 10 gold ones. Her impressive compositions are mixed ambitions and accuracy and the 1984 Olympic Champion Mary Lou Retton described her as "the best gymnast she's ever seen."
The last test was waiting for her in Brazil, not even between Biles and the rest of the racers, but between herself and the burden of too much expectations.
Anything other than going home to your family in Spring Texas with a hand full of gold medals would be viewed as a disappointment.
Simone Bilesová (USA), left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning the gold and silver medals in the final of the women's multi-fight singles at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in the Brazilian Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The first Biles won Tuesday, when she was as a screamer at Martha Caroly's National Team Coordinator's party.
Bilesova insists that she never looked forward during her long trip to the top, which is not exactly true.
Part of its composition in simple - the one which contains for it a typical triple salad with a double turnover - is planted in Latin music that would just come home to the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as bats, and her talent was discovered by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman on the way to the gym where Boorman trained and gained strength.
The multi-fight has not lost since 2013 - this is the result of a victory that can continue for as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafin took the lead briefly, thanks to two twists, it was just an illusion.
Order and simple - where Biles defends the world championship - waiting.
She got back in line with 15,433 points for the hammer - and scored 15,933 points in the spares.
Raisman gave her a soft hug when they were waiting for the final score - just the formality - and around the sparkly red, white and blue shadows, the Biles came to tears when the wishes, which she once wrote into her diary, were fulfilled.
Raisman's performance was kind of a payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she was sharing a third line with Mustafin, but then a bronze for the sum of three best compositions.
This time the twenty-first-year-old captain of the team, who Americans call a "grandmother," was quite forward.
She sent a crowd of air kisses after her simple ones, capable of returning, which seemed sometimes uncertain.
For Biles, this 19-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where he became a total hit, a completely new meaning:
Police: Three victims in a serial killer were shot while listening to music in the car
According to a police report published on Thursday, two women died and a girl 12 years old during the most important attack of decades, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot while sitting in the car, talking and listening to music.
The authorities announced that Angela Rochelle Linerová, Stefanie R. Ellisová and daughter Ellis Maleah were shot in a car parked on the driveway on 12 June.
The report states that the armed man was on the side of the passenger and fired eight shots from the handarm and then fled in another vehicle.
According to the police, he doesn't want a three-fold murder robbery because the attacker didn't take his wallets, or the $2,900 that one of the adult victims had on him.
Phoenix P.D., Sergeant Jonathan Howard said that investigators were investigating whether the shooting had any connection with any of the previous four attacks.
In the two mostly Hispanic districts, nine attacks occurred within four months, killing seven people and wounding two others.
"It's happening in the villa quarter before houses," Howard said earlier this month for the branch of KPHO station CBS.
Police believe the suspect was using several cars, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was taken to a hospital where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Liner (31) and Ellis Maleah's daughter died on the spot.
The Witness told the police that it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, whose target was empty delivery just half an hour before the triple murder, and the police believe that the serial killer was its origin.
Investigators found casings and from the rest of the bullets in the seat and assembled a bullet from under the hood of the engine.
Mother of a six-year-old with microcephalia: “His condition is improving”
Edmund Picciato, like most children of his age, loves singing, toys and, of course, also her mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephalia, a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, the first time I thought I wouldn't make it.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - of course you're ready for it," she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, have learned that Edmund may never know them and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in the institution.
"My first reaction was that I thought people weren't doing this anymore," Picciut explains.
Edmund's dating with a walker.
Until he was three years old, he couldn't sit and crawl, and he still doesn't talk.
Some limits are already slowly filling in.
He goes with help and rides a bike.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and loving singing.
Elizabeth speaks sign language, using which Edmund says, "Please sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciut said for CBS News.
But it's not a common sign - it says Edmund invented some characters himself.
Microcephaly can come from a number of different states: genetics, as in the case of Edmund, and infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as bedrooms or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It is too soon to tell what effect the Zika virus will have on the lives of those infected.
Picciut reminds her of a sentimental tax she chooses for an uncertain future.
I keep asking, "What's next?"
What's next?
And he's still not sure about that.
In fact, I never asked what the total prognosis is, because I don't expect anyone to tell me at all.
Picciutová, however, has an encouraging report for mothers of all children who suffer from congenital defects caused by Zika's virus.
The situation is getting better.
Make sure it's better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and floods demanded rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and extensive flooding in Louisiana caused the governor to declare an emergency on Friday. Another rain is expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Meteorological Service (NWS) reported that after extreme lilacs, a number of rivers on the south-east of Louisiana and in southern Mississippi will spill out of their shores and threaten a vast flood.
Governor Louisiana John Bel Edwards said that civil servants are constantly in contact with local authorities and that aid is already on its way to affected areas.
Mike Steele, the governor's spokesman for national security and preparedness for the crisis, said they were receiving requests for vehicles for water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that only the Tangipaho district asked for 10,000 bags of sand.
The flood patrols will stay in most of southern Louisiana to work on Saturday.
In the declaration, the meteorological service indicated that it could spray some 8 to 13 centimetres above the sea.
In southern Alabama there was a flood patrol on Friday, when the rains continued in the area of Mobile.
According to predictions, the Comite Rivers at Baton Rouge and Amite at Denham Springs have a culmination weekend.
Meteorologist Alec Krautmann said that both sayings could flood many houses in suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He added that the floods after the current in the session area were dangerous, when these dilute streams would only be poured out slowly into the Maurepas Lake.
Tickfaw River, a little souther than the Mississippi State of Liverpool in Louisiana, reached the highest levels of local time on Friday at 9 a.m. on Friday morning.
Rescuers are still picking up people from the Baywaters in the counties of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife, and his stepdaughter, were already on Fridays among those who were injured in Gloster.
Hansford, 62, said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 metres from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said he was warned by his next step son, who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was approaching," Hansford said.
We had it all the way to the waist.
According to his wife, it's the highest level she's ever had on a river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said he and all his family are disabled and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford stated that crisis workers had saved all three huge military-style trucks and transported them to a fire station in Gloster, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said that as rains continue to rain, floods are “quickly spread” and authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone announced that from midnight to Friday morning 35 centimeters of rain rain fell.
Krautmann said the land has been heavily drained since Wednesday.
The authorities stated that the rain and the roads paid had required the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipaho district and the abolition of teaching in five school districts.
The branch office of the WWL station CBS announced that 200 homes were flooded from Tangipagoa in the early days.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, which are both but now flooded.
The mayor of the village of Robby Miller stated that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals that had been trapped by the high water.
In the village of Amite and in Hammond, shelters were set up for those who were evacuated.
"They will be able to return home when the water starts to fall," he said.
In the Tangipahoa district of Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed because of the floodwaters, and locals were provided with sand bags that they could pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
"The last great floods were here in March," said the city administrator Lacy Landrum.
These floods seem to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, director of the Crisis Situation in Harrison County, Mississippi, said that the rain was continuing on the coast of the Persian Gulf.
He said that on Thursday a couple of houses had been reported drowning, but on Friday none of them showed up.
Keith Townson, Head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in several places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "a boy shot like a gun," survived the shooting in Philadelphia
According to the police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, and this week it's the second shooting of a child at the age of six in the city.
The grandparents identified him as Mahaye Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents say the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including weakness, legs, arms and abdomen, but he was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
"He grabbed a lot of it, his little body was shot down like a gun," said his grandmother Delores Melendez's station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family for the station said the boy should get better.
He was supposed to go to the first grade of primary school.
Mahaj Brown is among the four people who were shot in Germantown.
Three more men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the men at the age of 29 is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia there are two more stabilized victims.
According to the station's report, a child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a nine-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police were looking into whether any of the wounded men could be the shooter.
Investigators at CBS Philadelphia reported that there was probably a shooting between several armed men.
On site, shells of an assault type were found, belonging to a variety of attack weapons.
Apparently, it was definitely a continuing battle.
There were shells on the street on both sides of the sidewalk.
So it seems that there were a number of armed fighters who were actively involved," said the captain of the Philadelphia police of Anthony Ginaldi for the station.
Several homes and vehicles were also hit in the area.
No one's been arrested, and the police are allegedly investigating video footage from the cameras.
Another six-year-old, this time a girl, was shot in the arms by a stray shot Tuesday in front of a house in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
The girl recovers and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
This is how I imagine a women's team of gymnasts for this year's Olympics, for a number of reasons.
First, I've been to every summer Olympic since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, there are three gymnasts in this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which complements Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
Finally, we have a team that looks like America.
He also strengthened the presence of blacks and Latin Americans on the top of this sport.
The number one gymnast in the past four years has been African American.
Simone and Gabby were on the first and second line last year.
That means something.
At the last olympic, Gabby Dougals suddenly became the champion of the Olympic Games and America cheered.
Now the world could have witnessed the incredible performance of the three-fold world winners Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who demonstrated the unexpected but masterly gymnastics figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in a woman's multiple battles.
And a member of the Aly Raisman team got the silver.
We're at the top of the sport, but in gym classes in the country, it doesn't look like it.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie took the same path as Aly and Madison in the Olympic team.
They are the “final five” because the team of gymnasts at the next Olympics will consist of only four athletes, and this is the last year Marta Karolyi trains.
The reality is, however, that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnasts train mainly in private gymnasts that maintain parents who pay for training, equipment, roads, jerseys, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their confidants and families).
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in the suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all the training and for the families of gymnasts and gymnasts it is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles's coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez's coach, both trained athletes at the time they started high school.
It is our duty to bring gymnast training, which are more accessible and accessible communities of countless young girls, whom Simone, Gabby and Laurie inspired.
I founded the Gymnastics Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free gymnastics or low costs in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (mainly Black and Hispanic) and we trained national and international champions.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means life benefits for good health, success at school and at work.
The inspiration of this team will be sent to us by thousands of young girls who want to do gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for proving "girlpower" and winning the Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to become healthy, strong and successful young women on the road.
Following the rejection of Jeremy Hunt’s proposal, young doctors are ready to enter the next strike
The ministers hoped that, after the revised contract had been concluded, representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would end their disagreements about changes, but 58 percent of the 37 000 young doctors who had taken part in the election rejected the contract.
Hunt discovered plans in July to force a contract with NHS being in "no country" and another delay would have a detrimental impact on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract that includes changes in night and weekend work procedures to improve care in non-social hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Commission for Young Physicians, said in a statement last night: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that the current labour crisis and the fair treatment of all doctors are on the rise.”
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors passes under a new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through negotiations have met with reluctance to engage the doctor and often with the deafening silence of the government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this possibility is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt now has to act, push for coercion and resolve the concerns of young doctors."
If this does not happen, young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed, as nurses and specialists were called to join doctors who were among the protesters.
The ministers hoped that, following the conclusion of the revised contract, the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would conclude disagreements concerning changes.
BMA wants higher pay for a weekend job for 54,000 young doctors who would be subject to a contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of NHS employers, called on young doctors not to enter any strikes.
Mortimer said: “The action will only achieve little or nothing, but there will be pressure on the already overloaded teams and services and raise fears, exhaustion and disturbances for patients, nurses and their families. ”
In the past two months, we have dealt with the Board of Young Physicians and with the Ministry of Health and others have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervisor and informant.
Employees hoped that continuing positive involvement in other important issues - such as burden, flexibility in training, further training for those who return after career interruption, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study freedom and gender pay gap - was evidence of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health are taking agreements that were reached in November, February and May with BMA.
60 crowns a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients who are at risk of heart attacks will be able to take a drug that costs about 60 crowns (two pounds). The authorities recommend that they administer it to more patients for longer periods.
The cure for blood clotting Ticagrelor lowers the risk of seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now administered for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or other seizures.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the medicine be administered to humans for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people will suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them will suffer another stroke or stroke.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by a buildup of fat that creates a related layer on the walls of the artery.
If this layer is severed, a blood clot may occur, blocked blood flow to the heart, and a heart attack may occur.
If the clot relaxes, the bloodstream may continue, block the blood supply into the brain and cause the stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are exposed to a higher risk of another seizure.
Ticagrelor, which manufactures the British company AstraZeneca and which is sold under the commercial name Brilique, reduces the risk that the formation of clots is less likely.
In the proposal for a NACE directive published today, it is recommended that patients receive 90 mg Ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg together with aspirin twice daily for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there is a quarter of patients who had a heart attack and who will be affected by another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences.”
The fear of repetition may have a significant negative impact on the patient’s quality of life.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
It is a pleasure to have many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from Ticagrelor’s preliminary recommendation.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially about the risk of bleeding - above the three-year limit is limited, treatment over this period is not recommended in the proposal.
Computer culture has begun to flourish fraud in Muslim areas
Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was withdrawn from office last year for corruption, which was linked to the government report
The culture of political correctness has led to the neglect of widespread fraud in Muslim communities, according to the government's report today.
Ex-Minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticizes the police, electoral inspectors and the council for ignoring the use of voters because of "the hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
The earlier secretary of the community, now ruler of anti-corruption interventions, said that the intimidation of voters based on their religion is so bad that the police should make cordons and guard tightened voters from the elections.
He recommended that the voters take with them a document of identity and prove who they were when they were elected.
At present, voters just specify their name and address.
In the report, it is further suggested that, when giving a voice, people should make irrefutable ink in order to avoid being voted twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, says Pickles.
It requests that the press be given more access to the documents of the session and to decisions adopted by non-official committees or working groups.
"It is not only protection against electoral fraud, but also protection of local governments from a wider corrupt environment and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report requested Downing Street as a result of an election scandal at Tower Hamlets in West London.
Last year, the special electoral court ruled, the mayor of Lutfur Rahman, should be withdrawn from his post after charges of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman “cynically affected” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his criticisms by accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
As Rahman said, "He led his campaign so that it would be a religious duty of devoted Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were questioned, or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and issues himself as someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed his special concern at the frauds in the correspondence vote - claimed by the older members of the Muslim community during it to exert pressure on people to vote for the candidates they had chosen.
Sir Eric, in the photo, gave several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including the submission of identity documents.
The report states: “He presented evidence that the vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, particularly women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, particularly in communities originating in Pakistan and Bangladesh.”
“There have been fears that... state institutions have closed their eyes to such behaviour due to “politically correct” hypersensitivity to ethnic origin and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including that political activists should not be allowed to manipulate the correspondence voices and thus prevent "voting."
The report, which is now evaluated by Theresa May, also requests more detailed controls in registrations to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and dose fraud.
Consider asking voters to submit an identity document before voting.
The use of indelible ink on the fingers of persons in voting to prevent a person from voting twice.
The implementation of systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that they can vote.
Request for automatic correspondence vote to be limited to three years.
Ban political agitators and activists to manipulate dedicated correspondence voices and electoral envelopes.
To give the police the authority to create around the cabinet's election rooms.
Amend the laws to make it easier to prosecute those who develop illegal pressure under the 1983 Reform Law.
No photos taken in the election rooms.
To require that only English (except Wales) work in the elections rooms.
Strengthen training and ensure that workers comply with the rule that voters go to the polls individually.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police and says it is “surprising” that no charges have been brought against the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent as a castor of corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty of any reasonable doubt - in the power of evidence of a crime.
It also criticises the irresistible "checking the cracking fields" in the polling department at the town hall.
Sir Eric said: “The decision of the court in the Tower Hamlets case is a wake - up call.
Our nation has a proud reference to the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some authorities threatens this reputation.
The cradle of the cyclist duo Kate and other twins of famous figures at the Rio Olympics
The fans of the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 went crazy this week in French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevotová, who is quite similar to the Duke of Cambridge.
But the 40-year-old olympic is not the only athlete this year seeking gold, who can boast of his own double from a number of well-known personalities - at least not according to social networks.
At the celebration of the Olympic Games in Rio and of all the known personalities that are currently appearing on our screens, the column for FEMAIL women has drawn up a list of olympics that are more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
As a hunting animal: A member of the American team of archers Brady Ellison (left) has been compared from tinyly to Leonard DiCaprio
In addition to the Kate doppelganger on the cycling track, a number of online people quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be the twin of the star Leonard DiCaprio.
A racer from the team of American archers Brady Ellison caused a storm on Twitter after his pictures of wolves from Wall Street appeared.
Brady himself noticed media madness and admitted that he had been hearing about his resemblance to Lee since he was a little girl.
"They don't see a big resemblance, except the beards," Brady said for Huffington Post.
"It's cool and looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be highlighted even more: the striking image between the British jump in the distance of Greg Rutherford and the favorite actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliy Mustafin with her big, distinctive eyes were said to be a copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been likened for years to the star of the Gel Matthew Morrison series.
And for a change: User thinks Nathan is a "athletic" actor from the film Beginning (Inception)
Another long comparison is the comparison of the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimova is proud not only of the same skin and blond hair as Annalyn McCord. And about Nathan Adrian of the US team, fans say he looks like the "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Powerful Women: Hope Solová football (left) and Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar face and eyes
Not only one: Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed similarities
On Waves Theory: According to this user there may be a reason behind similar relative to couples
One Twitter user recently on the website expressed her satisfaction that “the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solová and Jennifer Carpenter are in truth identical.”
Football star Hope Sol and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter have really incredibly similar face and eye shape.
Among other favorite comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to Laura Linney's actress's smile, or the gold medal holder for Gabby Douglas's gymnastics, proud of his wonderfully wide smile, which is like copying Gabrielle Union's smile, the star of the film Bravo, girls!
Commentator of the Olympic Games station CBC apologizes for saying of the Chinese swimmer that it "exploded"
The viewers of the central live transmission from the Olympic Games at the CBC station spurred the analysis of performance of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan commentator Byron MacDonald. The swimmer ended at the fourth place of the women's race on 4x200 m St.
The Canadian station CBC was forced to apologize for what one of its commentators said was that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “went out like a stench” and “exploded” during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald believed his microphone had been disabled when, at the end of the final of the championship women on 4x200 metres freestyle, he began to immerse his own opinions.
McDonald, who was supposed to bring the CBC commentators a “resurrection, ” said among others: “The 14-year-old in China gave up, you fool. ”
Too much excitement, she was pulling like a smell, she blew up.
Thanks.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhanová (14) swam the second race in time 1:57.79 - by 1.61 seconds slower than the Canadian Taylor Rucková and allowed the Chinese Canadians to reach.
The audience in Canada began to quickly speak online and were terrified by the tone and language that the commentator used
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: “Did the announcer report to the CBC that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "exploded"?
The idiot didn't notice he was still on the air."
Ai Yanhan from China in the finals of the women's race at 4x200 metres freestyle was described as "the little 14-year-old Chinese gave up, you fool."
Critics Byron MacDonald on Twitter came from all sides and many asked for his appeal
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald was, they didn't stick back.
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Soon afterward, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC, apologized for the live commentary McDonald, and said: “We apologize for the comment on the performance of the swimmer who escaped for the broadcast.”
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
CBC Station eventually apologized to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to a comment
Co-communicator Scott Russell must have apologized on behalf of MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and apologized to more than 90 Twitter users who complained on the comments of commentator MacDonald
The station also quickly apologized and published a statement.
She sincerely regrets that the words were spoken, she should not have gotten into the ether.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the radio and to those who watched us on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments concerned the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer itself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron deeply apologizes for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized on live television and tried to explain his remark by claiming that he did not want her to sound like a personal attack.
"I would now like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's staff," said in an Olympiad broadcast at CBC Station.
"I meant the performance of the swimmer and not the person of the swimmer as such."
"There's no need to say that I didn't intend to be disrespected, and I'm very sorry."
Customers at the Primark have been hurt by a woman who was embarrassed to try underwear in the middle of the store.
When a woman got undressed to try panties on a sales platform in the middle of Primark, they were not sure what direction to look for.
To make it worse, she tried to get her size down, took her panties off and put them back in the shelf.
She continued to look at it, and finally she tried four pairs of panties at the shop at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Flokestone.
Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkeston, where a woman tried her panties before returning them to the shelf
Jenny Davidson’s mother, who was at a time at the store, said that a mysterious woman “dressed herself again and left the store without buying anything. ”
She said, "People couldn't believe their own eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took off her panties, took off her own pantyhose and panties, and put them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place -- she just stood there, shuddering like a monkey."
"Everyone just stared at her panties again, and apparently she didn't like them because she brought them back to the shelf."
She did the same with three others before finally decided she didn't like anything, dressed again and left.
"She seemed to mind at all who was watching - not that she thought of the man who might buy the panties she was trying."
Miss Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: “This idea of someone taking home the panties that someone else was wearing and nobody cleaned them up, that’s disgusting. ”
The event took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “When she left, I picked up things that I clearly tried to keep them off the sale - which is also the only right thing. ”
"I would be amazed at the idea that I would bring home new panties and find out that another woman was wearing them, taking them off, and that they weren't washed."
The Premark spokeswoman said: “The Primark knows about the incident that took place at our store in Folkeston on Tuesday, August 9. ”
All the products concerned were withdrawn from the sale.
How to defend yourself against the attack of a weapon using the Cow Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com, it could be a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, the state-of-the-art Federation of Cow Maga, based in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain the advantage over the abuser, whether it's coming to you from the front or from the back.
If they approach you from behind, says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and "have a free line of fire".
Then you will grasp the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder just before you strike it into your face with a free elbow.
Then there's a knee to the weak, and while the attacker is glowing in pain, you twist his gun out of his hand, you hit his head in the face, and you start to retreat, and you keep the gun pointed at him.
If an armed man approaches you from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the firing line, grab a gun and kick it out so the bad guy can't shoot.
At the same time, put your strength in the weapon and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the weapon out of its fold and start retreating, still aim at it.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video where you'll see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way to get out of the ambush - if you're not the Grandmaster of the Cow Maga - is to issue all the cash.
Traveller Ian Wright licks the most dirty places in Europe for a tour guide
The British traveler decided to undergo a difficult test of his immune system and a lax reflex - by licking the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
Ian Wright (51), originating in Suffolk, used the euro banknote to prove the strength of his immune system, the Piccadilly Circus railing, the flushing button on the train and the Russian public telephone.
Before dressing each item, he used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he was letting go of.
The experiment on which the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed, however, brought interesting results.
The idea of licking the flusher button on the train, which has been used by thousands of other people, may seem completely repulsive, but the need in the kitchen sink is actually much more harmful bacteria.
During his journey across Europe, Ian Wright spoke to doctors and health specialists about strengthening the bacteria of intestinal flora and his own health.
Fortunately, none of what he licked left him anything worse than his taste in his mouth.
Ian Wright celebrated himself by testing the resilience of his intestines on his journey around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, completely safely his immune system tested - from public railings at train stations after flushing
In a film that he filmed about it, he says: “I have not been very concerned about my health since childhood, and I have done my best in my mouth, from clay to the eating of worms and mud water. ”
He confirmed his reputation in the film.
All he refused were dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple wipe, the luminometer showed the value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, fresh washed hands should have less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia, however, refused to lick after his luminometer showed more than 4,000 units, while the freshly washed hands had less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio filmed a traveller's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom
He said: "This is almost the worst thing I've ever felt in the bathroom."
Nothing more dirty than this!
I'm not gonna do anything because it's disgusting.
The film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of Valio dairy products.
Mr Wright received Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help people to strengthen intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior vice president of Valio for refreshments, juices, and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would be followed by capture and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We've invented a lot of crazy ideas that ended with the idea of "call Ian."
It is said that the interest in bowel health becomes a worldwide phenomenon.
Instead, to talk only about the products, we wanted to put them into broader contexts - good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of bowel health and how it is linked to the immune system.
Growing interest in healthy intestines is a worldwide phenomenon, and through this document we have brought more detailed information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: “Let’s say this, Ian would lose my respect if he licked some of what I wanted from him - like the disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film.”
To lick some things was naturally easier for Ian, others very hard again.
I'm glad we made some of the dirty stuff licked."
Valio carried out a survey in 2015, according to which 84 per cent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria primarily with stomach and intestine health and 58 per cent of respondents indicated that they at least occasionally used products containing added lactic acid.
A family socially needed prior to removal destroyed a municipal building in Saltash, Cornwall
The family of the socially needy left a fine of £50,000 on their general home after the charges of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner, Shaun Trebilcock, were evicted from home in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their violent removal from the house, the officials of the housing cooperative were shocked to find that the property was in an emergency situation.
In the walls there were holes, floor cover was torn, waste was rolled everywhere on the floor and the walls were mutilated.
The family has moved in and is considered to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, head of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was concerned that she was going to save the house.
She said: “It was a nightmare for people here, and I don’t think that people should live like this.
There are a number of circumstances to consider, since this property is probably coming into the consciousness of Cornwall's "not that nice a part."
The family is notorious and their names are notorious.
The couple had three sons who lived in the house at times, and the police said that the horror that the family was dealing with belonged to street battles using baseball bats, intimidation of the surrounding inhabitants, drug use, drug distribution, and loud screaming, quarrels, and abuse.
Skeldon (47), whose name was mentioned on the lease contract, was awarded punishment for antisocial conduct in June.
In several rooms in the house, which may be demolished, odourful waste was found.
In the house where drugs have been distributed in the past, the floor cover has been torn out
Neighbors say they saw them on the street fighting, and regularly people called the police here.
Cornwall housing her and her partner forced her out of the house this week after they got an additional period of 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The neighbors who were relieved welcomed the move with their lives being a living hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We've lived next to them for 20 years, and it's always been this way.
The number of times we've seen the police here, we can't count at all.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because there was an incredible silence here - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, supervisory manager in the vicinity of Cornwall Housing, stated that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
Family lived in the house for 20 years, the police were regularly summoned to the house
Wastes and old toys rolled into the enlarged part of the municipal house
He adds: “It is a shame that the tenant could not accept responsibility for her own behavior and for the conduct of her family.
There was a very complicated case because their behavior was extreme and their actions according to the witness had to be appalled by her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team has done, the police from Devon and Cornwall, and the members of the local community who have been bravely informing us.
I hope this step will bring some comfort to the neighbors, and at the same time, it will carry the message that we will not tolerate unplanned behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons of the tenant who lived in the house at various times were about 20 years old.
Pollution from mattresses left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after removal
Workers will now have to remove piles of waste that have been thrown around the house
In 2014, she conducted house shelfwork and found over 70 grams of cannabis, weights, equipment and 1 700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon got a ticket when she was found guilty of possession of class B drug she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was based on a house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tanya and her moving partner now live in private accommodation in Plymouth.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who violate the rules of their rental contracts.
Angela Crow, of Denov and Cornwall police, stated that evicting was a clear message to other tenants who would continue to violate the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can act without punishment, and to those who would want to follow it," she said.
The police of Denov and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and inhuman behavior and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal scared after a low flight of military jet over the beach
Tourists who tasted the sun rays in Portuguese Aveira were scared to death
Airplane of Portuguese military air force P-3C Orion flew through incredibly low
Military Air Force declared that it was an exercise flight, and it insisted that there was no security threat.
At a time when the low-flying jet landed over a crowded beach, frightened tourists panicked.
Dramatic images show how a military aircraft reaches almost a touch from the sun’s people on a sandy beach near Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to pick up after the sound of jet engines upset them, without seeing what was coming out of the clouds.
There was an incident yesterday afternoon at Costa Nova near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several recruits who published video recordings of a dramatic social network pass, said: “The plane flew twice as low and at one point it seemed to collapse.”
Nuno Arroja adds: “I surfed, and I really thought the plane would fall on my head. ”
Tourists on the beach in Aveira were terrified when a low-flying plane appeared out of darkness
The Portuguese military air force today declared that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft had been on a training flight to identify a fishing vessel off the coast and had to endure low because it was the only way to check the ship.
The aircraft allegedly flew a little lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the flight insists that the safety of people was not compromised.
The forest fires this summer destroyed part of mainland Portugal and claimed four lives on Madeira.
The Portuguese military air force today stated that the pilot had to fly low due to dense fog and smoke from fires that prevented him from seeing
The flight was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify a fishing vessel in the course of his training.
Half the funeral services do not comply with regulations.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with legislation.
The Czech Trade Inspection (ČOI) found that during the second quarter checks.
According to her, the funeral services do not usually inform the remaining persons of their prices or do not issue written confirmations of the acceptance of the order.
The Czech Republic imposed 41 fines in the total amount of CZK 73,000.
Today, her spokesman, Jiří Fröhlich, informed her.
The Inspectors found out that 47 out of 95 were in doubt.
In addition to non-information on prices and missing confirmations, certain funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed upon.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and one seller used an officially uncertified criterion.
Therefore, the inspection prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of CZK 7077.
This involved packings for urns, candle caps and vases that were not properly marked with mandatory information.
"As there is still a breach of the law in this specific service area, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
London's schoolgirl who joined IS was killed in Syria
It was announced that Kadiza Sultan, one of the three British schoolchildren who left London last year to join the IS, died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that the family had learned about her death in Syrian Cancer several weeks ago.
ITV News announced on Thursday that it was likely killed during a Russian air raid in Rakka, which is a bašta group in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just as she was preparing to flee the war - torn land and return to Britain.
"One wants to believe that the only good in this whole thing - as a message and a warning to others that these are real dangers associated with the way to the war zone - is to discourage people from making decisions at any time," Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolchildren from the eastern part of London joined the plane in February 2015 to Turkey and then to the bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultana family learned that she had married an IS fighter in Syria and had widowed herself in a few months.
Reid says if Clinton's elected, he'll leave Garland as the Supreme Court candidate.
The Senate leader for the democratic side of Harry Reid says he is convinced that Hillary Clinton's presidential election candidate nominated Judge Merrick Garland to the highest court in the event of his election.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, even though President Barack Obama nominated him already in March.
The leader of the Senate majority, Mitch McConnel, says that the person who replaces the late Supreme Court judge will be elected by the future president.
Reid said during the conference call Thursday that he believed Clinton would choose Garland "with a certain degree of credibility."
Reid's speaker later said that he wasn't directly talking to Clinton about whether Garland would be nominated and that he was merely speculating.
He appreciated Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want someone else's choice "to blow the ship".
Garland is the chairman of the federal appeal court in Washington.
Reid said that the republics blocking Garland's appointment are the "listers" and the "jumpy" Republican candidate for the presidential office Donald Trump.
He said Trump's not fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, naked calendars for “women and men”
Magazine Treats works closely with photographer David Bellemer on the 2017 calendar, inspired by the 70s' Pirelli calendar.
But instead of discovered known personalities, they try to find another generation of top models for their calendar 2017 NU Muses.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine full of nakedness is different from Playboy from old school because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar's the same.
"We have to go back to showing overtime and classic nakedness, when both women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by photos of the woman's body," Shaw said in a press release for the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a wonderful piece of art.
Models can send their images online or personally during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does vinyl go: who actually buys record recorders?
Vinyl is a middle-aged man who loves to be alone.
Before you choose the section of comments to wrap up with pepper notes under the pseudonym NoAllLonelyMakingIn the Middle Ages, we note that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov so much debated the resurrection of the record record is connected not to the boom of the millennials who want to love the originality of the possession of a physical object, but to the nostalgia of the middle age.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album are most likely people between 45 and 54 years of age.
Young people between the ages of 18 and 24 are at least likely.
It's not really the accumulation of excited fans - the whole thing has an emotional dimension: older people who buy phonograph boards are more likely to want to keep their feelings (56% versus 53%) and they like themselves (69% versus 66%).
But are youG's results true?
If this blog was broadcast as a television report, a camera would follow me as I travel to the busy street in Soho, dressed in a thin grey suit and gesticalized. Then I would stop, pull out my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's look at it."
Let's take a look at this.
While Soho's heart is slowly draining his charm and magic - buildings once occupied by independent vendors are now filled with hotels, restaurants and dining rooms, confections and office needs - a few fantastic specialized shops with turntable boards remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while, and I'll stand close to different men in these stores and try to see what their age and emotional disposition are.
Stuart (55), a native of Glasgow, who I've been following from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight middle-aged men, one woman about 20) has an afternoon meeting in London and is looking into business to fill out a few hours of time.
I'm asking him if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I've got about three or four thousand recordings.
All these recordings paint the walls of his living room - on the picture above (the picture was sent to me by e-mail, I didn't follow him home).
This huge amount of albums and singles is also due to the fact that he can afford it: he can now buy phonograph boards that he couldn't afford when they came out originally, and he's buying again what he sold in his youth and didn't even have a Windsor.
"Good of what I buy is from the late '60s and early '70s. These are things that would have been issued to me when I was 11 or 12. I was too young and couldn't afford them," he says.
They agree that those who buy tapes are probably introverts who like the company of themselves, and they add: “I don’t smoke or drink too much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works in Sister Ray, and he also thinks that the number of customers he meets fits the profile of YouGov.
He also noticed a new influx of people affected by the media wave. People who heard about the comeback and felt forced to buy their old record record back.
According to my interviews, people had their collections dropped most frequently between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their record record and bought their CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their record record back," he says.
That could explain the boom lovers of record recorders of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of phonograph boards?
It won't take you more than a few seconds to find a pleasant community of people with similar feelings in a store like Phoenix.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly impaired by the system of non-contact payments.
In the digital world, some gramophone board supporters may feel overwhelmed and have decided to take advantage of the familiar environment of the phonograph boards packagings, the things that bring memories of peaceful adulthood.
"I think filling gaps or acquiring something material can bring some comfort," Wez says.
I'm a collector myself, and it's like that with me, and I think a lot of people, too.
It's an easy way to fill a place in your head.
"We are all their social workers!" said the co-worker from the phonograph boards.
In April, an ICM survey revealed that almost 50 % of the people who had previously bought a vinyl album had not yet listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of the phonographs they never use, while 7% of those who buy phonographs do not have a phonograph.
At this point in the story, he must have seemed really worried going through the crowd with a new boss.
The aspect of “trophy” and revitalizing interest is something Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
"Somebody recently came and said, "I don't have a record player yet, but I want to buy it on the radiohead board so we can put it on the shelf," he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it's happening.
It's more of a product page than music.
People come to us saying, "I don't have a record player."
They're the younger people, not the older ones, the grown-up teenagers who get into it.
Fopp, where currently almost one floor is reserved for the record board, has a much more diverse visitor on my arrival.
There's a couple of '70s, tourists taking pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as the shops before - instead of the speakers the latest pop from Wild Beasts full of synthesizers and sex, it is good to see different customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but the absorbing mental trauma is hard to predict when you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) takes several minutes in Fopp to go through and look at various record record record in discount.
He's one of the ones who's more of a window watcher than a hard spender.
In his own words, he doesn't make much money, so it doesn't count as collecting record records.
It costs a lot of money.
It is easy to listen to music on a computer or something, but record recorders have their magic...," she sighs eagerly.
I can't explain it. It's unique.
My last stop is a business that supposedly inspired a new generation of record record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I'm pretending to be very involved in girls' tugs in tight jeans, and I'm watching a group of teenage girls who are just gathering around the Polaroid cameras, and then their father and daughter are deciding to buy Crosley's turntable.
On the left is a staircase whose wall is covered by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of record record record.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are only for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they cannot be reached.
It's a pure "vinyl trick".
But since any attraction to it could mean more money for the industry and send several customers to the Soho depths for others, there's not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area, where there is probably more time and money than in other areas, is also the one where the most expensive goods are spent, which is definitely what it is.
But while my findings suggest that youGov's results are accurate - at least in record record stores, they do not take into account the large number of wine collectors and lovers who actually exist, in record record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
He certainly doesn't spend a Thursday morning wandering around a record store on Berwick Street, walking records and avoiding the strange, 30-year-old fake TV moderator who hides behind the back of no-suspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
According to scientists, Greenland's shark has the longest medium life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says that the recording shows a female whose age is estimated to be between 272 and 512 years and measuring 5 meters.
The court in France refused to tear up business at Jangule refugee camp
The French court dismissed the Calais authorities’ order to demolise dozens of visiting shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the hearing this week, the Calais authorities suggested that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 commission shops, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hair cutting, sell tea for 50 cents in the sightseeing restaurants, or sell basic meals for a few euros.
The prefect's office in Calais argued that places must be dismantled because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they pose a risk of a fire and a health risk.
Humanitarian organisations in court stated that shops and restaurants are vital and that the free food offered by the state-supported association and other groups does not provide food supplement for growing numbers of refugees in the camp.
A number of sightseeing shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
The court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for preventing people from operating 72 commission shops, but stated that the objections of Prefect Calais were “explainable”.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants play a much greater role than simply serving food to people who “live in extremely desperate conditions.”
He said the premises provide quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites threatened by democracy was the camp’s café, Jungle Book Kids, which is operated by a non-profit organization, offering daily 200 meals, English and French and asylum counseling for hundreds of vulnerable minors without escorts in the camp.
The child’s coffee shop petition signed more than 170 000 people.
Guardian received a letter stating that closing the coffee shop “was a disaster for these children, some of which are only 8 years old.”
The Charitative Organisation Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrans on Friday estimated that the number of refugees in the camp after the steep increase in arrivals during the summer rose to more than 9,000 - which is the most so far in the world.
He thought he was dead.
The Volleybal Ústí crosses themselves.
"I have been able to train normally since March," he reported on the start of the summer preparation in full force.
What's the matter with you?
I had bilateral pulmonary embolism, then heart problems.
Because when I was at the University of Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble caused a long flight to Asia?
I had a lump of clot for two years, and I didn't know about it.
It hurt me, nobody found me anything.
Then the clot got up.
There's a broken vein in the calf, it's gonna hurt all the time, especially when the weather's on or off.
But nothing that limits me, rather an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about life?
He did.
I didn't know I had embolism last year at the summer tournament in Woodenville, and I couldn't move anymore.
I threw up blood tonight.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, I was five days away completely.
I really thought I was dead in Wooden, my girlfriend and family.
I've seen myself somewhere else.
How did you deal with it?
I guess I had to live through it, and now it's just going to go up.
I know there's some blood issues that I have to watch out for when I fly somewhere.
But you can do anything about it.
Only when I wanted to go back to Prebrami last year, there were still heart problems.
Everything's fine now.
Since March, I have prepared myself at home to be able to play again.
I'll knock it off. I'm physically better at it than before.
What do you expect from the Ústí?
I'm looking forward to it, the party looks good, I know most guys.
I'm curious about the other two strangers who are coming.
I hope we sit human to make it work together.
Can you lift up the Ústí?
He had the reputation of a decoy, but every season is different.
Brno was eight two years ago, now the second one's over.
There's a new team in Ústí, only a few players left.
It was the last in extralysis, so there's a lot of room for improvement.
The way we use it, it's up to us.
We'll see after the first lap, who's gonna be a jerk, we don't think.
Is it a guarantee of coach Brom's success?
He's experienced and experienced a lot, he'll think of a better place than the last.
But my coming didn't have anything to do with it, I made a deal earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, with one I'm a big friend, and it was agreed to work here.
I'm not gonna call it a name.
Finally, Mr Brom came and I'm glad.
My big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been practicing for decades, he's been a good player.
He'll move us up.
What will you bring?
This team is going to fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to play, and I like to get an opportunity on a top team.
I've been in Pribram for two years, but Ústí is more of a challenge than being on team six right now, because it starts at the bottom.
You mentioned a stranger, he's already training Australian Boehm in Ústí.
What's he look like?
I happen to know him, and at the university, we played against each other in a group.
And we used to hang out there a couple of times, and we used to hang out after the fights, so we already know each other in a friendly way.
We beat them 3-1, and I just got him on his way to summer prep in Ústí.
He has a slovak girlfriend, he's cute.
American Nadazdin and Brazilian Ze are still coming.
Do you know anything about them?
I wrote with an American, he looks like a good kid, a Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
You've contacted an American?
It felt like a good idea.
I'm a recorder, so whoever makes it, so I should communicate with everyone.
Right away, I found out what the players were, I found on the internet, like he's playing, I saw some videos.
He was pretty cool, kid jumps, he's tall.
On Facebook, we wrote a couple of messages, he seemed like a joke, he's gonna fit in.
How are you looking forward to the position of recorder number one?
I didn't mean to take anything else.
I'm just gonna be twenty-four, and I don't have the sense to go and change it.
I'd rather be in the center of action. I'd rather run the team than be led by someone else.
I probably don't want to play anymore if I'm supposed to be like the second recorder and do it for the full time.
How many times have you been number one?
Half-time in Pribra, when it wasn't as bad as the captain, he got hurt, then there was money problems, and he left.
Since then, we've been climbing up and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, which I've been staying with, I've been changing the number one and the number two.
It was a great year in the Old Town, after which I had many offers and just chose Pribram.
Budejovice wanted me from there, I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short position remains the Phelps domain.
"To be once again on the levels of winners and to hear an an anthem is as sweet as ever," chuckled Phelps and again had eyes full of tears.
His fiancée and mother once again cheered in the auditorium, the son of Boomer slept quietly with headphones on his ears.
I'm having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago, I started swimming racing, and in a few hours, he said he was touched.
In the finals behind Phelps, a silver Japanese named Kosuke Hagino lost two seconds of his life.
Bronz won the Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from last year's World Championship.
After Alu Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (dealer), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to control the same discipline in four games.
After most of the race, other American Ryan Lochte and home Thiago Perreira were led by Phelps.
While the gold defender in the final Kraular's 50s set himself up with a crushing finish, they fell off the medallion position.
The American superhero will have at least one chance to expand his unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the ceremonial declaration of the position, he went to the finale of the race for 100 metres of butterflies.
The legend could not even be covered by Ryan Murphy, who won a double line after a hundred years in Rio.
In the final he left 37 hundred Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin, Russian Jevgenius Rylov finished third.
While Murphy's last year's World Championship is only the fifth of two hundredths, in Rio he became a royal king.
From the imaginary throne he planted Larkin, the same double who made it to last year's world championship.
But at the Olympics, he's only won the medal now.
The Canadian Penny Oleksiaková and American Simone Manuel shared gold in the royal hundredth.
For 16-year-old Oleksiak, it was the fourth medal in these games, for Manuel's second in silver from the staff.
Swimmer gold won the OH as the first African-American woman in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for everyone who comes after me, the sport will become love for them and they'll get to where I'm going, said the touched Manuel.
The third was Sweden's Sarah Sjöström, who won a 100-meter race in Rio in the world record and still has silver from the kraula 200th century.
Until the sixth, the world recorder, Australian Cate Campbell.
Japan's Rie Kanet won two hundred breasts, for which it is the first Olympic medal in the 1970s.
It has no valuable metal or world championship, its fourth highest place in this discipline in 2013.
Russia's Julia Jefimov won the second silver in Rio, which, despite the history of doping, is facing the hatred of viewers and rivals.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won the trial, and I don't know why I should still answer these questions.
I'm so tired of it, she told the Russian swimmer.
The starting right in Rio has been obtained by the special panel sports arbitration CAS just before the start of the games.
They were dealing with my appeal, and I won.
If anyone likes it or doesn't like it, or if they have a different opinion, to refer to the arbitration court, she added it.
Hermann: Disappointment, we could have won.
And midnight start?
I don't remember.
The Czechs had a special day.
Only less than an hour before the game, they found out who they were going to fight against.
They must have been able to do tactical training.
And then, in a non-traditional time, they started a game on a small court number one.
The first set didn't start well, then the rivals took the lead, but at 19:19 they couldn't handle the end.
In the other they were clearly better and better, but the decisive tie-break did not come to them.
Above all, the series of services displayed meant a loss of 10:15 and a farewell to the Olympic tournament.
"We could have defeated Russia," regretted Hermann.
How would you rate the game?
Hermann: After the unfortunate start, before I played out, we got into the game beautifully.
At the end of the day, in the last balloon, I got the income I used to get.
We lost a hundred, which was key.
In the next set we entered them with an overview of the playground, another defense and we pushed to the service.
There was a very corrupt application in the tee-bracket, and that's where we picked up this page.
It was a disappointment because we could defeat the Russians.
The damage to the beginning of the first set, that's where we got away.
We were able to download it, but we missed the points.
The second set was great and in the third decided service.
We made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points, and it was five points, and we hesitated a lot.
It's too bad because the Russians were playable.
How did you play in little castle number one?
Sluková: Similar to China in the backyards.
The environment and the atmosphere were different.
There was one hour at night, a complete silence, music didn't play, nowhere.
That was the difference across from the center.
We wouldn't choose such conditions, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the game when you found out the names of the opponent an hour before the game?
Hermann: She was strange.
We started practicing for the game without knowing the players, so we couldn't do tactical training for the other teams.
But Simon (Knower Nausch) has set up a tactic for almost all the options that were there.
He had a lot of tactical papers ready, so after this page, we were pretty well prepared.
Do you remember ever starting a midnight fight?
Hermann: I don't think so.
We played at 11:30, but at 12.
Russian Birlov's block in front of the playoff at OH in Rio.
Beach volleyball women Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermann hugging in front of the playoff at OH in Rio.
Was it unpleasant?
Sluková: By playing the last two matches in the band from ten, we had the mode moved earlier.
This was two more hours.
It's strange, I can't imagine that another sport has athletes who have to deliver their best performance at twelve o'clock.
But I think we've prepared as best we can.
We knew it would be so, but it's not exactly typical, and I guess it won't be my favorite playtime.
How do you value the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the procedure of the group was our goal, it is on the one hand fine, good.
We did what we said.
But now after the game, I'm sad.
Sluková: I will sleep out of it, and I will remember the Olympic tournament only positive from tomorrow.
Big brother's here, here comes the first snoring SIM.
You won't escape her.
The new rules shall apply to all persons without Thai passport who, while staying in Thailand, decide to establish a SIM of one of the local operators.
Not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas who, for example, work in Thailand or have married there.
The Secretary-General of the National Broadcasting Authority and the Telecommunications Commission, Sokorn Tantasith, informed that there would be no exceptions.
The sales plan for SIM exclusively intended for foreigners was presented by the national telecommunications regulator at the beginning of August.
The new measures, which will enable monitoring of their position, intend to be implemented by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a means of maintaining national security that will allow foreigners to deal with the crime they have committed.
In addition, so-called SIMs help to detect persons who exceed the permitted stay.
In the case of sellers, they should also discover a special SIM for foreigners by the SIM designated exclusively for Thais within a six-month period.
The difference will be the monitoring function, which will be permanently turned on for cards assigned to persons without Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This function at SIM for Thailand is not because you can always be easy to track," Tantasith added.
It is necessary to add that in Thailand prepayments are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires an identification document.
On the other hand, for several years one of the operators gave free starting SIM to tourists at airports.
They were so anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand considers ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries including, for example, Malaysia or Singapore.
They also currently cover compulsory SIM registration, but legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the appropriate measure does not mean an obligation for foreign nationals to take up a local operator when entering the country of SIM.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
The operators of a given country know only relevant network information after crossing the border, i.e. when the SIM is logged into their network.
So they know the phone number, but not the owner information.
However, the difference in roaming prices compared to the rates of local operators is far from that of most tourists during their stay in Thailand to start looking after local SIMs.
The efforts of the authorities to control the movement of foreigners by foreigners living in Thailand have been legitimately faced with immediate criticism.
The Tantasith situation calms and, in the context of privacy protection, the planned system equates to the obligation to provide residence addresses in immigration documents.
In addition, police will need a court order if a specific person is to be monitored.
Any abuse of the system will be threatened by an undetermined punishment.
"If a service provider follows the position of SIM without a court order, he will be charged with a criminal offence," Tantasith added.
In addition, the system should maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While there is currently a recycling of a specific number until the 90-day period after which the SIM did not apply to the network, a renewal of the number could take place after 15 days in the event of Thailand's departure.
Luxury apartment in the new building on Vinohrady has a swimming pool and a hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in the new building?
We've been looking for a carefree apartment where most care about real estate will be provided by the manager.
The condition was sufficient parking places and elevators in the house, which essentially disqualified the older construction.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with rocking the floor, high energy demand and the like.
The conditions were also large terraces, which the old building was unable to offer.
More interesting visits can be found in the journal Modern Apartment.
The whole interior for you was designed by architect Lenka Langer and his colleague Kamila Polák from Artig Studio.
Why did you address them?
Would you recommend working with everyone's expert?
We would recommend working with the architect to everyone, if he proposes an apartment from the beginning, it is a very complex technical process.
The second plane is the design of the interior itself: designers have a significantly better idea of a range of possible materials and, on the basis of the client's wishes, are able to reconcile the interior appropriately.
We worked with architect Lenko Langer on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, there was a clear choice for us, even during the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wished for a generous social-residential space with an adequate background for a four-member family as a modern but not a cold interior.
The priority was to reach the connection of the apartment with the terraces and realize intelligent household management.
And, of course, it was necessary to ensure the quality of the work.
Did you leave everything on the experts, or did you intervene in the final form of the interior yourself?
All proposals including technical drawings and samples of materials have been approved, but the proposal has always come from architects.
At the beginning, we set out what we expect of design, and we showed some of the elements of the interior that we would like to incorporate into the proposal, such as carpets or paintings.
I think it was our collection of mainly Czech authors including the works of Karl Malich, Karl Vysusil, Václav Špály or Otto Gutfreund that helped guide our taste.
Also a combination of black, white and nut wood was an idea of architecture as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art etc.
Did some complications arise that caused you to give up your original ideas, or do you want to make new ones?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project when we came to the construction when it was possible to climb to the height of our floor for the first time, and found that the views we had planned were actually shadowing the surrounding building.
That's when we changed the position literally overnight from base to base.
A granite was used on the kitchen line and on the roofing of the fireplace wall.
In the interior, the wood surfaces of the attached skin dominate, for example, the cutting of the Norma’s dining and bar chairs from the harper.
How would you characterize interiors?
Are you going to make any changes or is there something you'd like to have a different one today?
I think it's a modern air interior, which, above all, fulfills its purpose.
We're not going to make any changes, most of the post-inhabitation adjustments took place in the shade and dwelling of the terrace.
Perhaps the only clue is to the floor when the nuts wood appear to be too sensitive to the house with the dog.
The word architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornýová, authors of realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, which is why it was possible to complete new disposal solutions and several other modifications within the building.
For interiors is an important element of the placement of light sources in the ceiling of the corridor and the main toilet.
That's how we got daylight into the darker room of the apartment.
Also direct entrance from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the construction adjustments that was very useful for the entire apartment function.
The pool and the hot tub are also part of it.
Compared to the French, you are not negative, says a Muslim woman living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, a short distance from the Spanish border.
I've moved in quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalism, which led me to work in a magazine.
So why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was beginning to feel like I was choking in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere between people.
It seems to me that every Frenchman is so negative.
People in France are being negatively controlled in general, but things have gotten worse recently.
It's interesting that you're mentioning negativity.
This is how some people value the Czech character.
Trust me, you're not negative compared to the French.
It may not happen to some people when they come to France because they don't see it that much as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
A big topic needs money.
People feel that they have little money, but the minimum wage in France is 15 hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now, there's also a problem with the behavior of people against Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street I lived in, my non-Muslim neighbor began to look at me through his fingers just because I was a Muslim.
It's like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I wasn't feeling well in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job elsewhere, and I ran into a vacant place at Air France here in Prague.
I confess that I didn't know from the beginning of Prague at all.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, Father even told me about what was going on in Czechoslovakia, but I had no idea what to expect from Prague.
I've been here for three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't catch any negative reactions or offensives, but I feel like people are more freer here.
That I can do anything, put on anything, and no one will judge me.
There's always someone in France looking at you uncomfortablely, like when you're wearing special clothes and stuff.
In Prague, I started to feel really free.
Pigs don't think they care about that kind of thing.
Where do you work now?
After working in Air France, I worked for one travel website for a while.
Then another friend and I started a website on which people offer and look for shared housing.
We are only active in Prague so far, but we would like to extend it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are Czechs from the middle, and two other Czech friends.
I have to say that another Czech specification is that at first it keeps its distance.
He's not gonna let anyone near the body right now.
That's pretty different from where I grew up.
Everybody hugs and kisses on their faces in the south.
It's different here, but I understand it's cultural, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned you don't speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, it is quite simple in Prague, because perhaps everyone here speaks English.
Even at parties or in food.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And by having at least a little communication in English, I don't need to learn a language so quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you met any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're a Muslim?
Not really.
It may also be that I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience I've been thinking about.
My boss, the Czech Republic, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense: It's not French, it's Africans.
That touched me quite a bit.
But that someone would have a problem with me being a Muslim, it hasn't happened to me yet.
Even though my colleague once pointed me out some anti-Muslim demonstration.
He told me not to go downtown, that they'd be teasing me.
In part, the anti-Muslim demonstrations are related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something like that could happen in Paris, Nice or Brussels could happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, anything can happen nowadays.
I haven't been able to imagine something like this happening in France until recently.
And it's not just about Muslims.
In addition, Islam does not recognize violence at all.
For me, people who kill are not Muslims.
The Koran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel about terrorists being protected by your faith?
It's very difficult.
I feel cold and guilty, even if I shouldn't feel that way.
I try not to follow the violence reports too much, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that's not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for terrorists?
We met at Jiří Square from Poděbrad.
On Wednesday, the Czech Muslims, along with Christians, demonstrated their opposition to violence.
Did you register this?
I didn't know about that.
But I understand that people feel the need to prove that they don't agree with violence.
I don't think they'd have to do that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't do?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
For example, my colleagues are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little more religious than I am, so we sometimes have a pretty wild discussion about Islam because we all perceive it a little differently.
I'm from France, so I went through a different education, and they, like, taught Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
The people of Islam sometimes associate themselves with the subordinate position of the woman.
How do you feel?
I don't seem subordinate in any way.
More like the opposite.
I'm a woman, I'm strong.
It's also because you don't wear a head covering.
Like a hijab?
And it's signed on the most important way I've been raised.
For example, my mother is a truly fundamental Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but he just doesn't wear a scarf.
She always taught me that faith is a personal thing.
Depends on how he interprets it.
When a man reads the Quran, he should have his own opinion on these things.
So when I read in the Quran a passage saying that God had told the Prophet to hide his wives from the sight of others, I said to myself, "I am not the Prophet's wife, why should I hide myself?"
On the other hand, I respect that, and when I come to Iran or Saudi Arabia where the scarfs require it, I will take it.
Are you planning on staying in Prague?
So far, yes.
I didn't feel so good anywhere else.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but I'm great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Prague is an ideal city for that, I think.
The Czech Muslims, along with Christians, demonstrated their opposition to violence.
Sailor of the Kozel Fencl Wind in Rio hit the processional slopes.
Friday's sea rides in the Brazilian Rio de Janíro were the Czech yachtmen Veronica Kozelské Fenclové.
In the Laser Radial class moved before the final two racers to the tenth place.
That would ensure Czech participation in the final ride.
You pick up packages like pokémonos.
They want to compete with carriers.
The idea is to take advantage of the already scheduled journeys for shipments is followed by TV director Matěj Liška and manager of the Prague music club Marek Gregor.
With the thought of inhaling the life of a triple application with a different geographical reach.
We launched the National Transfer app in May.
At this point, there are thousands of cities in it and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn this first, before we focus more on foreign countries, says in an interview for iDNES.cz, a twenty-four-year-old manager.
How does the Transfer application work, and who can benefit from it?
You pull it off and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and data on how big the package you can transport and how much you want for it.
Somebody's asking for a transfer on that day again.
When the route and delivery time are met, it mates, and both will come with mutual notifications.
At that moment, the chat room will open where the couple will arrange for a broadcast.
How many people do you think would have to register to always find their courier?
I don't know the ideal state, I can't estimate how many registered and how many roads it takes to cover it completely optimal and each offer has to compete with demand.
It's already working on the main pelvis and it's logically easier than on the road between villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
So far, people are building trust and finding out that no one will run away with the package.
You didn't have to deal with a case like that yet?
How many users does the service have two months after the launch?
At the moment, we have about five to six thousand people making the way.
We consider that a success, and we believe that others will be packed up.
Isn't there a risk that the consignor will be waiting too long?
We hope that we will compete for large conglomerates just because we are able to deliver the same day and for a fraction of the price.
For a big company, you'll pay several grand in two hours for delivery.
You'll pay, like, a hundred or less here, because that's the way someone's already doing.
Should traditional transporters fear possible loss of customers in the future?
We hope so.
The market has huge potential, feeding here is a huge number of multinational carriers, as well as trade chains, where all began to shop and gradually found that quality is not responsible for what it pays for.
No one wants to find a ticket in the mailbox with a message that he has to pick up a shipment at the branch, first that day after 7:00.
At the time, I needed a package for six hours and waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and more functional service that won't upset anyone and send a competitive signal to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
No one ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as manager of the music club, Matěj Liška as TV director.
In 2014, they started preparing the Shippancee LTD application, which uses the pre-planned journeys between world metropolises, especially the aircraft.
In 2015, they set up a project to process a company that created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming lasted three quarters years and the application was placed on the market in March 2016.
The transfer applications began to develop in December last year and released this year in May.
This is a local version of Shippancee modified for the Czech market.
The applications by Mesík and Mesík Profi have been developed since January this year and have been made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was to make all these applications from the beginning, which one day connects in one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to adjust the application and then focus more on the global market in cooperation with a strong investor.
The shared economy has been a topic recently and this is a service of type AirBnB or Uber.
Don't you have any fear of being involved in an area that no one can say much about so far, where is the limit of sharing and where is the grey economy?
It's the same, only different product.
It is clear to us that if it succeeds and we go up with it, we will be the next thorn in the eye through the grey economy.
But even though someone saves and earns, it's not the intention to bypass financial authorities and tax controls.
Each user, on one side or the other, will be encouraged to pay his income if he makes a profit.
What makes you think the service has such great potential?
The sender saves and the carrier earns, respectfully reduces travel costs.
That's the strong idea that connects interest on both sides.
At the time of the social networks that people divide, we'd like this one to come closer.
They can make nice stories, people are happy to help someone, and they're gonna talk about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
People in my opinion have been missing a personal approach for a long time, and we say about this app that it's people's service.
So how do you guarantee that the courier with the package doesn't run away?
Each user of the application, together with the registration, scans a civil card and lists a bank connection, a payment card or a credit card.
These are channels that give service and human credibility.
The couriers also collect stars on the basis of evaluators.
We'll also offer insurance, we're still working on the details.
An uninsured consignment in case of loss or damage shall be held by a courier, but shall not be held liable under criminal law for the content, if there is something illegal inside and does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find him in a locked package in his trunk, or ten kilos of hashish, he's liable to the detachors.
Is there any risk of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
Registered are, if necessary, the supervisory administrative authority, which as the only one that will be able to observe it, neither we ourselves are able to see them, the data are protected against abuse.
How much money does a courier get after a successful delivery?
The courier sets the price and gets the full amount he wants to talk about.
In addition, several percent will be charged for facilitating contact.
This money is our profit, but it's only a few percent because we want to push the volume.
Nor can anyone charge that the shipment has not been delivered when the delivery has actually been delivered, the takeover and delivery are verified using the QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
In relation to the size or contents of the package?
You can move anything.
We have three sizes, small as a cube of butter, medium as a platoise of eggs and big as a bass beer.
Then there's no further restrictions, and if someone has a seat in the car, maybe they'll take over the fridge.
Plus the sender has the possibility to take a photo of the package in the application, so the courier sees what he wants.
You don't even have to pack a thing unless you want to hide the contents.
Put the courier in your hand and that's it.
Who came up with the idea, and how long did it take to start?
A friend got an idea over two years ago, and I didn't pay much attention back then.
Then he showed me a demo of an app with a transnational range, which aims mainly at a passenger plane.
At that point, I told him I wouldn't be looking for an investor, but I'd like to stand there and save myself.
The following year, we continued to develop before we founded the Shippansee LTD in London because of the greater credibility of the product.
But this isn't the version you're focusing on right now.
No, marketing focused on the Czech Republic, where we are trying to catch up with the application, because it was all part of the birth pain, and it's still something to solve and improve.
We are trying to react to customer feedback, and at the moment, we do not solve so much the foreign market.
We know it's a long run, but we don't brag, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippancee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were in a way upgrade.
The move was created when we said that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third app is local, for the city.
But he can send a package to the right address and to the other side of the world.
It works for the senders as well as the Transfer, but the difference is that in it as a courier you see shipments in the form of points on a map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolococator in your mobile.
Application for couriers who want to feed on this, we called it "Messnik Profi".
So someone can make a living by picking up packages in the city?
Exactly, the last app in Prague will be pulled by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make his way to work.
Now that they're all screwing with the pokémons, that's exactly the same thing they can collect.
A person sees where the contracts are in the city, comes to it, clicks and sees when it has to be delivered and transfers it.
It's set cheaper than competitive services.
At this point, we are still making a web interface that will be difficult for companies to send shipments, filling out information about them on the web, or creating points on the map.
We are then able to use their services, you need to inflate them every month.
You're fully committed to the project now?
It's excruciating, but we normally have it at work so that the project can be used and developed.
We're not a strong multinational investor behind us, we're two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea, and the other jumped in with other incentives and ideas.
Now we are looking for an investor strong enough to be able to handle with us not the Czech market, but who, with the passing of the ball, should go with us to the world product and become another huge player on the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The story of Titanfall 2 is about to bring about almost forgotten variety.
This will make the second part and the solo game in it will, according to the first information, be more varied than in Call of Duty.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling will be based on the concept of network charging in the first part.
It is therefore possible to look forward to the freedom of movement, which includes, in addition to running, the possibility of using a combat titan.
In addition to action passages, the game will contain levels focused on the reverse movement.
They'll remind the platform and include the rébuses.
To overcome them, therefore, there is a major pile of double jumps, running around the walls and rope slides.
In addition, enemies will need to be destroyed.
There will be no missing maps that resemble mazes and levels with special concepts.
For example, it will be possible to pick up and pull down platforms and close a powerful door.
That's how you manage the shape of a battlefield.
The pace of the game should thus radiate between furious events and calmer moments for exploring the unknown planet.
We're gonna play Jack Cooper on foot, dreaming about a pilot's career.
Cooper, at the beginning of the campaign, together with Captain Lastimos, will be defeated on the extraterrestrial planet Typhon, which is left by enemy soldiers.
And there will be no savagery there.
Lastimos, in the event of an accident, has suffered a fatal wound, and Cooper will therefore be tasked with operating the captain's Titan.
His dream of a pilot's career will come true before he knew it.
But the first step will be to steal the battery necessary to repair the robot.
Cooper's calls to the Titan will also be significant.
It serves players as a source of information about the soldier's past, but at the same time, robot isolated communication will create humorous moments.
For example, if the titan names all the injuries that Cooper faces in the planned jump.
The first information on the Titanfall 2 campaign came from the Polygon server.
In addition, the result will be possible to assess in two months' time and Bonusweb will bring you first impressions of the game network.
Titanfall 2 is released on 28 October, for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ mark will come to life, but the original publisher remains dead.
The Swedish company Nordic changes the name to THQ Nordic.
After the failure of the publishing company THQ in 2013, it gained a number of its brands and the right to use the logo and the name of the company.
Nordic produced, for example, the Darksiders 2 Death Edition or the Red Faction Collection package.
In addition, 23 games are created for the publishers, and 13 of them have not yet been discovered.
Thirty years ago, when I retired, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found 20 years of younger men, our neighbor.
I knew it from the start-- I obviously tried for a long time, then they got together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because she used to date someone like him in front of me.
She's completely out of her mind.
In those first days, even her voice changed. She had such a girl, a beloved voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
But I watched the whole thing.
He used to come out of work regularly at mid-fourths, so she always went out at 3:00 a.m. to buy.
Every day she tried to at least see him.
Later I found out they were meeting at his house in the laundry room.
How many times have I known they were there?
I got my keys, he was determined to land them there.
But I don't know why, I've always stayed home.
I've never been able to go there, take that decisive step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe that my wife was mentally controlling me.
Soon, I think she found out that I'm manageable to do what she wants.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just a bug.
At the same time, the neighbors suggested that they knew about it.
I was such a jerk that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all broke, it would be bad.
The only thing that's gonna happen to everyone in the family was a daughter.
So I've always postponed it, moved on and on.
But one day, I went to his apartment and I needed help with something in the laundry room.
He went there with me, and I told him I got anonymous, that he was dating my wife and that he was all in evidence of it.
I asked him what he was gonna say to me.
He stood there, shook his shoulders, looked in the ground, and didn't say a word.
Then I also met his wife once on the way from the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't respond to that, and she didn't say anything to me either.
Nobody told me anything back then.
I'm a man who's never been around much, who has a problem getting to know someone, let alone finding a woman.
So I wasn't even thinking about the divorce.
I kept relying on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her all of this and go on with her life.
It wasn't like that.
And I've never really dealt with everything.
I still have it in me.
I used to let her know that a lot, but I finally left it for peace.
He's still living in the next house, and I'm still living with her.
It's just more like my wife to my housekeeper.
At home she always did everything - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's busy.
I think she's always tried to keep me from complaining.
And it can be said that she's good as well.
But sometimes I want to stroke her, hug her, and she won't get away.
We go for walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks we have a happy marriage.
But she once told me she never loved me.
That she loved me and loved me, but that she didn't love me.
And I see that he loves him to this day, he's her god.
And I don't like that kind of life.
When it started, and I carried it very badly, I once told her I didn't want to live, and I asked her what she would say to me if it was over.
I wanted to know if she would agree to it or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: yes or no.
But she thought, and then she said, "But there's plenty of room."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim people.
Following the terrorist attacks, France is taking a step towards fighting radical Islamists and calling for help from the government and the local Muslim minority.
"If the Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee freedom of religion," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He intends to ensure that only the spiritual education in France is preached in the country.
He also wants to stop funding for mosques from abroad, where money is often used by jahaded preachers.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim people.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
She had already contributed to the review of financial flows between the mosques and the countries that financed their construction.
Soon, however, she was affected by internal conflicts, and she never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," said Vals.
The new foundation seems to be headed by the former Minister of Interior and Defence Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as the founder of the secular state.
About 2,500 mosques and molliteben are active in France, about 120 of them serve radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the French authorities have benefited from about 80 Islamic clergy from the country and have considered this step for several more decades.
German police also hit against jihadist clergy this week.
The Imams allegedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated a space where believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate broke out in France about a new institution that will replace the functional foundation.
All were speeded up by other terrorist attacks carried out by radical Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main tasks - ensuring the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also overseeing imams.
However, it is not yet clear where to obtain finances, although several proposals are being considered.
One of these is a special charge for the halal of food, which is mainly for meat resulting from slaughter according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by the sellers in order to provide a permit.
Part of the money would then travel to the Foundation's budget.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 people travel from France to Saudi Arabia on a traditional pilgrimage.
In addition, in French mosques, only preachers who went through educational programs at the universities there should be active.
This should make their preaching consistent with democracy.
The government also closes radical mosques.
"We have closed 20 of them since December and will follow," said Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.
"In France there is no place for those who declare hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was severely injured by an unknown shooter on Friday morning at a shopping center in north-Spanish Zaragoza, writes the Independent diary.
The shooting took place after the woman and daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in the car before the mall, where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun against himself, writes Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital by an uninjured daughter, an ambulance had to come to the men in critical condition.
The crime took place around 11.00 in the central part of the metropolis of the autonomous region of Aragon, near the local university.
Referring to the Spanish agency Europa Press writes Independent that the motive was probably the unresolved recent divorce of both partners.
Baptism wraps, waccas, ginger and chilli sauce.
In the summer, we wish for light, well-fooded dishes, but we the Czechs are rebels, and we have our own tastes and our own head.
And so from the summer gardens smells of grilled necks, a ponytail, pork knee.
Not too healthy, not too light, sometimes with the exception of salad or roasted vegetables.
True, grilling is safe for both time and dishes, and it is also a social matter and no one needs to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives, how to make well-dressed, which special tablemaking, their preparation represents a small ritual, but there is no need for long cooking, baking, frying or stifling.
And they will also contribute to our health.
Whether it is homemade sushi or sashimi, where the quality raw materials and a few well-adapted griffins are enough to make the preparation fun and the food itself a real exotic delicacy.
As well as easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
There is even a decline in time-consuming cooking and cooling of rice.
Paper can only be softened for a moment in water and then depends only on the fantasy of the cook, how to play with fillings and accessories.
There's no algae like algae.
The benefit of a number of food products in Asia today is that raw materials are generally already available.
Including a loaded sweet acid ginger, which is one of the basic flavors accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can prepare it at home, too, but the true pink garish ginger has a unique spicy spicy and yet gentle taste thanks to a secret recipe that mixes with several kinds of vinegar and ginger.
All you need to do is buy a bag of adequate size, and the annex with demonstrable antibacterial effects, encouraging digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are used in particular in Buddhist and Hindu cultures to serve and decorate food within various festivities and rituals.
Long ribbed banana leaves are very widespread in a number of countries in Asia and South America as a "help" for preparation of various roasted, cooked and fried dishes which are packed in them as well as in the alobal.
The banana leaf will then also convey a specific flavor.
We can buy in shops with exotic fruit and vegetables, even pre-cut into the shape of wheels.
But choose only green leaves, and therefore healthy, unspoiled and unblemished.
Similarly, the preparation of wacam, sesame, and sesame oil salad is easy.
It can be bought frozen again.
Anyone who often eats or prepares sushi will probably know the algae in particular.
In Japan it is one of the most important species of seaweed, from which it is produced by cutting, pressing and drying of the so-called nori leaves - i.e. fences intended for the production of sushi.
Wakame – a dark green algae growing in waters around the island of Hokkaidó – is also fresh and dried and is as popular as the algae nori.
By the way, who would not know the bowl of wacam soup, allegedly Asian women use it from sale to recovery after delivery.
And this algae has almost miraculous effects.
Pure blood, strengthens blood circulation, even allegedly forbids graying of hair and is literally loaded with mineral substances.
The dried and crushed vacuum also serves as spices, such as rice flavoring.
Fresh algae are first to be hatched in the water, then poured into the boiling water, and cooked for half a minute.
Then it cools down in ice water, cuts off the middle ribs and continues to adjust, like a favorite salad.
However, buying it already finished, frozen, is the easiest solution.
So it is just left to wash the roll with an easy vegetable filling, smooth and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a longevity bomb.
If you resist and don't throw in an extra grilled piece.
Eat well, easily and annually.
Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special raw materials and a little bit of skill, and you have an interesting fresh food that nicely combines the flavors.
And it's done once, two times.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g carrots, 40 g white radishes, 100 g green christ, 60 g salad cucumbers, 60 g wakame algae and 60 g sweet chilli sauces.
A handful of chopped coriander, a spoonful of black sesame, a spoon of sriracha chilli sauce, 20 g of mango and 40 g of loaded g of greature, a bit of pine nuts.
Let's get the rolls ready first.
We'll wet rice paper for five seconds in cold water.
Then we take him out and wait for him to soften.
In the meantime, in hot water, we will soon cook the christian outages, after about three minutes we will put them in a quick coolant in ice water, so that they do not lose their color.
We'll put a vegetable filling on the approved paper and wrap it up.
We prepare the fill from white radish, carrots and salad cucumbers, which we cut into fine noodles, mix them with sweet chili sauce, add a chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and paste them into rice paper.
We put christenings on the banana leaf, add twigs, and finish the whole meal with a wacam alkam, stuffed ginger, a manga slice, sprinkle the black sesame and add some pine nuts.
Britain must be satisfied with silver in seven rugby, Fiji chooses gold
The impressive performance of the UK in the seven rugby ended with a devastating trail at the last obstacle, Fiji defeated in the final game on Thursday night at the stadium of Deodoro here in Rio high 43:7.
The Fijians have taught master's lessons in processing, landfills, wearouts, support games, run to the line and brutal forces - and have gained gold, their first Olympic medal at all.
The defeat came with an unsurpassed price of comfort in the form of a silver medal - for Britain the third on a given day - and the British could be proud of their performance in the inaugural Olympic Cup, defeating New Zealand, Argentina, and South Africa.
The winning victory over the South Africans 7:5 in the semifinals the same day, may have died in the finals.
Of course, Fiji would have defeated a 15-member team in its form in full health.
It may not be a comfort to the British, but at least one of them may rejoice to have a neck around the gold medal tomorrow: Ben Ryan, former chief of England from Wimbledon, is the chief of the Fijians.
Great Britain has been insulting a bit of the way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost every game in Adelaide Sevens.
They're the only losers here.
This defeat, though it hurts, but progress is incontestable.
Fiji began to be a giant, reflecting the British breakthroughs for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and the other teammates, it was like running behind a number of buses in motion and champions of the world cup led 5-0 when Osei Kolinisau emerged from the corner.
Timer showed four minutes, and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which she was a convert.
12:0 and Britain will hardly touch the ball.
Great Mitchell tried to stop a giant Leon Nakaraw and stop him from score a third, but only Fiji slowed down.
In the seventh minute he threw Jas Veremalua touchdown into the right corner and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added another one after the return, and in the hours it was still more than one minute... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravivo then penetrated the tiny Brits and leaned on the line where he scored.
After the conversion to state 29:0 there was a break.
It was like Fiji was born for the 7s football, while the British were still learning how to transfer.
That's exactly how it is.
The British have half-time made massive changes, and the efforts of the Fijians have stopped... for the entire four minutes, which was good compared to the first half-time, until after the brilliant Fiji Josua Tuisov continued.
Dan Norton tried to gain an opportunity for the British, threw a touchdown to the left corner at an increase of 36:7. But long ago, the inhabitants of the Pacific Islands and their fans sang, waved, and danced.
It was difficult not to admire the completely joyful attitude of the Fijians.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame also sweetened another attempt at the victory of the Fijians.
The whistle rang, the Fijians hugged, and the British fell on the lawn completely subdued.
On the same day Fiji in the semifinals defeated Japan 20:5 and Britain conquered the South African Republic in a tight semifinal - by the difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans in the first half of the lead, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dazzling work of his foot, broke through the line of defense and scored in the second half under the hook.
Great late dump by Marcus Watson, brother Anthony of the 15th team of England, secured a victory - and eventually a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired the coach's battle with cancer to win the rowing competition.
On these games, you won't find more emotional gold - and that's what to say.
From the first shot to the last, during 220 criminal exhalations into history Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found additional significance in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Even though they were happy to sit two, there were three voices in the ship. When the ship swung across the sea to meet the second Olympic gold behind them in the race of female couples, there was still the voice of coach Robin Williams in the ship. They were the first women in the history of British sport to achieve such a result.
Their predominance was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained undefeated.
What we see - two excellent athletes flying around the water with elegance swans - does not reflect the nature of victory completely.
For each gold medal from the rowing is a battalion of helpful hands, which a piece by piece mean a difference. And no hands were more helpful than the hands of the coach, who 30 months ago did not know if he would survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it was uncertain.
I suffered the cancer of the bladder that can be operated, and I underwent this surgery.
Anything could happen without surgery.
It would be a very bad situation.
It's going to change your outlook on things a little bit.
The cancer was found to Williams in December 2013.
Fortunately for the whole trio it was that it could have started treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, and thus reduce the accident to a minimum - if that is the case, we can call it that.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together quickly.
That was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps was enough.
This is how it started.
Riding in itself is the way, but this was a bit more demanding.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, spoke less than usual as he tried to cope with his own unrest.
Stanning, captain of the regiment of the royal artillery, who is behind the mission in Aghanistan, said: “This week I was with emotions at the bottom, maybe it's a little extreme, but it means so much. ”
Again, it emphasizes how much it means to me how much Helen and I worked and Robin worked.
Up until now, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so he's got a huge thanks for it, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't wish for a better man for training, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning didn't lose one race in five years.
The twins put on a stunning rhythm that their rivals couldn't cope with.
Even in the final 500 metres, when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We were focused at the moment.
Helen shouted, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we didn't want to achieve anything fancy.
We weren't looking forward to today's fireworks, we just wanted to hang well, go out and win the race, which we succeeded in.
The twins will take a year to think about it before they decide what's next.
Glover's getting married next week, her coming is the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to find out I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel much better about it," she said.

Prison?
More like driving people for free, says taximafia hunter Rubesh to break the prosecution.
Six taxi drivers and a former magistrate in Prague are, according to the Czech Republic, accused.
You have made a number of reports that reveal fraudulent practices and those who are to be in a group that will be tried.
You've faced several unpleasant encounters with exposed actors because of this.
How much is the report on the charges of members of the organized group broken down for you?
I was expecting some court date to happen.
I'm especially curious about the verdict.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
It's no use.
First of all, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should return them by driving all people for free.
That's kind of a sizable solution.
Does this mean that you do not see any punishment as sufficiently effective?
It's enough for me that some of them are so afraid that they don't do the job anymore.
For example, one is a pingle maker, another is a pizza maker, and one is totally out of it.
The defendants can theoretically get two to eight years in prison.
Do you think that's an adequate rate?
I generally have a problem with the withdrawal of my freedom.
I consider it a bad punishment.
Putting someone in prison, especially in such a case, is nonsense.
Such people should return the societies they took from her.
For a quarter of a century, they did this because they destroyed our country and completely robbed people.
So let them make a good card now and get people out for free.
I can't imagine it differently.
It would work like a community service.
Like someone going to collect garbage, they'd get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they'll get a condition eventually, and they won't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Film Academy Miroslav Ondříček in Písek and then at the University of Tomáš Bati in Zlín.
These include people who started with virtual videos and videos directly for the web in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for Internet television Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of shows, he now prepares a series of Prague Guide, which is dedicated primarily to foreign viewers.
In the form of short reports, Rubes advises those who are better off serving in Prague and who are advised not to worry about using them.
Previously, he filmed a series of names How to do it, City of Fraud?, Life in luxury, A lot! and Prague vs. Money.
In the prosecution they are spoken of as an organized group.
The police have been tracking her for months.
Can such a network of underwater taxi drivers be described as Mafia?
They're such cute mobsters, not the way we know them from Kmotra.
It's more about the mobs, the juniors, but they're organized for sure.
It's just that they're guarding each other's tents.
Prague's all sorted out.
For example, I found that the main station does not like Paris, but Paris does not like taxi drivers waiting for Karlovy Lázně (dysco club)
Everyone's just guarding their place, and each group is somehow organized.
It's probably a network connection.
The defendants, however, are only seven people, six taxi drivers, and one former magistrate who warned the driver against controls.
As you say, the side effects of the streets have not disappeared.
So, what percentage of Prague frauds in the taxi service do you think it is?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst ones on the street are still there.
For example, I'm talking about Aleš Ryjáček.
It's a man who's really dangerous - he's driving a telescopic batter in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he's standing at Karl's bridge and driving people.
The last time I went with him, he asked me for seven hundred for three miles.
His police didn't hold him for any reason.
They just picked a few people from the whole big group.
However, the same situation is also true in other locations in Prague.
Thus, it is difficult to remove the already famous grasshopper, which seems to have much greater dimensions by seven people.
It's not for nothing, of course.
It will help, but all evil will not be washed away, that is true.
There are taxi drivers who steal from foreign tourists, still at the same places you showed in the reports, that's Karl Bridge or Paris Street?
Yes, that's right.
In these locations, they stand every day and break the decrees every day.
It ignores both the city police and the Prague magistrate.
She's not even a chick anymore, but she's totally indifferent.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Nevertheless, some of them, though only part of the group, will be brought to justice.
It's a breakthrough.
I must therefore ask: Do you feel satisfied?
If I'd taken it for granted, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is, and will always be to improve the center of Prague.
And even if I feel like it needs to be a little bit better, I will continue to do so.
You need to push the door on the other side.
Even if the last thief remains there, we should still do something to remove him.
You can't settle for that.
But that's not the case, of course there's more.
Are you still trying to confront them in the cabs?
Sometimes I do test rides, and I have to say, it's still bad.
I just caught a cab driver last week, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 crowns for three kilometres, although he then claimed that it was 56 crowns (used a ten - mile - long trick).
He had the receipt, the cops came in, and this cab driver was so cute, he was still looking at those cops, and he asked them when someone finally gave him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver overlayed the decimal line and robbed the tourists by 357 crowns.
Can it be said that even after you showed the faces of those who charged senseless sums for a short ride, the daringness of the fraudulent taxi drivers did not pass away?
Their insolence is still incredible.
How did 56 crowns end up with the cab driver?
The police sent him away with the fact that he couldn't be discussed with him on the spot because he put out a bill.
And that's going to be, I think, a problem with that court (six taxi drivers and one ex-officer).
On the one hand, there's gonna be a cab driver with his receipts, on the other side of the police.
However, according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the magistrate may not use secret car taxi recordings as evidence in court.
When I filmed parts of their scams, the taxi drivers themselves warned me of this precedent.
I've always wanted to use the footage only in the report.
Do you have any fear that this fact could protect them from a court of law?
I hope every judge understands that no taxi driver could ride six or ten kroner a kilometer because he wouldn't eat it.
You were talking about a ten-point trick that the underwater taxi drivers, especially in front of foreign clients, are moving.
Is it still up-to-date, or are they worried about this figle after publishing your reports to keep using it?
I think we've popularized this trick by broadcasting the show.
I had a cab driver recently, bragging about being the honest cab driver.
But then I noticed a black sticker on the side of a taximeter.
When I asked him what he had, he said, "You know what it is."
When fines didn't work too well on the taxidermists, could the court and their colleagues warn them?
Is there anything that can dissuade them from deception?
You said they'd always find a way to cheat.
I don't think he can turn them away from anything.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are fair cab drivers who should fight harder to get them out of there seriously.
From my experience, I have to say that the fair cab drivers in Prague are, fortunately, predominate.
But are they willing to go against those who corrupt the reputation of their services?
They taste, but they're missing the mind.
They don't know much about it, and they can't exactly say what they want.
When they organized the demonstration (because of a proposal for a general restriction coming from the office of Prime Minister Adriana Krnáčová), it did not sound very clear what they wanted.
They once said they didn't protest against Uber that they just wanted to have the same conditions as this service, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
The result was that they just blocked Prague and only the best commercial for Uber came out of it.
How do you generally evaluate the access of the Prague Magistrate to address the problem of overrun driving?
You can see that she had to go to the crime police to solve something.
The Magistrate was short on it.
They had a mole that was leaking information, which means that the taxi department was doing their job for a few years completely useless.
I hope that the official will report to the last inspection all the lost controls to make him realize what he's done.
I think that's the worst thing about it.
I even took one check-in ride with him, which I found only from their schedule.
The last series has been published for several months.
What's the response?
I mean, foreign viewers, more than the series actually is the focus.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I let them go.
And then when we go to the Old Town Square, it's a surprise that the same people that are seen in the footage are really worth it.
Infamous Prague celebrities.
But seriously.
I'd have built a shallow around them to make people watch them.
Museum of Communism right on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you drive a cab when you need it?
Sure.
I'm going on services that I don't have to pay cash, but with a card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago, where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also many controls that are fair.
I've only had a cab on the street once since.
The driver said to me after he got in the car, "Well, you have the courage."
I'm in disguise as an Italian tourist.
The fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were reported in 2005.
In the same year, former Prime Minister Pavel Bem set out on a check-in ride in a dressing room for an Italian tourist, and at first tried, his driver cheated on him by two hundred.
Editor Rubes had worse experience.
The taxi drivers charged him with driving from Old Town to Václav Square 820 crowns, which results in approximately 195 crowns per mile, as reported by the authors.
The Prague Magistrate at the same time set a maximum price of 28 crowns per kilometre.
There are also other surprising sums in the recorded reports: for example, a two-kilometre journey from the street of Paris to the Truhlářská stála tourist 400 kroner.
The expensive ride was also provided by taxi drivers waiting at Karl's Bridge.
They charge about six hundred crowns for driving to Angel, which is a mile [2.5 km] away.
The marble is mainly washed with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry and as much longer as possible, the better.
Dispersions from it go well, although sometimes dirt must be given down by scalpel, it must be extracted from folds.
It's not easy, and it's not going fast, Vanessa Trost's restaurant from Oldřichov in The Hague got closer to her job.
The hat down in front of it: the tomb is framed by the scaffolding, after which it is necessary to climb and climb again countless times.
"The restaurant should be careful, patient and difficult to deal with," she stated.
It's not her first restaurant job far away in Frydlant.
Thanks to it the restoration of stone elements of the facade in the rear tract of the Frydlant Town Hall, the statues of St. Mary Magdalene in Zátiší, St. John Nepomucký in Frydlanta, Piet in the Friedlant Circle Street, Mariánský column in Frydlant, or atlants in the New Town under Smrk.
The reconstruction of Melchior, Krysztof and Kateřina from Redern started in Frydlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements from the application of impurities and curds is cleared, the loose stone parts are secured against the fall and shift; either they are anchored into the wall or to each other.
It also awaits treatment and preservation of the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be gold again.
"Then it begins with the gold stamping on marble boards by drawing gold," said the U.S. State Memorial Officer at Frydlant Věra Sobotová.
There are no records from the past that the tomb could have been repaired.
Closer to the eye are the openings drilled in marble columns.
They're hundreds of years old and they're left behind after the gravestone.
He was richly decorated, unfortunately, after the arrival of the Swedes in the Thirty Years' War, everything disappeared.
Literally the tomb of the eyeballs, noted by Sobot.
In the church St. Cross finding are restaurants with a small ceiling like home.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to repair the tombs, which were found underwater, to restore the baptismal room, the walled paintings in the tomb and now the tomb.
"We would also like to sail into the future," said Sobot.
The church is otherwise in a very good condition, we invest money every year in maintenance and repair.
Restaurant work on the reconstruction of the redernov tomb will total up to 128 thousand crowns.
They will be rewarded with grants, the city will not put any money into this part of the recovery.
One hundred thousand crowns will go out of winning the regional round of the historic city competition 2015, the remaining 28,000 crowns is the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, explained Mayor Dan Ramzer.
The representative decided to release the prize for the restoration of the grave.
Expert opinions on future developments in selected foreign markets monitored by indices and compared to the Czech capital market (PX) in the horizon of one month and a half year.
Low volatility and growth prevail in markets.
Who would have said that by the beginning of the year?
The US S&P500 index, which has been going through 12% of the corrections in February, is now at a new historical maximum and has been attributed 7% since the beginning of the year.
Again, the iron rule is confirmed that traders should never, in the long run, oppose the interests of central banks, which have finally reached their own.
In a situation where US stocks are at a historical maximum so again, the volatility which is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets have grown satisfactorily and fearlessly thanks to the quantitative release of the US Central Bank and when, like today, the volatility index (VIX) has remained stable at 12 percent.
And so be it.
Although the Fed continues to prepare for a gradual increase in interest rates, quantitative easing in Europe and Japan is in full current and last week the Bank of England has also added a hand to the work, which will buy bonds in the next six months in the amount of £70 billion.
The new wave of quantitative release thus pushes the lower yields even further and contributes to the almost complete elimination of risk and fear from the future.
How long will this condition last?
That's, of course, a million-dollar question.
At the moment, however, there are no risks, the world economy is going through almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation in the commodity market, and China is stabilizing and brisking is no longer essentially a topic, so we probably shouldn't be too surprised if American stocks continue to survive in a similar calm regime.
Too bad Juncker's not studying Klaus!
I am very glad that my friend Michel Barnier accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted this difficult work of an experienced politician, said Head of the European Commission Juncker, when a French politician (really experienced, because he had lost so many of the most international political functions that a better example of the so-called European elite would be difficult to look for) appointed Great Britain's main negotiator of the European Commission's exit conditions.
Juncker's choice of colours hopes it is in the EU's serious interest to seek the form of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
But most British media accepted Barnier's name as Juncker's war act.
Barnier is a rock European federalist.
Great Britain hates it.
As European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was responsible for reforming European banking law.
He understood it as he could only be understood: the confirmed enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of the free market and the capitalism model.
The advocate of multilateral regulation was a co-author of the so-called banking union concept, and he had a grudge against everything that came from the London City Financial Centre, and he promoted legislation to overturn the hard regulation of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the dispute with London, will be a tough, unbreakable and apparently reckless negotiator.
That's probably not good news.
How not to mention in this context the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, which has contributed so much to the balance, insight and empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus.
That is why today Czechs and Slovaks can be closest friends and allies.
Too bad Juncker didn't learn from Václav Klaus - at least in this.
It would be good for everyone!
Earthquake around Putin?
The ruler of Kremlin released his closest Ivan.
Russian President Vladimir Putin released Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the presidential office on Friday.
Anton Vajna will take his place.
She informed the Russian media of this by calling for a Kremlin press release.
Putin, however, indicated that Ivan's release at his own request.
In a meeting that was broadcast by the television station Russia 24, the president said that he was going to meet Ivan's wishes when he joined the office that he wanted to be head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
He also announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The report on the exchange of President's administration, which will now be led by Ivanov's present representative Vajno, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, 63 years old, is considered one of Putin’s closest associates.
For example, this former KGB officer in the past held the post of Minister of Defence and Deputy Prime Minister.
The chair of the president's Security Council will now leave.
However, Ivanov, in his meeting with Putin, pointed out that the duration of the stay at the head of the administration of the state chief was actually a record man.
It lasted four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that, 25 years after its establishment, 11 people had already changed in this function.
Quilt or Uncle's deblists won't play the finals.
So far, none of the Friday tennis matches have been successful in turning into a final event.
As the first battle, Petra Kvit lost, who gave in to the Puerto Rican surprise Monica Puig after sets 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
After a while, the Czech deblists Shafářivá and Střícová followed.
However, the winners of the Williams sisters were in the first set after winning, but they wasted two sets and the Russians eventually took advantage of the set in a short game.
The second hundred then lost in a ratio of 4:6.
Half the success in the morning program in Rio was marked by Czech rowing: skifar Ondřej Sinek won his semifinals with an overview when the second Damir Martin from Croatia defeated him even after being released at the end of almost a second.
Today's good, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I was trying to save as much as possible, said Sinek.
His rivals, unlike him, had to fight for a course.
So it took them some strength, so it might be easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's going to be easy, it's just playing cards for me, said the Duke of Prague.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková did not walk in Snyka's footsteps.
The 15-year-old rowgirl took her fourth position in today's semifinals on her ride, and on Saturday she was expected to start at the B finale and fight at the 7th to the 12th place.
The gold in London doesn't go off like that.
For the first time in the Olympics, I didn't go to the finals.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I drove a high-quality race, and I put everything I could into it.
The rivals were just better, the Topinková Knapková leaned in front of them.
She fought to the end and believed that she would win her fourth game between the elite six.
The fight gave up just before the target.
I knew the girls were even, that anyone could come out of that field.
I was surprised by the Chinese woman that she had such a finish.
And I thought through Rakusanka I could get into the finals.
Unfortunately, there was a life race today, she told the 2011 World Cup.
Far behind the final gates in Rio was a young shot by Filip Nepeichal, who could not even get away for the second time from the qualification, this time the malaise in the bed.
In it Nepeichal occupied 33rd place.
The qualification was best given to the Russians.
From the first line came Sergei Kamenskij with 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigorjan (628.9).
Nejhal's shot was 620.5 points.
For the first time in the program in Rio, athletes, including Czech seven-man warriors Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová, also spoke.
The Cachs belong 11th place after the second discipline of the Olympic competition, Czech recordwriter Eliška Klučinová is twenty-two.
She leads Britka Katarina Johnson-Thumpson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimeters as well as the other Belgian woman Nafissato Thiam.
They both took care of the historical best high-level performance within the seven-fight.
They tried to jump 201 centimeters, but failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
When we look at the absurdity of the question asked: German society has gone through a deep self-reflecting, although Russian is not.
In the 20th century, dictators appeared in both great Eurasian nations and came to power regimes that were inhuman, brutal, and terrible.
Russian Bolsheviks from 1917 to 1989 contributed a great deal to the 94 million victims of Communism, cited by the Black Book of Communism, whether it was daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent war management or non-human experiments.
The Nazis have wiped out about 6 million Jews in an inhuman way and the total sacrifice of World War II is estimated at 60 million.
In occupied or abandoned territories, they carried out atrocities against the Germans and the Soviets.
In Germany and the USSR, it was not only a few individuals who were guilty, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes, whether actively, passively or only by putting the head into the sand.
This is not just the specifics of these nations, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany, the end of the war came with denation, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
Most important, however, came later.
When the children grew up, they began to ask, "Daddy, Grandpa, why did you take part in such atrocities?"
How could you!
This has brought real reflection and healing to society.
The German elites have so far sought mainly the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they certainly do not want to reconnect with Alsko-Lotrinsko or someone - to rematch - military attack - perhaps everyone will recognise it.
After the Cold War lost in Russia, there was no great reflexion.
The window of possible positive changes was finally closed at the turn of the millennium when former KGB officer (sic!) Vladimír Putin reached power.
The often criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
Putinovsky Russia's policy is rematch, conquer the lost territories, humiliate the West.
Health, prosperity, and the future of our own people are of no value to the Supreme Court.
Fight yours, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only those decades of despotism that the Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - predestined to Asian (self) tyranny.
Who gets the tension growing around Crimea?
Ukrainian Army.
The situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in Crimea has worsened in recent days and hours.
Who is the growth of tension?
After a long period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia deteriorated again.
The Ukrainian side was replaced by Crimea peninsula, which was connected more than 2 years ago to Russia and is part of its territory.
Of course, the reports from both sides are contradictory, and it is difficult to verify them independently, so we have the opportunity to think about an old-fashioned question to whom does this benefit?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which, of course, Ukraine rejects and accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
A well-known response to the arrest of members of Ukrainian special forces in the Russian territory came from the case of the Savchenková pilot that they were allegedly abducted in the Russian territory.
If we joined the Ukrainian version, what would be the benefit of Russia’s worsening situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only damage Russia, mainly by the West in the form of further sanctioning and strengthening the anti-Russian campaign.
In the past year, the immigration crisis in Europe has come to a standstill from the situation in Ukraine.
Ukrainian leadership has already completely lost its credit in front of its inhabitants, with the current support of President Poroshenko moving around 15%.
Ukraine’s economy would have long been bankrupt from being generous financial injections by the EU and mainly the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to pay close attention again to its country in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputations in front of the voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the forces again want to show themselves as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia.
It is not to be hoped that all those who try to provoke an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will eventually realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers but all ordinary people on both sides of the enemy and stop their hostile actions in time.
Bulgaria's first inflation in eight months
National statistics show that the monthly rate of inflation reached 1% in Bulgaria in July.
This is the highest value for several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October of last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0,2 % was published.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the CPI index, was -0.8% in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016 and the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The rate of inflation since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual rate of inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, there was an increase in the pathways of these consumer groups: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and normal maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
At the same level as the previous month, prices remained for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
The U.S. Secret Services reportedly watched Russian hacker attacks for a year.
Information on Russian attacks came to the public last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was dealing with attacks on the servers of the party headquarters of the Democrats.
However, no official report is being mentioned about the Russian share in the attack.
Moscow denied any part of the attack.
The report on the monitoring of the alleged Russian attack was top secret, as it would reveal that US secret services are monitoring and detecting a hacker attack could also be how they do it and what resources they use.
Two Russian intelligence services were reportedly involved in the attack.
New Cyber Security Advisory Board
Russian footprint tracking material was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters wrote.
Only a small group of eight senior Congressmen, known as the US Gang of Eight, were informed by public figures.
It's composed of both Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the presidents of the Democrats in both Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid chambers, and four members of the Congress's defence and security committees.
President-in-Office of the Democratic Party Donna Brazile announced on Thursday that she is creating a cybersecurity advisory council to "prevent future attacks and ensure top-class security for Democratic Party servers".
There was a dangerous parasite in a smoked salmon from Albert.
The grid apologized.
On the basis of the consumer's incentive for health problems after food consumption Losos wild smoked - pieces 100 g, consumption date 22.11.2016, Prague hygiene checks were carried out in the shops Albert on Václav Square and Na Můstek.
The check found that batch L23012562/T4 with the date of consumption 22.11.2016 was no longer available and therefore the product of the same batch with the date of consumption 11.12.2016 was collected.
The laboratory examination was confirmed by the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
This is the parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammals.
It is dangerous for a person - larvae in the body cavity or muscle of fish are a strong allergen and a man caught live larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, said Štich.
Customers are very sorry about the problems with this brand product.
We immediately removed this batch from the sale and, for preventive reasons, we downloaded all the other batches of this item.
There was doubt on the side of the supplier we were dealing with, and at the same time we let this product be tested, told the News speakers Albert Barbor Vanko.
If a customer buys this product, he can return it to any of the chain stores and get the money back.
The larvae will destroy the frost even a sufficient heat treatment
The seller was Nekton - Return.
They informed the Prague and Central Bohemian veterinary administration of the existence of a dangerous product.
According to the server, immeasurability of food may be affected by an anisakisis, which is manifested by severe abdominal pains, vomiting and nausea, or disease can be performed without the symptom, said the Czech Republic.
Symptoms are delivered up to an hour or two weeks after consumption of insufficiently heat-treated fish.
After three weeks from the start of the disease, the larvae usually spontaneously leave the digestive tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to higher and low temperatures, therefore they are killed either by sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or by freezing it.
Veterinars have also checked salmon for imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples examined had parasites in them.
The shipment arrived 1700 products to the Czech Republic by the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) in early April.
It was unloaded, in the very majority in the Achilles chain, to date, 919 packages.
Currently, the product from the shops is being withdrawn from unsold supplies, spokeswoman, SVS Petr Peichal, said on Friday.
Immediately after finding positive samples, veterinarians prohibited the dispatch of other products from storage.
17-year-old Brittany wanted to flee from Rakka, probably killed her with a Russian hit.
After initial enthusiasm and a quick marriage with a jihadist who was killed instantly came sobering up.
The expected halifat paradise turned into hell for the British girls on earth, from which there was no escape.
According to relatives, the girl was in contact with her sister Halima.
She's been calling Britain repeatedly, and she's convinced she wants to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape Alcatraz.
They have orders to shoot without making any sense, quotes The Telegraph as the family lawyer of the deceased girl Tasnim Akunjee.
The last clues led to Rakka, the last thing the girl called from there.
Then all she got was a report about her death, which can't be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in East London.
Together they discussed how she could get out of Rakka and cross the Turkish border.
They were hoping to meet their former student again.
But Kadiza was probably killed before she could escape because the house in which she stayed was compared in May with the country’s air raid, the British ITV News reported.
TV added that the bomb apparently dropped a Russian plane that attacked an IS tower in Syria.
You'd carry the blues out of the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasni Akunjee, a family lawyer.
On the week when she (Kadiza) thought of fleeing the territory of the Islamic State, one Rakušanka was caught in an attempt to escape and was publicly killed, according to the information available.
I think that (Kadiza) explained it as a warning and decided not to risk it, according to BBC Akunjee.
Family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana and her 15-year-old friends from Shamimou Begum School and Amira Abas took their trip on 17 February last year.
The only thing they said at home was that they were going out.
However, they headed for Gatwick Airport and from it through Turkey to the territory controlled by IS.
The girl's family, according to the lawyer, did everything she could to get Kadiz back.
You could take the blue out of the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, and this family did everything she could to power all the power to get her daughter home.
However, it was not possible without risking being caught, the lawyer added.
The only positive thing he believes is that Kadiz's fate can serve as a deterrent for other girls or boys who are left to be fooled by Islamist propaganda.
"There are many cases where people went there, realized how things are, understood how far it differed from the promises of the propaganda of the Islamic State, and wanted to come back," Akunjee further stated.
The fate of Kadiz's classmates is unknown.
But since they have also been silent, their families must accept that they are most likely dead.
To jail for money.
In Scotland you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries the village of Inveraray was a regional center and the headquarters of the Duke of Argyll.
From the mid - 18th century on the town hall there have been courts and basements under the hall serving as a local prison.
The conditions in which the prisoners survived were sad and many prisoners attempted to escape.
Many of them have succeeded.
Therefore, city officials decided to move the prison premises to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more welcoming to the prisoners, heating and gas lighting.
In any case, it was not in service for a long time, it was closed for economic reasons already at the end of August 1889, because the smaller repair equipment was costly and did not pay too much.
The tales of ghosts and ghost chases.
For the public, prisons opened centuries later, visitors can compare the old building with the new one to convince themselves how different conditions existed.
Time - costume guides are still strengthening the authentic experience.
There is also a torture room in which visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to criminals, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
During the tour, tourists may be allowed to close to one of the cells, mostly because of the photograph on the monument, or to instruct themselves about the feeling that prisoners are living behind bars.
In addition, the Inveraray Prison is one of the most famous Scottish sites where they are reportedly afraid.
Several groups of paranormal activity hunters have appeared there, and the museum still allows people to come hunting ghosts.
That night, however, will be worth 300 pounds, which is recalculated by about 9,500 crowns.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the village also attracts great food, nearby panoramics and history.
"Animé" effect on Snapchat is criticised as Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by an animation, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
The Snapchat app allows about 150 million users to change reality every day and to play with the identity of ways that borders on absurdity.
You can make yourself a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that comes out of Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies every day.
Any mistake will be made public immediately.
Snapchat filters have in the past earned criticism of the fact that the application promotes blackfacing or that it supports the white shades of the skin as an ideal of beauty.
So when she offered the users this week a filter that made them want eyes, curved teeth and puffed faces, some critics called it the racist cartoon of the Asians - "yellowface."
And they asked if these repeated issues pointed to a larger problem of society - a problem with diversification.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it and news and anger spread rapidly and Snapchat the next day indicated that he had canceled the function.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as an expression of the accounts to the figures of the animation, not as a cartoon of the Asians.
But observers who witnessed racism were reminded by the filter of painful stereotypes in action.
The others, without any packaging compared to the animes, refused.
Grace Sparapani, a student of American art in Korea whose tweet about photographs was widely shared, said in an e-mail that the filter was "at least harmful and embarrassing".
She added that “it is difficult to argue against comparing the obvious Asian caricature and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not only about yellow face (yellowface), but that the yellow face is drawn into a despised extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has exceeded these cultural limits.
American culture seems to have an endless struggle with diversity and inclusiveness, from meeting halls in corporations to Hollywood and equipment that we all carry in our hands.
And a huge number of young people in Snapchat - who are more racially diversified than their older partners - can mean that even more sensitivity can be expected.
"When one Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to one user," Katie Zhuová, a 25-year-old, said on Thursday in an interview, "only very difficult to get around these things today without noticing what they used to be."
Katie Zhuová, a product manager and designer working for Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her account on Snapchat and invited others to do the same.
In her article for Medium and in her interview on the phone, she said she was convinced that racially motivated problems reflected the lack of diversity in recruiting staff in Snapchat.
Katie Zhu was critical of the predominantly white, entirely male leadership of society and the article ended with the hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either that there is no diversity between employees and color people at the moment they decide on these things," Zhuová, who is of Chinese-American origin, said, "or there color people work, but not in positions to feel safe or comfortable to talk."
Other observers share her view - a complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish the figures relating to the diversification of its employees by having the statutes of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of his employees, but according to the spokesman, a recruiter was recently accepted by the company, who should focus on the under-represented population and internal inclusion management.
Zhuová adds: “I’m wondering if they really need other users who can say that it’s not right,” with the fact that their account will remain cancelled.
Army officers have distorted intelligence about IS, says Parliamentary Committee
In a report issued on Thursday, the Parliamentary Committee stated that the officers of the United States Central Command changed the reports of the intelligence service in order to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than what events had been provided by the country.
According to the preliminary report of the working group drawn up by the Republican Chairman of the Committee on Armed Forces, the Committee on Intelligence Services and the Defence Sub-Committee, there was a finding of "great dissatisfaction" between central intelligence analysts, according to which their authority changed their assessment of the US effort to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as CentCom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press release states: “The reports of intelligence secret services approved by Centcom officials usually offered a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than confirmed by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analyses obtained from other parts of the reporting community.”
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are damaged when misanalysis is presented to the chief politicians," said Ken Calvert, a congressman and a Republican from California.
A failure in the leadership of Centcom goes to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the continuing problems of the Central Staff in describing and analysing American efforts in training the Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although no decisive evidence is offered that the top officials of Obama's administration ordered that the reports be amended, it is stated in the report that analysts had the impression that they were under pressure from the leaders of Centcom to present a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by the Islamic State, or IS.
"In the first half of 2015, many press reports from the Central Staff, statements and statements from Congress were significantly more positive than what events actually were," the report states.
For example, the representative of Centcomu publicly stated that a major military attack on the takeover of Mosul could start in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is clear after months of investigation," said Ambassador Mike Pompeo, representative of the Republican side of Kansas, in a statement.
Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, top-ranking U.S. headquarters intelligence officers were handling the output of the headquarters intelligence services with a view to Bagatelizing the risk of IS in Iraq.
The Republicans have drawn up a working group after learning about the concerns of analysts that intelligence services concerning the Islamic State are being manipulated.
After the report published on Thursday, a more detailed examination must follow after further investigation.
Further investigations by the Attorney General of the Ministry of Defence are under way in Centcom's intelligence services.
Democratic members of the Committee on Intelligence released their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the conclusions of the working group of Republicans.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a very narrow process for compiling the evaluation of information on IS and the Iraqi security components," said the representative of Adam B. Schiff, Chairman of the Committee and the representative of the Democrats.
According to Adam Schiff, this process “has led to the distorting of intelligence services,” he damaged the morale among analysts and“ has not sufficiently taken into account conflicting views.”
However, Schiff and the Democrats argue that they have not found any evidence that the White House would try to push on Centcom's analysts to adjust their conclusions according to "proposal or political situation".
Preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times informed of an ongoing investigation into the General Inspector of the Pentagon, which was initiated following complaints from analysts in Centcoma.
Commander-in-Chief Patrick Evans, spokesman for the Pentagon, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the parliamentary report, as the Inspector-General's investigation is still ongoing.
He stated, however, that "the experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these fundamental issues of national security."
The investigation has an impact on the question of whether the United States' leading bombings in Iraq and Syria are successful (a statement now declaring the increasing number of defence representatives).
However, last year's indictment raised questions as to how President Obama might rely on the Central Staff to honestly evaluate military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The reporting critic of the Islamic State has been reflecting the conflicts for more than ten years, when the intelligence analyst of Centcoma Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper stating that the administration of President George W. Bush - despite opposition from many analysts - defended a small unit in Iraq and devoted little time to thinking about what would follow the invasion in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting Islamic State intelligence services.
Last year, the authorities announced that the Hooker team had concluded that despite the public statement of the opposite, the air strikes against the refineries of the Islamic State had not significantly weakened the financial resources of this terrorist group because the group had built temporary refineries and sold oil on the black market.
The Times informed in September that the findings had not been passed outside the headquarters.
Commander Centcomu, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then subjected to criticism last year after many legislators found the Senate's testimony to be too positive in the evaluation of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel in Centcom.
The US won the ground hockey game in the fourth round, so today it's gonna be a decisive game in the UK team.
Katie Bam, in a match against Japan, who ended up winning 6-1, shot three goals and only one day later, for the American women's team of ground hockey, shot the first two goals of the match, in which America defeated India 3:0 on Thursday.
Five goals in two games is a success of good memory, but Bam (27) said she was not sure if she had ever succeeded.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those who write down their goalbooks.
But he knows this: Americans at the Olympic tournament lead to games 4:0 and share first place in the group with the United Kingdom, which remained undefeated on Thursday after the defeat of Japan 2:0.
Great Britain and the United States face each other on Saturday in the last round match.
Both teams qualified for the quarterfinals, and the match will decide which team of six will end in number one and who will end in number two.
The team in the first place is avoiding the strong Danes, who are at the head of the second group for a little longer.
Whatever Saturday's game is over, the Americans here started their surprise ride, four years after they ended up in 12 teams at games in London.
Bam was on the team, too.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and a hockey game took her first to her hand when she was 3 years old (her older twin sisters played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player ever.
The 2008 Olympics missed her because she didn't get to the final song.
Then came 2012, when neither she nor the members of her team were very successful.
The next year the coach was appointed Englishman Craig Parnham and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
In London, we didn't have the pace of work that we have today.
We've made a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bam started in the first half by shooting the goal in a nearby bekende.
India entered the game without winning the tournament, but the team proved to be surprisingly tough and kept score 1:0 until the end of the third quarter when Bamová took the opportunity.
She ran off on the left side of the playing field, then she clicks into the middle and shoots the ball into the goalie to get the Americans to lead by 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added her last goal to the mid-fourth quarter.
Disposal of the goalie American, Jackie Briggs, who, in each of the three victories, helped one goalie, was at all the first in the tournament.
He's in excellent shape.
Just like Bam.
"Now we are in a good place," Parnham said, but how good it is, it will depend on the outcome of the Saturday match.
Zen trampoline in the middle of an olympic rage
No matter where you are, no matter what time it is, the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro make you feel persistent, indescribable and passionate about altering competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic torch itself is a hot steafet ring that's passed from a watermelon to a swimmer, a gymnast, and a triathlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the news, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in front of the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the inflammation between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then Logan Dooley is, too.
Dooley, the coming lover of women with cheeks in their faces, is on the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names appear in households in the main broadcast time between advertising and sponsoring spots, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a cheater.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in jumps at trampoline.
The Olympic fire doesn't shine at all competitions either.
Far from Wednesday, a bit in the shade are sports that are not generally recognized: shooting from air pistols, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always be successful in the classic swim style - and will probably rule for a long time.
But if I may appoint my extraordinary favorite, let me draw attention to the inconspicuous charm of a trampoline.
Although jumping to trampoline is an Olympic sport since 2000, when they were first introduced to games in Sydney, after 16 years of intervention this sport remains almost without notice - many of the people I questioned or did not know that it was an Olympic sport.
It could be regional indifference.
The US has never won a medal in jumps on trampoline, and by 2012 none of the athletes had even reached the finals.
Prices in the male category are usually divided between China and Russia and in the female category between China and Canada.
This year, the London gold medals will be wearing Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennanova from Canada.
But the trampoline jumps have more bad luck, partly because the unsacred ear will appear to be more suitable for a clown university than for an olympic.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, but only an admirer watching from the country.
It has the comic potential - comic vibration of infinite reflection - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, two sports that it combines.
The word “trampolina” is derived from the Spanish “el trampolín” meaning “skokan board”.
The aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them up to a height of almost 10 meters and shows up with several elements (salts, screws and combinations) before they finally land on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to implementation, difficulty and “air times”.
In Rio, there will be 23 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is ahead.
The warriors of the gold medal must go on, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes there and back, up and down.
They try to reach not only the target tape or the starting wall, but also, as the television news reports, another imaginary line: the world or Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, admirable, a little fanatic - and enough to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it's kind of exhausting at the same time when you're watching the Olympics.
The trampoline jumps in this regard bring relief.
The track athlete on the trampoline is up.
The point is not moving forward.
He or she reflects, as if they were in a state without difficulty as astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again effortlessly up.
Without the competition and, of course, it is not difficult, but during the duration of the assembly there is no fierce struggle to achieve the goal, no measuring distance, but only perfect, fine time strain and gravity.
This is just the closest thing to the Olympiad and Zen.
Qualifications and finals of women take place on Friday afternoon, at 13 o'clock in the east, then on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC station will broadcast the finals within the afternoon block, which starts both days at 14 o'clock.
In the middle of the Olympic madness, they promise a quiet, pleasant moment that you will probably overlook over the other battles.
And if the attention is to be achieved only by the fact that male athletes will be the subject of beloved views and weight loss - as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested by the U.S. gymnasts - then Logan Dooley only waits for his new fans to catch their breath.
Protesting Generations in Ethiopia, United States long-term ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have encountered violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that many protesters were shot during clashes with the police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
In the past decade, it was one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
Over the past months, however, the country has been plagued by counter-government unrest, which has spread to more and more areas.
In just the last week, thousands of people have gone to the streets demanding fundamental political change.
According to organizations fighting for human rights, the government's reaction was merciless.
The witnesses say the cops shot and killed a bunch of unarmed demonstrators.
On rolling video recordings of protests probably coming from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, members of the security forces are caught beating young people with needles after being forced to stand at the wall on their hands.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is now requesting a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and take a step forward will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, project leader Horn of Africa for the International Crisis Group research group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is supported by the West.
The US military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopia to eliminate the danger of terrorist attacks in the area, particularly in Somalia, and few from African countries, if any, are receiving such assistance from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia has developed at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly - even a new suburban train drives in Addis Ababa's capital.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - organisations fighting for human rights without stopping talking about government repression - opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many were denied, imprisoned, killed, or banished far into the desert.
That, however, may change.
"If you suffocate people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a breakthrough," said Seyoum Teshome, who teaches at the University of Central Ethiopia.
He's protesting all youth.
He's been protesting for generations.
There is a lot of trouble and everything about land disputes after absolute control of the power of the ruling coalition.
After last year's elections, which were widely criticised, the ruling party and its allies gained the last seat held by the opposition and now controls 100 percent in Parliament.
At the same time, the pressure on the border with Eritrea is increasing. The conflict along this faulty, controversial border has claimed hundreds of lives in June.
The Anylics fear that separatist groups, which have been repeatedly suppressed over the past years, such as the Oromic Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit and re-arm themselves.
There are a number of factors that explain why these bitter feelings have rekindled now after years of snooping under the surface.
The first one is seemingly harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social networks for up to a few recent years, where cheaper smartphones have become available and Internet services have improved.
And even if the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as is usually done mainly during protests, many people can still communicate through Internet proxy that hides the position of these people.
Several young Ethiopians talked about how they were gathered at the protests.
Further, there is a greater solidarity between Oromy and Amhara, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
Oroms and Amhars are not natural allies.
After centuries of Amhar, mainly from the Christian peaks of Ethiopia, they stood out in politics and commerce and used the Oromas, many of whom are Muslim and live in the lowlands.
But that also changes.
"We are on our way to unified leadership," said Mulata Gemech, leader of the Oroms.
The biggest protests took place in the areas inhabited by Amhara and Oroma.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is wrongly dominated by the Tigraj ethnic group, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and controls the army, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of unrest is the death of Meles Zenavi.
Zenawi, former leader of the rebels, was the Ethiopian Prime Minister for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he succumbed to unspecified diseases.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see by the corner.
Analysts say that he was particularly skilled in detecting the initial signals of dissatisfaction and using the ambassadors to process and acquire opponents on his side.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge," said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was pulled out of relative ignorance in order to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that the result will be further bloodshed.
Finally, Ethiopia experienced such unrest in 2005 after thousands of people protested what analysts had called the elections that the government had robbed and then stolen.
A hard hit followed, during which many protestors were killed - although less than in the past months - and this period of unrest has passed relatively quickly.
Development experts appreciated Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new suburban train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
Of course, it is quite obvious that a gradual increase in disputes within the Ethiopian government did not stop it.
And there's dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protestors in the Amharic city of Gondar attacked trading companies owned by Tigrejians and the tensions against the Tigrejians on social networks are becoming more common.
Analysts say protests put US and other Western allies at a disadvantage.
The American government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone crossings over neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently stated that the base was closed.
While the West wants to unequivocally support democracy, at the same time it does not want its ally to fall apart in such an ongoing area.
"That," said Abdi, "is a very sharp edge of the blade."
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and IS financing as "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to Bagate the latest controversy that overwhelms his campaign by saying that he didn't mean it when several times this week insisted that the president of Obama and Hillary Clinton were the founders of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
The clarification raised new questions about the ability of the Republican candidate to speak clearly to the American public.
He also puts his advocates in a difficult situation, who were eager to defend him in turbulent times and must explain that he may not have been serious about his remarks.
After this motion at a meeting Wednesday night, Trump confirmed Thursday's statement and in the talks he insisted that he really had no intention of saying that the President and H. Clinton's IS had created.
However, in a Twitter post on Friday morning, Trump said he was only sarcastic.
The paper was the opposite of an old claim just one day when Trump said in several interviews that he meant the contrary.
When conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump ease the remark by reminding us that Obama is trying to destroy IS, the Republican candidate did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes when Trump tried to focus his campaign attention on the economy, while his preferences in pre-election polls decline.
Trump and Clinton participated in a duel on economic issues in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to this subject.
On Twitter, he again warned that Clinton's proposals were linked to tax increases and said that according to some, her speech was boring.
Trump used sarcastic defense before.
At the end of July, when he collected the wave of criticism, when he made a suggestion that the Russians should enter Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his remark: "I am obviously sarcastic."
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and to moderate them as necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing, to what extent some reports have a response from his supporters to find out how they react, and then one way or the other, he "explained," said Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist who followed the language that both candidates used.
However, I also think that he is resilient in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to explain them differently.
Because the results of the election polls in his favour continue to decline, Trump chose an even more inflexible tone in the last days, instead of taking things down for general voters.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, which was published on Friday, showed that Tump is with great distance to Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very closely behind her in Florida.
Trump is even trying to avoid excuses for provocative statements he says, but often he blames his criticisms for misinterpreting his words or failing to understand his sense of humor.
But along with Trump’s increased attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, they put Trump’s jokes into the unpleasant situation of his loyal followers, who must stand behind him publicly, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former New York City's mayor, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate on Thursday in an interview for CNN.
"I believe that what he says is a legitimate political comment," Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that in front of Obama the IS was almost unknown, a small organization that he called entirely wrongly a novice, and it was because he withdrew his armies from Iraq.
Most common republicans try to argue that the Obama government, in which Clinton acted as minister of foreign affairs, allowed the IS to rage and fail to cope aggressively in the Middle East.
Prior to Friday’s meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued on Twitter to squander fire on his own for changing every word of his word and being engrossed in him.
He laughed at the "bad, pathetic" television students who tried to understand him and said, "They can't do that!"
Several Democrats with Trump's apology have lamented that this is just another proof that the presidential office is not fit.
The coffee shop was pushed out of the price market. Now it returns to Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe cafe was a lousy place in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee has been served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a store that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells soaps in the form of cakes.
Locals have mourned it as the last loss of a growing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea's hotel is shut down, and Verb's shop is a soap shop now. ”
But if New York is a change, then it's also a revelation.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
New Verb has wifis and receives payment cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee's still good, too.
The manager of the new Verbu is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original cafe, who is also the owner and executive director of the new place.
In Verb he started in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of his customers offered to pay him to move to a new place, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things the way they were.
Verb still has the same pastry supplier and bought the same model of the espresso machine.
He even used the old Verba lighting again and again.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
The offer includes ham, eggs and cheese and toppings, such as capers and fried onions.
You will also find bowls of brown rice here.
The coffee shop no longer offers beer, but offers you fresh fruit juice.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of original samgasts.
"A number of original customers also had to move from Williamsburg for prices," he said.
Last Sunday there was one of those customers, Rebecca Oliveir.
Mrs. Oliveir (34) lived in Williamsburg and often went to Verb Cafe.
She even got there when the coffee shop moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed down, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found out that what I love is coffee and culture in Verba," she said.
Now he drinks coffee again, but on that day instead of his usual ice coffee, she gave mixed chai, another news.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-standing customer, has been loyal to Verba since 2003.
He walks before work and always orders the same thing.
"In the fourth and eighth of every day, like clockwork, I will come and prepare my staff for me with everything and butter," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the offer.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually does, but sometimes he leaves everything with bacon, eggs and ham.
Rodriguez said he wasn't sorry that the soap business took his old place.
The truth is that Soap Cherie's owners offered to make Verb a special soap and use a filtered coffee from the coffee shop as an ingredient.
"I think we could still use it," Rodriguez said.
Also traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint coffee shop accepted well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place where he would soon expose it to make his new neighbors feel at home.
The new place has other advantages.
Local fruit juice manufacturers want to fold in bottles and sell filtered coffee.
There is a possibility that the coffee shop will be extended to the adjacent building.
A lot of customers are enough to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the coffee shop closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says when the coffee shop opens up again, you go in and get coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depressive food from a time of crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after joining the President's office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and lunched.
President Roosevelt's Labyrinth tasted the selected 5th Avenue dishes, like a duck from the geese of the liver and a shark's soup.
His menu for this day, however, was more modest: an egg for the devil's way in a paradise sauce, a potato pyra, and as a dessert of plum pudding.
"It was an act of cooking solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also a message for Americans to eat.
A couple who live in Brooklyn Heights are devoted to gastronomy history.
Andrew Coe's latest book, "Chop Suey", was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane, in her book "97 Orchard", tells the story of a residential house on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work "A Square Meal" published by Harper on Tuesday is history of American cuisine during the great economic crisis.
They showed themselves cooking solidarity and met with a reporter at Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a small, sharp buffet in Flatiron district, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a grilled olive sandwich, Andrew (57) gave himself a turkey, a mashed potatoes, and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meat carbunate, which, according to a couple, seemed to have been very good at talking about food during the crisis.
"The cartons were very popular," said Ms. Ziegelman.
It was sold in peanuts, liver and beans.
They were made of that mixture and other cheap foods that adjusted the ingredients.
Stop the amount of peanuts you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe's grinning.
"They would lie in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served in the form of a snack buffet.
Teams of women cooked for farm workers and breakfast, lunch and dinner served fresh baked cake.
They were Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "And Square Meal" watches the way the nation dealt with the fact that suddenly it was not a land of abundance.
"It was the time when the food became a central, feared point for the American people," Coe explained why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Just as feared was the new budget diet: mystery foods, such as carbanates and castrated dishes, castrations as “an amazing way to use the leftovers,” Ziegelman said, as chefs could hide unaesthetic ingredients under the cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - after many years of central American food point - has become a meagerly allocated luxury.
Strange mixtures, which were to serve as a caloric and nutritious fill, were preferred to taste or even to a healthy mind at cooking.
During the research for a book that contains recipes, Miss Ziegelman prepared a daily onion meal filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a favorite addition to the evening table," Andrew Coe said.
Jane Ziegelman stressed: “It was surreal.
Peanut butter and onions don't go together.
It was typical of a lot of home recipes.
Like never before and never after, domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, the Sherm of the Federal Office for the Domestic Economy in the years 1923 to 1943 - ran the eating habits of the country.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, called on women to take over budget burdens, and chili, such as creamy spaghetti with carrots, turned into delicious foods.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical lusts.
First of all, snacks were created in response to the government's hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's late "let me have a pie".
While publicly praising the simple Jewish farm kitchen of his childhood, he stood as the chosen millionaire to whom he had become.
"It was good to eat continental cuisine such as fish with cucumber sauce," said Andrew Coe.
He ate in an almost outlawed room, had a tuxedo on him.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistakes if his wife Eleanor hadn't forced him to go for an example with his own stomach.
As the book says, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in the taste at all, and this led to the White House “not giving almost the most delicious food in all of Washington, but also in the most uncomfortably prepared way.”
A number of eating habits from the time of the crisis disappeared as the country got back on its feet.
The link remained in our constant study of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science applied to cooking.
A few say that during the writing of the book they better understand the eating habits of Miss Ziegelman's mother - perhaps why she couldn't throw out the food.
"She was really afraid of wasting food," Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled: “The people were wrong about her. ”
There's been an accident with the wreaths.
When Eisenberg had a clean table, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home: a plumb dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called Swedish cream," Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give humble recipes the elegant names.
There was no cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly turned a spoon into a thick brown matter.
Surprisingly, it was bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as a good husband, he said to his wife, "There would be some chopped hairdressers."
Europeans: Migrants go for benefits.
Most refugees who migrate to Europe come from economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
This is how the series would look if we did it.
A group of Russian artists who call themselves 2D Among Us are making fun of their native country.
They use a photoshop to create collages that make it look funny to show what it would look like if famous TV shows and movies were filmed in Russia.
Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of legal representation expenses in the case of a patent against hepatitis C against Merck Group
The district court ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to pay the fees for lawyers that were incurred in the process of patenting the C-type jaundice patent against Merck & Co Inc.'s drug manufacturers.
In June, the judgment that Gilead should have paid 200 million for damages in connection with the violation of the two patents of Merck in connection with the very successful medicines of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni was annulled, after a federal judge found repeatedly illegal negotiations on the part of Merck, among other things lying under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman stated in his file Thursday that Gilead is entitled to waive the fees incurred in connection with the representation of the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for new generations against hepatitis C, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck complained to each other and claimed to be the owner of basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, an active component of the medicines from Gilead.
US-backed military units claim to have gained full control of the city of Manbuy
Military units supported by the United States gained full control over the northern town of Manborg near the border with Turkey after the last fighters of the Islamic State fled the city, put a speaker group on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now sweeping the city after the departure of the rest of the group of radicals hiding in the city.
The troops released over 2,000 civilians, whom the radicals detained, told Reuters Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and the Manner military council.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching it," said Reuters.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent
Hillary Clinton published her 2015 tax ruling on Friday, stating that the presidential candidate for the Democrats and her husband had income of $10.75 million in that year and paid a real tax of 34.2 per cent.
The Clintons spent $1 million in charity in 2015, mostly on the Clinton Foundation. President Bill Clinton contributed to the joint money by almost $5.3 million for lectures, and the former foreign minister admitted an income of $3 million from Simon & Schuster’s publishing house for his book on his foreign ministry.
Clinton's co-candidate, US Senator Tim Caine of Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton, published a tax confession in 10 years.
They paid a real tax of 20.3 per cent in 2015.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine continue to be a model of financial transparency,” said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton with the campaign.
Against this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdraws from his earlier promises that he will make his tax confession public.
It is customary for candidates for the President of the United States to make their tax returns public, even if the law does not.
Trump, a New York trader, and his lawyers quoted the audit of the tax department of the U.S. Treasury Department as a reason for his refusal to publish a tax confession.
"Your move," Hillary Clinton's campaign promoter said on Twitter and applied for a tax return to the Democratic candidate.
Michael Cohen, a special advisor to Trump, said on Thursday CNN that he would not allow Trump's tax returns to be published until the audits were completed.
According to Trump critics, among whom the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican side, agree that his refusal raises questions about his net profits, contributions to charity, commercial transactions and various other relations, including relations with Russia.
Clinton is very active on the issue and released on Friday a video in which she recalls how the high status of the Republic on Trump insists that he publish his tax returns.
He mentions the question Thursday in his speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all the other candidates have done to the presidential office after a decade - to publish his tax confession," she said in front of people.
Politico stated that Trump had paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times journalist quoted a number of tax advisors and accountants who claim to have done so at present.
Federal tax rates have become the theme of the presidential election.
Clinton enforces the rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett, which would ensure that all who make more than $1 million a year will pay a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffett called on Trump to meet and exchange his tax returns in the state of Nebraska, where Buffy's Conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based.
Buffett said he also went through an IRS audit and Trump was "fearing" the financial office, but the voters.
The Clinton campaign published tax returns until 2007.
On average, the Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid a federal tax of 32 per cent on average and a combined tax of approximately 40.5 per cent on average between 2007 and 2014.
According to Clinton's 2015 tax return, unlike most Americans, they make only $100 in their wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which Clinton received dividends and interest of $109,000.

Chill-filled condoms or elephant protection fireworks in Tanzania
Natureists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going to human habitats - they throw condoms filled with chili powder on them.
This process was followed by the Honeyguide Foundation, which came with the idea several years ago, together with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes this process and educates volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, as through this violent procedure in four steps to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Many of them used spears earlier in their defense.
Friday is the world elephant day devoted to protecting these animals.
"Since the development of this ... set of tools, we have noticed a change in behavior in these communities. People believe much more that they can keep elephants out of their fields without being hurt," the executive director of the Honeyguy Damian Bell Foundation said in a statement.
The first step and the second step is to light the battery on a passing elephant and start the horn.
If it does not discourage it, the so-called chili cloud will be discarded.
The chili powder mixed with salt and the petard wraps up in a condom, and the end wraps up so that only the duke can look at it.
After the blast, the condom explodes and a fine chili powder is sprayed into the air.
Most of the time, one curtain is enough, and an elephant appears in a different direction.
The last option is to detonate the fireworks, which will cause a loud, clear explosion.
The Jewish director leaned on the Berlin Hotel for removing the code for calling to Israel to the "request" Arabs - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin triggered a riot in the media after he found that the Kampinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not have a code for calling to Israel, according to the staff member on the basis of the "request" of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the documentary film on the Holocaust ‘Shoah’, vented his frustration at the Hotel Kempinski Bristol in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the list of phone codes at the hotel.
However, the State was not listed among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital city of Germany, Israel was removed and deleted?
He wrote Lanzmann.
The Kampinski Bristol Hotel instead offers the opportunity to call Israel via its own call center.
The director was looking for an explanation and had a problem turning to the hotel reception.
Lanzmann’s answer, according to his words, “has shocked him. ”
The hotel worker replied that the measure was “decisiond after considering the management of Kempinski Hotels”.
The reason for this step was even more compelling.
“Most of our guests are Arabs and they asked for Israel’s calling code to be deleted," Lanzmann quoted an employee as saying in his letter.
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung Ambassador of Israel in Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman referred to the case as "a great shame".
The performances were horrified and shocked.
It's an awful shame of itself.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and, in addition, in such a hotel chain is even more disgraceful.
There's no need for another explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event sparked a strong reaction online, people labeled it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kampinski hotel simply “lost” in the demands of Arab customers.
"Hanba to you," says another post, which points out that the hotel, located in the noble street of Kurfurstendamm, stands near the synagogue.
According to Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly went to any charge by calling the event “overreview” and “excusing” Lanzman.
“No direct order has ever been issued” does not include Israel on the Call Code List, quotes Suddeutsche Zeitung as the representative of the Kampinski Hotel.
It adds that the code for calling has been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber projectiles against protesting Brazilian students
A clash of students and police took place in the Brazilian San Paula on Thursday when students met at a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
The anti-protest police used tear gas and rubber projectiles.
The problem was threatened when government officials tried to dissipate the students, which ended with the police using rubber projectiles and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstration in order to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals of the Governor of San Paulo Gerald Alckmina in order to save money is also the closure of nearly hundreds of public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the participants in the demonstration could see them spraying letters against temporary President Michel Temer on the wall.
The latest protest comes only a few days after the protesters took to the streets to support President Dilma Rousseff's meeting when the Senate decided to sue her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan increased after lifting sanctions between Moscow and Tehran by 70.9 per cent year-on-year trade turnover.
As the Ambassador said, since the International Sanctions against Iran were lifted, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies trading in the country.
Russian companies are renewing existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Another expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
It noted that during the first five months of 2016, the turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period for 2015 and reached $856 million.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent and reached $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The leap increase in trade ensured the supply of machinery equipment, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagarayan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
In the past year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly travel visas, to citizens of Iran.
In addition, Iran got between the top 20 countries for the first time according to the number of tourists coming to Russia.
You can safely say that record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia from last year will be overcome," he said.
At the same time, however, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians.
"I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization are in good condition," he said.
Scottish Callum Skinner rushes home after the British have won gold in cycling
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the hall of fame last night in the men's team sprint on the Velodrome in Rio when the team's VB trio defended the London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old Glasgow native was in the role of a brake he took for his Scot Sir Chris Hoy, and the young legend rejoiced when he reached his destination and stole the victory from the favoured New Zealand.
Britain won a surprise victory four years ago, and Hoy won five of his six Olympic gold medals.
And the same trick was repeated after the end of the humble sixth at the world championship in track cycling in March, even though Hoy ended his career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement for Jamie Staff's specialised starter.
Hindes appeared just in time.
After Hoye left, a place was also released, which he tried to fill out the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was a champion with Hoy four years ago - and with Skinner reached the Olympic record when he qualified, but the tricot took over New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won gold in the team's sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind his wheel, but Kenny's team pushed forward and Skinner kept the lead.
The change of strategy was a major part of the transformation, when Hindes went to a higher transfer to slow down and allow Kenny and, in part, Skinner to keep pace.
The Hoy race watched from its position the BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes stepped on the stage, he kept his eyes out of them.
The 13 - year - old Skinner, a family member from Glasgow, said: “It’s a flattering comparison. ”
I'm here to get the best out of me and honor my name.
We created an Olympic record in the finals and we defeated the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
After the triumph next to Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he had fallen on the track on purpose after a weak start.
He later withdrew the note, and the rivals of Britain had no way to appeal.
This time, there was no such problem around this victory.
Hindes said, "With all the British flags on the stands, I felt like London."
In the last three months, we've all been together as a team.
We've lost in many of the world's races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for the nation, which won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be the indicator of progress in the past five months, then we have a successful five-day row waiting.
With the form that Kenny presented, it is not unthinkable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at one olympiad at the same time.
It would then be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy - to be born on 23 March (this date seems to be sacred for British sport, this day celebrates the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - meant a total of six gold and one silver medals.
Just as much as Hoy got.
As another one, Kenny will participate in a sprint that starts today and lasts for three more days.
An eight - year - old from Bolton said: “Now I enjoy this one.
Team race is always the best.
You win with the others.
To tell the truth, winning for yourself is a bit lonely.
Hindes said: “If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knight's title. ”
That was the only medal race that day, but the British were expecting more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doul qualified as the fastest to race teams for four kilometres.
Ended with time 3:51.943.
The World Record, which fell in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and finals (22:42) take place on today's second day of the race, on which Wiggins will truly focus.
Yesterday, before the qualifying race, he debated with the commissioners when the referees called him to measure his height.
In a similar race of women that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker, and Katie Archibald of Milngavia reached the world record with time 4:13.260.
The VB team relied on its strong track cyclist team and controlled the middle period of Olympic games and gained a lot of medals.
After truly exceptional performances, showing absolute superiority in Beijing and London, it decreased during preparations for Rio.
There have been dramatic events in the background, most recently the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April for charges of sexism and discrimination, and the end of a career of giants such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of the velodrome race, the legendary reputation that the team of Great Britain is able to make a top performance with perfect timing seems to be confirmed again.
The uncertain future of a Portland tavern after the end of the energy supply contract
The future of the Portland coal factory in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power plant which the company supplies electricity and which informed about the intention of one of the owner of the factory to terminate the electricity supply contract. All contracts on electricity supply are expected to be reduced.
This step is followed by the decision of the Government of Victoria earlier this year not to extend the granting of subsidies that the undertaking maintains in the course of its operations.
The validity of a solid 20-year grant expires in November.
Alcoa Portland may be in danger of up to 2,000 jobs.
Up to 2,000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk of closure.
And since the factory consumes about 10 percent of the total produced electricity in Victoria, there may be other avalanche effects.
Alcoa closed the Point Henry tavern in 2014, which led to the closing of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's warehouse in Portland is bulky and is threatened with closure.
This step follows several years of speculation about the future of the company, originally in response to a strong Australian dollar and recently due to the prices for the production of the plant.
AGL, which supplies electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Valley of Latrobe Valley, stated that it expects that one of the other three owners will also decide to terminate the contract.
The main owner of the plant is Alcoa-Alumi Joint Undertaking, small business shares are held by CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp.
"AGL expects the Portland race to continue, in other words, that the demanding demand for electricity from the tavern will continue," she said.
AGL stated that the contracts were so-called ‘insuring contracts’ which were to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period so that they will actually expire in 2017.
"AGL continues to assume that the contracts will participate in the profit for the fiscal year 2017", said the power plant.
Any possible impact on AGL’s profits since fiscal year 2018 is currently limited due to the strong outlook for the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already written the value of contracts according to its accounting books of $187 million “in case the termination would take place”.
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contract “does not affect its ... ability to operate the factory or to secure supply of electricity to the factory.”
The American company stated that in 2010 it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which was to start to pay since November of this year, even though it still had to explain why it had resigned from the contract.
Analysts are very careful about the possible closure of the Portland tavern in Victoria and Tomago near Newcastle due to a weak economy in the sector.
Operation manager AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts at the beginning of this week, said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago around 900 megawatts a year.
If both of these companies were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a substantial reduction in demand on the market [electricity].
It would not be good for us as a manufacturer," he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the reality TV show Kardashian - now is the cover of the glowing Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of mother-mother of clan Kris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the cover page of the coverage of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, the Embassador of the Estee Lauder brand, who showed at the fashion weekend in Milan, Paris and New York, announced news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, when I look at this headline, I want to cry," Kendall wrote.
The disclosure of the title page was followed by bizarre (or simply continuation of humor in Kardashian?) staged video in which the whole family of Kardashian-Jennerse (the barber robbers Rob and Caitlin and together with them all the favorite uncles from the show, the producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest). They forgot on the cover of their sisters just so that the scene could end with a classic twist: they are preparing a secret party.
It is a played action line almost every "birthday" part of children's television show (Seacrest broadcasts: "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit on the show at eight o'clock in the morning), but Kris needed to make sure that the other girls in this audience could feed.
Because when we look at Vogue's glow magazine number, we have certainly entered the new Kardashian era.
Senior Sister Kim may have pushed Kendall on the cover of Vogue (she was on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the title of the September issue of the magazine is another league.
The September issue of the magazine Vogue is the most sold issue of the year.
The publication, which resembles a book for advertising purposes rather than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionist estimates that of the 832 pages published last year there were 615 pages with advertising content).
The discovery of the star that appears on the title page is unexpectedly expected, so it is no wonder that in the past two years the photographs of the magazine have escaped before its official publication.
Among the women who have appeared on the cover in the past are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista or Kate Moss.
In recent years, the title page has certainly appeared more “celebrity that make models” than “models that are celebrities”.
Jennifer Lawrence, holder of Oscar and Ambassador of the Dior brand, appeared on the title in 2013, a year later she had the honour of Laga Gaga.
But even though it is very unlikely that Kendall - which magazine describes as her generation's "principal model" - will fall into the first category, it will be in a very good society.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, nor stars of reality shows, or children today who know how to make well-cut videos (even if Jenner represents all this).
They are demonstrably talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the page last year, had one of the strongest years in her career due to the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is excited about Jenner's success.
Her position in fashion world will always be difficult because of her participation in reality show.
Stephanie Seymor, the original Victoria's Secret model in June, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called them "girls of the moment".
These feelings rekindled with the news that Jenner would appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this dissatisfaction isn't in place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of glowing Vogue.
It's a supermodel in the right sense.
He plays for Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you make up from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their own webs.
She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter who took pictures of LOVE magazine.
And in free moments, he's acting on reality show, maybe only as one way to see Courtney and her kids.
Community Legal Aid Centres will reject 160 000 people per year
More than 160 000 of the most endangered citizens are denied legal aid in community centres every year, and in the sector alone they are preparing for the consequences that will have further restrictions on the funds for the already overburdened service.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly people of advanced age, immigrants, men at risk of violence, victims of violence, and people without funds to fight unjust evictions and so on - are denials as soon as they seek free legal assistance and representation.
Community legal services, which are so tight to crack, are about to make further cuts.
Since June next year, these legal aid centres will lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
The Director of Community Centers of Legal Aid in Queenslad James Farrell said that according to the latest summary report of the National Association of Community Aid Centres, five thousand people were found to be rejected each year.
Mr. Farrell said that without cancelling the federal government's decision, the situation would deteriorate.
"The community legal centres in Queensland are chronically sub-financed, which means that thousands of people are denied the vital services they need," he said.
People who have avoided relations with the rapist, people with excessive and protective debts, families going through separation, workers who are unjustly released - all these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
The federal government will reduce funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, leading to the need for more thousands of people at risk from Queensland to be aware of complex legal problems without help.
We call on the prosecutor and Senator Queensland George Brandise to immediately prevent this financial cuts from getting people to get the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
In the past year, the government has been given its commitment to ensure that legal aid is financed up to the level of the national average.
Now it is time to look at the needs of the community's legal aid centres and the community of their clients and the Palauan government must invest in this important work.
The action against the Donald Trump campaign after a staff member allegedly targeted a weapon
New York: The Donald Trump campaign was sued for alleged inaction after being told that the director of operations in North Carolina in February put a gun on a staff member during the jeep ride.
The incident was described in a court file, which on Wednesday at the State Court in Charlotte handed over Vincent Bordini, a former software campaign teacher.
Bordini said that he had waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before he concluded that “it will not happen”.
Director Earl Phillip “marked the fingers of the gun, gave the right pointer on the trigger and pointed the head at Vincent’s face”, said Bordini in his lawsuit.
The file states that Bordini, following complaints from local and regional campaign leadership, found that at least four others had experienced the same experience with Phillip.
“Weapons do not need to fire to cause damage”, said Bordini in the action.
The appeal came only two days after the Republican presidential candidate had been cheered when he told the voters in North Carolina that they could move in the owners and arms holders (which is regulated in the United States in the second amendment of the Constitution) if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and would be able to appoint his judge.
Trump's campaign says the media pulled his words out of context and that Trump wasn't defending violence.
Bordini in the lawsuit requests compensation from the campaign for careless supervision and from Phillip for the threat of personal safety, the illegal use of violence and the cause of emotional harm.
Trump's spokesman, Hope Hicks, did not respond immediately to the request for a comment.
Attempts to obtain expressions from Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news office in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
A call to his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services has not responded in a short period of time.
The Republican candidate for President Donald Trump is leading a controversial election campaign.

Britain must spread the Olympian spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of recovery and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but throughout the country.
For me, Heathrow is enormously attractive, just as London 2012 was when we made an extraordinary effort to ensure that all our nations and regions can benefit from the Olympic Games.
Olympic games have meant huge benefits for Startford and East End.
And we'll do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
Only for our local communities will we create 10,000 new teaching posts, 40,000 new jobs, and we will end the unemployment of young people around the airport.
As before the London Olympics in 2012, there will also be those who will think that the expansion of Heathrow is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would be laughing at the world stage.
Doubters were wrong in 2012 and even in the case of Heathrow it turns out they were wrong.
Obstacles will always have to be overcome, but Heathrow can answer any question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create 180 000 new jobs, an economic growth of 211 billion pounds, to leave heritage in the form of skills and jobs both around the airport and throughout the UK.
We have on Heathrow a great team, who, in the term and budget, introduced an infrastructure investment programme of 11 billion pounds, starting with a T5 terminal, which was selected by the world's best terminal five years in advance, after the T2 terminal, which was built between the two most disruptive levels in the world.
They are now ready to add a third round, worth 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The games in London in 2012 were a huge success for Great Britain and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow will also be it.
It is time for us to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, secure trade in the future, and leave the legacy of the skills and employment that Britain may be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Deputy for Trade Affairs of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook game on cat and mouse in blocking ads
The attempts to bypass advertising programs have become a game for cats and mice for online marketing companies. At least this is claimed by one of the companies that program such software.
On Thursday, that is, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus published a contribution on its website stating that users can update the filters in their program and re-block advertising on this social network.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop website will change coding around advertising to make advertising filters more difficult to find which parts of the site are advertising.
But now Adblock says the new codes have already been bypassed.
Adblock Ben Williams, speaking in a blog post, wrote that “this kind of war between the community of open source blocking advertising and those trying to bypass it has been going on since the blocking of advertisements was invented,” and that Facebook is likely to come up with another self-repair.
The fact that the world's largest social network has become involved in the war merely demonstrates how big the problem of blocking advertising for industry has become.
According to the study, Pagefair performed last year and Adobe uses around 200 million advertising filters around the world - almost four times as many as it was in 2013.
Mobile advertising is now reaching 84 percent of Facebook advertising profits, and Facebook from mobile devices is visiting 1.03 billion active users every day.
The speaker said that the company was going against advertising filters on the desktop because mobile filters for mobile applications for the social network and Instagram did not work.
Desktop ads still represent profits high enough to make Facebook decide to invest in it.
Facebook also said on Tuesday that it will update the tool for "ad preferences" to give people a better chance to control how they are shown.
On Thursday, Facebook said that the new Adblock filters concerned them because they could also block content that does not relate to advertising.
"For people, this is not a pleasant experience and we want to solve this problem," said the speaker Facebook in an e-mail statement.
The blocking of advertising is an insensitive tool, and that is why we have rather focused on building tools like Ad Preferences to control people.
A woman was hit by a Swiss highway car
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to an event in which on Thursday morning several cars were run over by a woman who probably tried to commit suicide on the highway.
There was an accident on highway A1 near Morges in the Vaud canton shortly after midnight on Thursday.
The Vaud police stated in the statement that the actor of a "solved act" was in the dark on the road and ran over several cars.
Clearly, the victim, a woman at age 49, wanted to kill herself and hit her with several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been interviewed, but according to the police, they still haven't all been identified.
A criminal investigation was opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, said for Le Tribune de Geneve legal representative Gilles Hofstetter.
It is still necessary to determine whether any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent a collision?
The prosecutor must find out," Hofstadter said.
Based on two similar cases from the past five years, drivers do not seem to be responsible.
In both cases - one of which was a person walking along the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, as the papers said.
Last year, a police officer was released after she hit and killed a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne in August 2014.
The court heard that the victim had been drinking alcohol at the age of 22 and fainted on the road.
The Court found that the police officer - who responded to the emergency call - was in a reasonable way and that the presence of a man on the road was “a totally exceptional and unpredictable situation,” said the judge.
Anyone with information about the quarterly incident in Morges should report to the police at telephone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
It's a tolerant town.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies (AČCKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to visit Prague Pride.
On Friday, the executive director of the AČCKA Kateřina Petříčková reported it.
The sixth edition of Prague Pride began on August 8th, the festival brings the life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT).
Last year, about 35,000 people took part.
"Prague belongs to the most popular destination of the LGBT community, for a high degree of tolerance and a wide range of specialised enterprises," Petríčková said.
According to the organizers' survey, foreign visitors spend an average of 3,100 crowns per person per day.
Gay tourists are encouraged to travel their special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gays and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications, etc.
"To travel generally means that the LGBT clientele is very lucrative, interested in staying in higher price relations with a high standard of travel services and spending more than others," Petríčková said.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium is held this year as part of the festival program.
It is presented by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the USA and China.
The Festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
The main theme of this year is love, but action will also address several thematic areas that are family, prevention of AIDS and transgender issues.
On Saturday, the top of the festival will be a traditional parade with allegorical cars, which will go from Václav Square to Letna.
The parade attended by thousands of people in the last few years celebrates a minute's silence in the memory of the victims of the June attack at a nightclub in Orlando, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Matt celebrate forty years.
The irreversible coils Pat and Matt, whose efforts have usually ended in disaster, have entertained small and large audiences for 40 years.
The pilot of this evening's series by director Lubomír Beneš was premiered on August 12, 1976.
Following the creation of this animated series, which now knows audiences in more than a hundred countries of the world, there were cartoon jokes by the artist and director Lubomír Beneš, who designed two masters Ouholíček and Sedlek for the magazine.
Benesh then called for the cooperation of playwright Jiří Kubíčka and artist Vladimír Jiánek and together created the film Kuťáci.
Today's appearance with yellow and red tricks and cools and radio in 1979, when the series for Slovak TV began to be created in Krátké film Prague.
The names Pat and Matt then the nerds got in 1985, this time it was already going directly for the Short Film Prague.
In 1990 he founded Lubomír Beneš his own studio of animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other works were created.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other creators, many of whom were attended by Beneš’s son Marek.
At present, there are over 90 episodes with the stories of these coils, which are all under their hands, but they are never angry with each other and are always full of optimism, ideas and coultication and finally satisfied with their work, which will present a familiar gesture "...and it is!".
Pat and Matt even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs and theaters and other toys featuring Pat and Mata are a hit of every toy industry.
A story for Fiji and for two-year-old Harmony.
At the end of the week, we've chosen one sporty and one life for you.
They both have a good ending.
Let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole earth?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and she's happy with her.
And what are the most expensive things people spend on airports?
That's Friday's view from the world's websites.
First medal from the Olympic Games.
Historic success celebrates the island state of Fiji.
Ragby's selection of this island was defeated by the United Kingdom team in the finals of the Olympic Cup.
It's the first medal Fiji ever won in the Olympics.
Waiting for the profit of the first precious metal took 60 years from sending the first expedition to the Olympic Games.
Coach Fiji takes great credit for his success.
But it's ironic that he's Brit Ben Ryan.
The team has been leading since 2013 and after the finals as a British citizen could be satisfied, unlike his countrymen.
"Let's go play free and easy and see if we can make the biggest game in our history," said the coach before the finals.
Fiji eventually controlled it sovereignly, and a small country with 900,000 inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
The report was brought by the French daily Le Monde.
A new friend and a good luck for a little girl.
Two-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who's lived with no hands for 11 months and got a new friend.
A doll who looks like her.
"Mommy, she's like me," a two-year-old girl rejoiced as her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter loved the virgins with her hands and legs removed and then sat together without any prosthetics.
Harmony was diagnosed in less than a year of life with type B meningitis, and doctors only gave her a 10% chance of survival.
There's nothing I wouldn't love about her.
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's funny, and she never gives up.
He's got an eye.
I saw her introduce herself to the other kids with the words "Hey, I'm Harmony and I don't have hands, mother added."
Look at the joy of the doll.
What do we spend the most on the airport?
CNN provides evidence that people at airports spend the most on packed water.
The retailer Hudson's travel essential stores has published data in the last year, where it collects 10 products that customers buy most at airports in its shops.
Water was sovereignly the first.
Drinks were generally very popular, and eight were placed in the first ten.
The ninth place occupied a large package of M&M candy with coconut flavor.
And can you guess who's closing the first ten?
One of the above is not to be eaten.
According to CNN, it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among magazines are the US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
The U.S. Sovereign.
We're just going to win, laughing with Murray and Bond.
The rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have sovereignly reigned a category of twins without a helmman for seven years and have confirmed their dominance at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At first glance, a non-serious couple moved to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and since 2009 competed.
In the final quarter, Rodriga de Freitas was awarded the 69th prize in a row.
What are we different from the others?
We're just prettier, joked Murray during the Olympic regatta when he had to answer questions about the New Zealand couple's dominance.
Frankly, we're not doing anything different than anyone else.
We're just practicing hard, very hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their authority is remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray's almost a two-foot and a hundred-pound casino, the academicly-looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
In addition, they have a different nature.
Bond studies and deals with finance, Murray, for example, has a charity boxing match.
He doesn't spend much time without rowing for that either.
Eric's getting into the ship, essentially, with us losing.
We're just gonna win.
I tend to think about what might go wrong, admitted Bond, who, even at the press conference, made it clear that the dominant in the crew is Murray.
He was the one who always responded first and Bond waited for his opportunity.
On the water, however, it destroys its rivals with calm force.
They are driving at their own pace, and although often they are not yet in the middle of the line, the opponents have not yet found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We're racing on a two-mile track, and we never wanted to go the first mile away.
We're just trying to go at a pace that no one else can.
We know what we have to do to win, said 40-year-old Murray.
With his four-year-old partner, he won seven gold medals at the world championship.
They also triumphed in 2007, when they were both members of the gold four without a steering wheel.
Just after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later, they decided to move to a twin without a steering wheel.
Apparently, at the London Olympics, the biggest defeat of their careers was canceled, and the dominants confirmed it in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask anything.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it was gonna be bloody hard, and we had to make sure we were mentally well, put Murray on it.
We know that everyone wants to throw us off the throne.
We still have the target on our backs.
But we're trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once a resident
According to the projections of the new NASA climate model, Venus was once a resident.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to explore Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether at one time on Venus, the surface of which was hot, without water and saturated CO2, could be subject to conditions similar to those of the Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low speed of Venus' rotation can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
According to the latest simulations, however, Venus once seemed to be able to boast a rare atmosphere similar to the Earth and turned slowly.
The model also dealt with the earlier topography of Venus.
The planet was likely dryer than on Earth, but once there was plenty of water and geographical diversity to rule life on it and to provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus had used the sun before, which was 30 percent more suppressed.
"In the simulation of the GISS Venus model during the slow rotation, he exhibits his daily side to the sun for almost two months at a time," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This is how the surface is heated and the formation of rain, which creates a dense layer of clouds that act as an umbrella and protect the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is climate with average temperatures which are actually slightly lower than currently on Earth.
The model built the story of Venus, similar to the evolution that was originally built by planetary scientists.
Even though Venus had probably been inhabited in the past -- over a few billion years -- it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Her oceans evaporated, and the water vapors were burned with ultraviolet light.
The hydrogen has escaped and remains only the dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of greenhouse gas -- that's Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers published their results from the new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigned as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team.
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as coach and vice president of Colorado Avalanche hockey operations, as a reason for not being able to participate in the team's decision-making process.
The Executive Vice President/General of Colorado Joe Sakic has confirmed the step and indicated that the club will start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I served as chief coach and vice president of hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
Over the years, I've been thinking about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs, and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations be in accordance with the vision of the organisation.
They must also be able to participate in decisions affecting team performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who accepted Roye on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patric informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the best league coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to 112 points and first place in the Central Division. However, Colorado fought Minnesota in the first round of play-off and in the last two years he always didn't miss the match after the season.
Avalanche team in season 2015/2016 reached score 39:39:4 and he lacked five points to get the second wild card in the Western conference.
Roy's goalkeeper, who joined the Hall of Fame, won Stanley Cup four times -- twice with Montreal Canadiens and twice with Avalanche.
Oil field workers in the North Sea resume interviews and stop strike
The top representatives of the parties said that the strikes for oil ploy workers in the North Sea had been suspended while all parties to the dispute had gone to a new negotiating round.
The clashes against the oil field service company Wood Group were sporadic in the North Sea platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
‘Water Group and union organisations of the Union and RMT can confirm that they have agreed to resume the process for the current disagreements’, the declaration states.
Starting next week, we will have a series of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at problems from new angles.
According to the trade unions, their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, to protest wage cuts by up to 30 percent.
Wood Group reduced its rates this year and paid its suppliers in the North Sea by about 9 percent less due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in company rates comes after a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company argues that other cuts would provide companies with a place to cope with the market decline.
On the other hand, Shell drew thousands of people out of his payroll and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries due to the modernization of its processes - immediately after the mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of low oil prices, the economic situation associated with Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of this week, a Member of Parliament in Scotland, Dave Anderson, met with trade unions to discuss one of the biggest labour disagreements of the whole generation leading to a North Sea strike.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the economy in the region.
"In the North Sea and in the whole country we need an economy that works for all, not only for some," he said in a statement.
For comparison, in 2016 nearly $1.4 billion is expected to invest in new projects in the North Sea, while the average for the past five years was about $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in Pleiades
The latest mission of Kepler's Space Telescope to help astronomers is to get an almost complete list of the speeds of rotation of the stars from the Playground Starball.
New data helps astronomers to understand why stars in the sky are spinning at different speeds, as well as how time of rotation is related to planetary formation.
"We hope to learn more about the relationship between star matter, age and even history in its solar system," Luisa Rebullová, a research worker at the centre of Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a new report.
Pleiade's starship is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the video are now reaching maturity and have been created for over 125 million years.
They're turning fast now.
At maximum speeds of rotation, these teenage stars release huge amounts of star winds.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
Along with how the star ages, its speed of rotation is slowing.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by measuring the time between the discovery of distinct points on the stars -- similar to solar spots.
According to the latest data on rotational speeds, larger stars are turning slower than less massive stars.
Rebull likens the stars to the dancers, makes bigger pyruetes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the ballet, we see that slower rotating stars are more massive, while those that spin faster are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the fleet of Pleiade is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the quality of stars and rotational speeds.
"The pleiades provide us with anchors for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, for younger and older stars," Rebull said.
There is still a lot that we want to learn about how, when and why the stars slow down their speed of rotation and so to say, "he will hang his dancing shoes on a nail".
Rebull and her colleagues described in detail the latest analysis of the rotation rate of Pleiade in three studies, which will soon be published in the journal Astronomical Journal.
Is a qualification agreement necessary?
If I didn't apply, then the qualification agreement wouldn't be closed, and after a few months I could go to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work without applying for special education after an adjustment?
It is my concern that in the field I would like to work in, there is now a job available only in a somewhat remote hospital, but in about six months, there could be a place where I would like to work.
So I don't know how to deal with the situation for about that half year, the question continues.
Answers Mgr. Lenka Vlková.
There is no legal obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with an employer - a hospital.
The Qualification Agreement is a legal institution governed by the Labour Code and can be concluded between an employee and an employer to ensure the return of the costs incurred in connection with the increase or deepening of the qualifications of an employee.
In the field of health, long-term pressure is being put on not to conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring the labour mobility of healthcare professionals and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Act No 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for obtaining and recognising professional competence and specialised competence to perform medical professions, dentists and pharmacists, it is expressly considered that participation in special education is considered to be a deepening of the qualification (not to increase it).
This means that the qualification agreement may be concluded under the contract of employment only if the costs amount to at least CZK 75,000.
No legislation or obligation to apply for special education.
The law only lays down the conditions of the application for inclusion in the special education field.
However, according to the law, the doctor is entitled to perform a doctor's appointment already thanks to the completion of the required higher education, even if under the legal conditions (under the professional supervision of a doctor with a specialised authority in the relevant field).
The law provides for a situation in which professional training may be included in a physician's specialisation training in another field if its content and scope correspond to the relevant education programme.
In theory, it would be possible to count the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the situation of the carpenter.
