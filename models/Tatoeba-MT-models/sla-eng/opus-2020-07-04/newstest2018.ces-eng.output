The Civil Rights Movement issued a travel alert for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colorful People (NAACP) has issued warnings to colourful people travelling to Missouri on the basis of the discriminatory principles of the state and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Recommendation for the State of Missouri, effective from 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travellers, visitors and residents of Missouri to pay increased attention to travel across the country as a result of a series of controversial racially motivated incidents currently taking place throughout the country," the Association said.
NAACP stated that this step was taken on the basis of the current laws of the State of Missouri, which make it more difficult to defend racistly motivated acts before a court, as well as the conduct of criminal law enforcement bodies that disproportionately target minorities.
"There is a violation of civil rights.
People are stopped by police only because of the color of their skin, they are attacked or killed," said President NAACP for Missouri Rod Chapel for Kansas City Star.
"We still have the greatest number of complaints."
It is the first warning of its kind that the organization has given to the US.
Among the incidents quoted by the organization were racially motivated insults directed against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under disputed circumstances earlier this year after he had been given gas while travelling across the state and was thrown into custody by the police without charge of committing a crime.
The travel recommendation also draws attention to the recent statement by the State of Missouri’s Supreme State, which states that black drivers have a 75 % higher chance of being stopped by the police.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People have to be prepared - they should carry money with them to pay bail or warn their relatives that they are going to travel by the state."
According to current numbers of the FBI programme, hundreds of hate cases were reported in Missouri in 2015, bringing the state to 16th place among all states.
Travel insurance is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it more difficult to sue the company for discrimination in the provision of accommodation or employment.
The US Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has issued a travel recommendation for Texas and Arizona after the States have approved an immigration law that allows state officials to detain people on the basis of a violation of this law, which, according to the ACLU, is intended to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for foreign countries, but recently, lawyers have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family doesn't rest for 12 years!
Sally Anne Bowman's model is murdered.
The girl, originally from Croydon, was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie in the restaurant she worked at, and she was stabbed with stab wounds.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana, and then he killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby coffee shop and watched a careful criminal investigation into the crime scene.
Dixie, former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to take 34 years for murder and rape of Sally's model.
He admitted only a juvenile assault in court, and a lawyer claimed that his client had already found a girl dead lying on the street.
After three years, the police convicted him.
Dixie said Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson had a fight with a fateful night.
The killer said, "He was really upset, and after his attack, the girl started screaming."
"Even attracted the attention of the cab drivers," he lied.
The girl was supposed to defend herself according to his statement, but she could, in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stab her on the street.
Dixie's version was proved as a lie and accused him.
After Dixie's confession, he talked about his horniness and the taste of a girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to light his marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally, he was with his ex-girlfriend, he was drinking alcohol, and they took cocaine, he said it to the police himself, Dexie.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth," the Mirror Linda added.
And after twelve years, the family faces other attacks on the side of the vandals destroying her grave.
He's been hurt four times in the last six months.
There are so cruel people on the loose who dig these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," the Mirror mother told Linda's late girl about the disappearance of the ash urinae.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"The Czechs are not greedy or conservative," says Martin Ráž, who runs the Prague Intimity boutique.
In it you will find design and luxury erotic tools.
Including those from Czech designer Anna Maresh.
It started all over the place, about 12 years ago.
Martin Ráž went on a cycle flight to Moravia with his friends.
One of them brought not only a wheel but also a box full of apparently looking vibrators.
"A variety of brushes and dolphins and all that was green and yellow and just different," he tells me over lunch.
His friend decided to work with another partner to work with the German designer of the Eromatic Fun Factory, which interested Martina, and thus offered to help with marketing.
When an associate left to pursue another profession, he replaced it.
Today he operates in the Prague Benediktská street boutique Intimity, where he sells erotic aids in a way that is usually offered luxury purses or shoes.
And why wouldn't he?
These are also design objects.
Wait a minute, you're talking about this at lunch, you know?
Come on, don't be such a puritan!
It was Berlin's Fun Factory store, which proposed a respected designer Karim Rashid, that served for the Intimity boutique as an inspiration.
They opened it in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic commerce than what they were all used to here.
No covered expositions, everything done in a beautiful, decimal style, products exhibited more like perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdeněk Šebělko began to consider how to take up the Prague trade, where he should be and what name he should be.
The name Intimity liked both.
"It's connected with intimacy, and it's also, you can say, tender," he says.
There was a purchase of Internet domains and a search for suitable space, which paralleled with various interior visualizations.
Finally, the option was won, which spread the shop into the garden of luxury and the bedrooms, whose head of the bed.
She was prepared by Dagmar Štěpánová from the FormFatal studio.
We found the space in 2013.
At first, he didn't seem entirely ideal because he wasn't on the main street, but he was back in the name of the Intimacy.
He's intimate.
It's in the alley next to the main one, so no one is waiting," Martin Ráž praises.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to do a business that would be different, with branded nice goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not that they're ashamed to enter such a business at all.
When I walked into the Intimity boutique half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Besides, I didn't even feel like I'd go to the E.R. store.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the clean elegance of the interior I know from the fashion boutiques.
Even if there's only a woman's service at the store to keep women from asking for help, it doesn't mean that a man's foot doesn't come in here.
For the most part, gentlemen come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men usually can't estimate the right size and choose the bigger," Martin smiles over a frequent mistake.
These are the prejudices, the experienced clichés, that women need some big help, and that's not true.
So a man in good faith chooses an unnecessary big vibrator.
As well, men choose mostly black underwear, while women generally tend to wear pink.
The absolute best seller is currently a product called Satisfyer.
The expression in my face must be clear that I don't know what's beating, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's such a touchless clitoris stimulant.
Pere has an adolescence in me to enjoy the importance of the interpretation given to me.
It's like it's not coming off.
And it doesn't really go well.
It's at a good price and has perfect user references.
We didn't believe he'd be so well received.
It's about the latest revolutionary news.
The first revolution was caused by a seahorse vibrator.
He made sure that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The other was a vibrator for We-Vibe's couples.
He completely ruined the taboo that some men can endure, and the fact that he sees competition in erotic aids.
"Different variants are being made," continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
It's a favorite category.
With a love connection, a woman can have a master in her hand and determine the intensity of vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain failure is the category of attaching vibrators.
At least at our place.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose aids and buy classic vibrators, even though they use it only externally.
However, in Western Europe, especially among younger customers, it is very popular.
What about men?
It's hard to tell if a concept like this would work exclusively for men.
I think it'd have to be a little different.
The question is what to offer men," Martin thinks.
"We also have aids for them, but to a limited extent." The best seller is the masturbator, in this case from the producer Tenga.
It doesn't look like an anatomical likeness of a vagina, but "more like a shower gel or like an egg or a futuristic object.
A lot of focus is on functionality and experience in use.
In Japan, it's completely different.
It makes me wonder.
I thought the Japanese would have a lot of patience with erotic devices, I object.
"That's the Internet reality," I'm told.
The usual is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic tools are rather connected with women using them.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary, they are taboo for women." Just to be interesting - what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimity boutique, sells to the world, is still about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
The Czechs and the Czechs are not ferocious.
On the contrary, we are a whole friendly nation.
Definitely unlike countries such as the Catholic Poland or Italy.
The typical customer of the store is between 35 and 50 years old and "has already had some experience with sexual life, but with some help.
He will come up with something nice, more quality, which would complement his partner's life or himself." Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeněk Šebělko are trying to convince each product to be perfectly functional.
We also don't want to go into the specialities of the type of bondage and latex, because we don't have room for it, but it doesn't fit in very well here.
Things like that could be distracting the ones we're trying to target.
Which is people who have always had sex shopping to do because they're afraid they're going to look at them like that.
A lot of the products on the shelf are really good.
It is also given by the selection of well-known brands.
Some of them even got design prices, including Red Dot Design Award.
The first prized was the mentioned sea horse 'and this triggered a change in the whole sector.
It started to run away from cheap materials and, on the other hand, to work with healthy harmless materials, they began to produce other designs, different colors...
The nice thing is that some of the designs are followed by the Czech Republic, although the popular designer Anna Maresová.
I have to say, I was kind of surprised at how many people in our house have these design things from Whoop.de.doo by Anna Maresh, even though they're relatively expensive.
There are customers who go directly to Venus with Anna Maresh's ball.
She did a really huge piece of work by presenting within the Czech Republic and abroad exactly what we are trying to present - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story began as a schoolwork.
Now it's a finished product, which is also manufactured by us.
I wanted to have a process of production under control, and I also wanted to know what materials were made of and how Whoop.de.doo products were made.
Because it's not a big deal, it's a small series, it's certainly more expensive than a big series.
I may be going a little against the current, but it seems important to keep developments in the Czech Republic.
It could happen that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything," she later describes Anna's situation, which agrees with Martin that our society is becoming more and more open.
He does not encounter a negative or a negative attitude.
I hear people are desperate, as far as possible.
"But even then you will start smiling." Currently Anna Maresová has a vibrator on offer that you can have a personal note, and this year she also plans her own lubricant gel.
The next year, she's supposed to have vibrate eggs and other news.
The Borders of Healthy Sex
I wonder where the boundaries of what's right lie.
Is there anything Martin Raj wouldn't be selling anymore?
It's very hard to define.
What seems normal to one person may seem completely abnormal to another, so we are more determined by the range of branded producers.
None of them go into any extremes.
Before we say good-bye, I have one last question: what was the craziest demand they got?
Just now, an e-mail came in a week, in which a lady asked for a masturbating tool for her boyfriend with a natural 20-inch-long, eight-centimeter.
So we had to write that down, unfortunately, we don't have anything like that.
The question is whether someone has made fun of us," says Martin, with a suspicious view.
And that happens from time to time...
A wound for Karl Gott.
After two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Karel Štedrý is struggling with a serious illness.
Karl Gott's best friend is fighting a disease that will steal people's memories.
"Yes, it is unfortunately true," confirmed the sad information to Blesko by the singer himself.
I know about my illness, and so far, given the circumstances, I'm pretty good with it.
"I'm taking medications to slow down the behavioral symptoms," he added, thanking the loved ones for their support.
The whole divorced family came down to make it easier for Karla to live.
Eve's wife tries to be at home as much as possible, behind her father's home in the White Hora the daughters of the first marriage of Zuzana and Theresa, the son of Karel told Karlas.
He fought cancer twice, and he also handed his experience to Slavík to support his demanding treatment.
She's got 60 chemotherapy behind her.
He was able to return to work for tennis courts and ski slopes.
"From an astrologer, I've been predicted to be here by 90," said Karel Blesk.
He's a fighter.
They still want to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the song so I won't forget them," said Karel.
She's fighting the same disease now in the constitution and actress Kveta Fial.
Do you have a patient with Alzheimer's in your family?
Look at how you treat him.
The Chilean Parliament has lifted the ban on infractions, the law will judge ÚS.
Chile is still subject to an absolute prohibition of artificial termination of pregnancy, so it must not be carried out for health reasons.
"I hate that the legislators have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we agreed on in Parliament for more than two years," Social Senator Isabel Allende complained.
The Chilean Constitutional Court has ten members and, at the end of August, should get a new president who, according to the AFP, is close to the opposition.
The law breaking the absolute ban on infractions initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet approved the Senate on 19 July.
The rightful opposition then announced that the law would attack the court because, according to her, it violated the right of an unborn child to life.
Members of the vote on the draft law postponed last month until it was analysed by the Joint Parliamentary Commission.
In the middle, the Members approved the proposal and then again did the Senate.
According to the new legislative regime, there should be no criminal artificial interruption of pregnancy in three cases: if a woman's life is threatened, if the fetus has no hope of survival, or if the pregnancy is caused by rape.
Similar exceptions existed, according to the Spanish newspaper El País, in Chile since 1931, before women were elected in 1949.
The absolute ban on infractions was introduced in 1989 by Augusto Pinochet, a right-wing dictator, just a few months before leaving the office of the President.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on infractions.
Other are Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
For example, in Salvador, there are now about 20 women behind bars who are serving up as many as 30 years of prison sentences to stop their pregnancy.
In many cases, however, human rights defenders viewed the court as a murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
The target of Trump's White House is now Socha Freedom
Unmistakable sign of a change in the regime is the criticism of the statue.
Americans could talk about it as well as everyone else - see the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Husajna statue on the Baghdad Square of Firdos in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key advocates of Trump's regime, certainly knew what he was inclined to do when, in a heated debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosto on the topic of presidential proposals for a drastic restriction of legal immigrants, he went with a symbolic axe at the Statue of Freedom.
It's good to add that Miller didn't attack the statue like that.
For that he would be lynched by the crowd of owners of the cruise ships and copyists of Socha Svoboda.
But he attacked its significance, specifically the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous poem Emmy Lazarus was placed on the foundation, up to 17 years after the monument was completed.
Miller rebuked Acosta with the words: “I don’t want to go into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that shines light on the whole world.
The poem that has been placed on the base additionally, and on which you refer is not a part of it."
Miller's actually right, but as he said, this isn't about history.
It is particularly about Emmy Lazarus, who is now resonating, who calls them not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poorest: "Let me see who falls, who can hardly breathe freely, who can hardly breathe with the poor worms in the midst of full cities."
And in modern times, we can better watch these "poor worms" on our screens than ever before.
Miller didn't try to criticise poetry - he wanted to make it clear that these people aren't welcome in the US.
This conflict about the importance of sculpture is part of an extensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends who, after her death, sought to put a plaque with poems on the foundation of statues, knew very well that they were letting go of the high political game.
The statue was to express the French and American Republican government's association by representing a classic theme, namely the women's freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this importance: in her poem, a woman figure is not abstract, but has her own voice.
She also has a very different name: Mother of Exiles.
Connecting a poem to the image of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-holder has long sought to reverse that meaning.
The famous commentator Rush Limbaugh - Jana Baptizer in Trump’s entry into power - in 2010 argued that Socha Svoboda is not really inviting anyone to the country, but it represents an early neoconstructiveism, bringing the American flame to the fallen world: “The Statue of Freedom goes on.
It's a freelance torch from the United States offering it to the rest of the world.
The torch is not supposed to illuminate the way to the United States."
Limbaugh comes across something important.
The significance of the statue depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the standpoint of an exhausted and damned traveler, who often after a long and terrifying voyage across the ocean comes with hope in the heart to a new land.
It's literally about looking at the world with the eyes of people looking for shelter and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that's, of course, a perspective that Miller and Trump certainly don't recognize.
Their torch is not to illuminate the way, but to arouse hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black sings praises for Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle remembers when the British team had only two Scottish members
The director of the United Kingdom's athletic federation Neil Black said that the strong suitor of 16 Scots in the World Cup team would be “a huge asset for the team”.
For the MS in London 2017, starting on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes was selected.
Black believes that in Scotland "something special is going on" and British athletics could learn from the Scots easily.
"We're trying to understand and adapt - we're going to work on it," Black said.
"I talked to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British Athletics: It has to do with what they did.
That's what people in the streets think.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will strive for a medal, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sire Mo Farah in the race at 5000 m, while Eilidh Doyle was elected captain of the team.
"Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing," Black said.
“A few athletes, whether Scottish or athletes of other nationalities, came from a room with a sense of great pride and motivation.
The passion and the unscrupulous feelings with which Eilidh spoke were inconsequential."
A silver medalist, Commonwealth, who will compete in the run over obstacles to 400 m at her fifth World Cup, said that it is “unbelievable” that 16 Scottish athletes are on the British team.
The previous 1983 and 2015 record is seven.
In the last year only five British and two European records were established on the medium line by Muir.
The MS will take part in the run at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who runs the track at 1500 m. In this season won the British team races and the Annual Games.
Doyle remembers his first championship, which was the only other Scottish member of Lee McConnell's team.
The captain of the team has led her to be "very proud" of the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues have reached the team, but in many cases they will also attack the finals and medals.
"The extraordinary thing about being captain of the team is that I was elected by the other members of the team. It was a great honor for me, but knowing that I was elected by the team members is a pleasure," she added.
"I'm obviously very proud of all the Scots who got on the team.
It proves where we've gone.
They're athletes who're going to think about the front of the stage.
And my opening speech?
Yes, I think she did.
I just pointed out the fact that we can be proud of this year's championship because it's happening on domestic soil.
It is important to take advantage of the support of domestic fans and enjoy the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance to race and enjoy an incredible atmosphere."
Blocking Facebook Critics: Do not agree on a public function unless you are critical of voters
Our father knew his own criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take them long to start criticizing him for anything, starting with domestic politics and ending with his political opinions.
Yes, this criticism did not keep him cold.
But he wasn't trying to shut up his criticisms.
Because in 1783, Washington said: “Freedom of speech may be taken away from us - and foolish, and we will be led as sheep for slaughter. ”
That brings me to Maryland is the Governor Larry Hogan, who he needs to work on to start acting like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, the American Union for Civil Liberties applied to him for these acts.
The governor's employees rejected the action as groundless and many views of the type “who cares” appeared in the comments on the Internet.
"It's just Facebook," said many users.
Still, it matters.
Especially at a time when it's people like Hogan.
In an absolute democratic state, it is an extremely popular Republican governor.
He can boast of the second highest favorite of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not prolific.
As you can see, his country is governed by its own and strict principles with certainty.
It turned out that it is also smooth in using Facebook as the main means of connecting with its voters - except there is no publication of the first picture with the naked head after receiving chemotherapy.
Blocking people who visit the governor's side - which is a public forum, marked official and managed by his employees paid from taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview for the Washington Post Hogan daily, spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the Governor with the fact that the blocking of comments took place from the position of moderation of contributions.
However, it is too easy to use images of Internet trolls, spammers, or scattered people.
Washington Post interviewed several real people who deleted their contributions.
And that is exactly what they are - real people who speak to their elected leaders; teachers, businessmen and pastor, no trolls.
As everyone said, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
In his commentary, the pastor quoted the Bible as appealing to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer of Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, Md. asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
"I politely noted that I am disappointed by his insufficient response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the section with comments on the Washington Post diary.
"I do not like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same topic, some people are identified as promoting so-called collective efforts rather than being recognised as a larger group of interested citizens."
What the Governor’s employees called “a concentrated spam interest” would probably call others “a defence”.
The modern Facebook era allows us to manage our contributions easily by blocking criticism or deleting negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would require sending employees to the streets where they would collect and burn all prints with criticism or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that's exactly what's going on, just in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public actor to be criticized for defaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing an action by Twitter users who denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
President Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated Judge James C. Cacherise's first addition to Alexandria, where she prevented one of the voters from accessing her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) from Kentucky also awaited a visit from the ACLU for its use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
In Washington's day, the low price of post office practically had the same effect as the Internet.
During the years 1776 and 1800, the number of daily prints was multiplied by four and his position as leader questioned many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People who wrote under pseudonyms such as “Juricola”, “Valerius”, “Belisarius” and “Portius” wrote letters to newspapers and questioned Washington’s decision.
According to the historical documents gathered by the people in the framework of the online Papers of George Washington Project, petitions were gathered in his office criticizing his opinion on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of expression, disapproval and intimidation lies at the very foundations of our nation.
And a real leader has to accept that.
The Czechs quickly used free roaming, using more data abroad than at home.
In the Czech Republic abroad they use more of their tariff than at home.
Most often they move to Austria, but the consumption of data in the summer season is by the Duke of Croatia.
On holidays, however, they have more time to relax on the web, and under the sun they do not usually have the possibility to join the Wi-Fi.
Beach, swimming and smart phone in hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of the local operators at domestic prices.
This results from the fresh statistics of O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travelers abroad have more data in the pausal than at home.
It is not surprising, therefore, that in Croatia, where even 50 times this summer’s data consumption has increased over the winter, the minimum natanas have risen.
Second, Italy placed itself in a collection of used data.
Most minutes the Czechs will call from Germany, where many of them travel in the workplace even during the summer.
Croatia, according to data from the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, will visit 800,000 Czechs a year, so it is our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here exchanged a book for sharing experiences with a mobile phone.
The record was July 7 this year.
"Tens of a million photographs would fit the data transferred," said the director of the mobile segment in O2 Silvia Cieslarová.
Although Croatia leads in the amount of data, the highest number of Czech users is moving in neighbouring countries.
First is Austria, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy is sixth.
We go to Austria on foot tourism and active vacation, for which we don't have that much time on the Internet.
"In addition to Austria, the Czech Republic is heading towards the Adriatic," Cieslar explained.
While the data has been recorded by the operator following the release of the roaming charges of high annual growth, the phone call rate is much lower.
The number of minutes voted in roaming has doubled compared to last year.
Germany dominates the country with great headship.
"Roaming calls are rather used by business customers on business trips," Cieslar said.
Ronan Rafferty hopes in the home atmosphere at the Renaissance Club
In the next three days, Ronan Rafferty’s former golf course will hope for a comfortable atmosphere in Renaissance Club in the Scottish administrative area of East Lothian, hosted by the 25th annual Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, last year on the nearby Archerfield Links golf course in the finals of Paul Eales. This year he will play the role of Ambassador of the tournament in the representation of the founder of the club and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the Renaissance Club grow slowly before my eyes and this year's tournament shows the world its beauty," Rafferty said.
“Players will be able to love a top quality playground.
Jerry did a great job.
He is a zealous advocate of this game and is proud of his success.
This year's tournament is in the right hands."
The Englishman Eales will be defending the championship for the first time, despite winning the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I feel good about it," said the Suthport golfer.
"I had no opportunity to defend my victory at Extremadura Open, because a year after my victory, the tournament was canceled.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful place for golf.
I remember last year when Sharon and I really meant a lot to win.
It was a beautiful time I won't forget."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years from the region this year, returns to his home soil.
This event will be his first attendance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play on home soil," Orr said about Helensburg.
"You want to succeed and feel great pressure.
I really liked playing again, and I think I'm doing well.
I'm happy with the outcome so far."
The three players will also be joined by the former Masters Ian Woosnam winners and the winners of the senior tournaments Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty..
Orr and former challenge captain Ryder Cup Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players on the field; others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmoire and Ross Drummond.
The entrance to the tournament is free. Parking is 5 £ per car with one passenger and 10 £ per car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be paid to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in the land of Indonesia gold
When Barda Degei cooks dinner, he doesn't use stove.
In fact, she rarely uses a pelvis.
In her wooden hut, located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali in the province of Papua Indonesia, a woman usually simply throws sweet potatoes - in the words of the local “tata” - into the fire.
After half an hour, we'll take out the potatoes and taste it with unwashed hands.
Bardin sits on a muddled country - the house is not equipped with furniture - where he also performs his daily work, such as washing laundry in clouded water from nearby swamps.
The strawberry in the room without the roof adds to the toilet.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, she was not assigned any fields for cultivation.
Polygamy is common here.
Work to late night hours is a danger: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In addition, in the village they are resident soldiers.
"In the afternoon after five o'clock no one will be allowed to roam around the village," says Barina.
It is a rare view of everyday life at the height of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was declared as part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote in the form of a public handshake before the occupying army.
The current protest movement against the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which ruled the whole region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, an independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and desolate city, where you can reach after 90 minutes from the main city of Jayapura province to Nabira, and then a five-hour stomach with a sparkling ride.
Mass transport in this place is not working.
The city with 19 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs made of woolen sheets in shades of gray and rusty paint.
Few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners, looked at this place.
Before the arrival of Christians, locals worshipped a god named Uga Tame.
And that's not all.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Barina, pointing to her colorful, hand knit turban, dark shirt and bright dress.
"We used to wear only leaves."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line and child mortality and literacy is one of the worst in Asia.
At the same time, however, it is the Indonesian land of gold.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world of Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of America's Phoenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai - a rocky province about the size of New Jersey, which is home to about 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport earned gold and copper worth $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua supports wood mining at an estimated value of $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of suffering and a guarantee of oppression by the mighty Indonesian army.
An investigation conducted by the New York Times in 2005 showed that Freeport paid local military officials and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one officer.
Those who call for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely suppressed.
According to human rights activists, since 1969 more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass killings in the tribe area of Papua during the 1970s were equal to genocide, as stated by the Asian Commission for Human Rights.
Last year alone, more than 3,900 peaceful Protestants were arrested by Indonesian police in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report from the British Archdiocese, describes the atrocities that took place last year, as extrajudicial executions, torture - according to further reports is particularly popular rape and execution by electric current - and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrators.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because incidents occur every week," said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation was compounded by the fact that Papuan resources are attracting to Indonesia's colonist.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% report to Christianity, but the demographics change with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the islands of Indonesia - Jawa, Bornea, Sumtra and Sulawesi.
Javan canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
"Immigrants began selling chickens and vegetables on traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans," explains 40-year-old Abed You, who was born in Pania and moved for work in the capital city of Jayapura Province.
"The original inhabitants of Papua - Mom (wife) - lost their job."
In his presidential campaign in 2014, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, whose name is Joko, promised a solution to inequality and violations of rights.
The former carpenter secured his journey to the presidential palace in anchor 27 of the 29 district of Papua, including the Paniai.
But in Papua, that changed very little, and local people feel betrayed.
"Our heart was broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi with the hope of hearing our calls for justice," you said.
The fact is that only two months after the October inauguration of Jacob, Paniai suffered a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs at the campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian motorcycle soldiers emerged from the grey of the night.
Two of the surprised kids told them they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was touched by this bulge and tone and later returned with four other soldiers, said local priest Yaved Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in a state of drunkenness persecuted a group of children and beaten them with their arms, reported the victims and witnesses.
One of the soldiers then set fire to a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a nearby election committee building, and the next day things were still going down.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered at a football court outside the local police station and military headquarters and demanded justice.
They came with ceremonial hunting bows and performed the dance waita - in which they run in circles and imitated the singing of birds - the Papuan tribe of Mee Paga.
Several Protestants started throwing stones at the buildings.
With a degree of tension, an order was issued to soldiers over the radio: “If the crowd tries at least three times to resist, you have permission to shoot,” said the TTIME week in an official document whose contents have never been published in the local media.
Yereemias Kayame, 56, head of the Enarothali District of Kego Koto, recognized the looming danger and called on the residents to move into their homes.
No one, however, cared for his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," Time said on the porch of his painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but in his words, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people around," he added.
One of the locals, Alfie Youw, said his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, was hit three times.
"I ran to the body to convince myself that it was really him," said Time week-old forced Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, used only one name.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
The Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only “provided” the station under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten us with death," the press spokesman for Papuan police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistio, said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to the Human Rights Watch, five protestors were killed and many were injured.
The report on the murders was requested by the media like art the following day.
Three weeks later, he gave a passionate speech to Joko in Jayapura and expressed his understanding of the victims’ families and promised to deal with violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so it can never be repeated," he said.
Minister of National Security Wiranto announced in October 2016 that it would introduce an extra-judicial mechanism to resolve the violent acts that took place in the past.
Almost immediately, however, excuses began to come up.
“Most violent acts have taken place long ago.
Some of them occurred in the 1990 ’ s and some in the early 21st century.
I mean that we are determined to punish these violent acts, but it will not be a simple task," he said.
In an interview held in Jakarta on 5 June for the Time week, Wiranto claimed that he was not planning to implement any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that “all cases will be brought before the court”.
Wiranto, accused by the United Nations of “crime against humanity” on the basis of more than one thousand dead during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor - stated that 11 human rights violations in Papua, including the Pania incident, have been settled so far.
The victims' families in Paniai welcomed his allegations of distrust.
"In the last three years, I have been asked a total of four times, but so far I have not expected anything," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," as he claims.
"I'm afraid an army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the sight of many people of Pania who are afraid to talk about the incident.
According to him, he was beaten by members of the army after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After the burial of the bodies, the army began to look for me," he said.
And the shooting still isn't slowing down.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police fired at the villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
The attack in which one person died and another 17 were injured occurred between the villagers and the construction manager, who refused to provide assistance in transporting the man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravianus Dow, 24, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the company.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at them, and the response was a warning shot.
Locals, however, claim that the mobile brigade (the Indonesian paramilitarian police) started shooting in the crowd and killed one person.
"There was panic, we were afraid of retaliation," said Time 29-year-old Domingu Badii, who lives near the hospital and has witnessed the arrival of the injured.
"I didn't leave the house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament called for the punishment of the police involved and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of indigenous peoples of the tribes of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in central heights.
Many have joined the Papaai Liberation Movement (OPM), an rebel army that protects the rights of Papuans by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian police.
Some OPM leaders come from Paniai, not Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks in recent years, the army has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of people in Ganiai, all under the pretext of “insuring national sovereignty”.
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among the people of Papua New Guinea as “a tragic and forgotten place”.
Oil pours poverty into the fire.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And bread is still unattainable.
These people grow their food: sweet potatoes, fruit and leaf vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each of them cultivates four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most harvests are intended for the needs of the family and sell the rest on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire airport opened several air routes and new immigrants began to flow to the country, there has been an increase in economic inequalities between the natives and immigrants.
Even so few jobs will usually occupy more educated and richer immigrants.
Papuan people rarely have the necessary capital and education to go into business.
"Young people move from villages for lack of employment and money," said John Gobai, chairman of the Pania Tribal Council.
Because of isolation, Papua Province is hidden from the world.
Strong rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basile Longchamp - were expelled from the papaya because of “the lack of cooperation with the authorities”, despite the fact that they had received such a rare film permission.
In his election campaign, Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch office of Human Rights Watch, Jokov promised the abolition of strict rules for journalists and the achievement of transparency and development; however, this never happened.
"Foreign journalists working in the rebellious eastern regions of Papua and West Papua are at great risk: not recognising visas and being listed in the black paper," said the statement.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesia in Papua has been limited to a large extent.
In March there were six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council on the investigation of “various and widespread acts of violence” in Papua, including shootings in Panama.
These countries have also supported the OPM in the past.
Speaking to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanata Nasir dropped charges when he told journalists in Jakarta that "In Indonesia, the democratic system is still in force and the media are free, so it is difficult to mask evidence of human rights violations."
Local people are calling for foreign government participation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights envoy Keese Van Baar, visited Jayapurau on 4 May, local people called on the source, who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the password "we want freedom".
Further elections are planned for 2019 in Indonesia, but the Papua New Guineans say they will not vote for Jokowi.
"Joko is a man who has good intentions but is surrounded by people associated with shooting in Panama," said Gobau, chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokko to know that the people of Paniai - except that they live in constant fear of a robbery army - are at war in poverty, poor education and the health system.
Gobai claims that the people of Panai, like the other Papuans, consider their voice to be “a debt ” that must pay Jokus back.
"They do not want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the victims of the Panasian shooting, they continue in the final symbolic act of resistance: they bury the bodies of the victims on the property opposite the police and the military station.
Knowing that justice will never be done for enough, at least it will not allow responsible persons to forget their crimes.
"He was killed by a member of our family," Jacob said with his head down.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy intercepted a huge shipment of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy has detained $1.46 tons of cocaine in the Pacific yacht, worth about $256 million.
The shipment was on its way to Australia.
A four-member crew of a ship apparently made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia was arrested.
The yacht, named Afalina, sailed from South America and was taken to the port of Nouméa, the metropolis of the French overseas territory of Nova Caledonia, in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian intelligence service indicated that it would work in cooperation with its international partners to determine exactly where and where drugs were going and to identify the "Lithuania syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures that have stopped a large number of drugs going to Australia," said its executive director, Col Blanch.
The drugs were destroyed this week in Noumée.
Australia is an attractive target for its smugglers because of high street prices.
The country is also facing a growing number of people with drug addiction.
The current raid isn't the first time lately.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting large quantities of drugs from the United States to Australia, who tried to smuggle across the Pacific in a small plane.
The seniors don't feel thirsty, the drinks have to be remembered.
The problem may be in nursing homes, according to a doctor at the Geriatric Clinic General Faculty Hospital in Prague, Pavla Mádlová could be an infusion of physiological solution, which is injected with a thin needle under the skin.
But so far, they only apply in medical facilities.
The older a person, the more water drops in his body.
"In addition, it loses its feeling of thirst, so the seniors generally accept less fluids and very quickly dehydrate themselves," said Mádlová.
They should drink two liters for sure.
"But getting so many fluids into the old man is a big problem," she added.
In senior homes, she often says no doctor is watching.
In hospitals, they resolve dehydration by infusion.
"I think that even there should be a gradual introduction so that they can get a subcutaneous infusion," she said.
In a day, she thinks that up to two and a half liters of saline can be added to the old people.
Lack of fluid can cause malaise, headache and decreased performance.
Dehydration occurs as a total loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day that old man says he can't get out of bed, he speaks confused," she added.
In case of neglect, it can lead to brain failure.
Blood becomes thickened and the blood clots in the brain, and kidney failure is also threatened.
Lying patients should not be covered in feathers, with maximum cotton sheets.
One-time diapers can also be a problem.
"It's more demanding for the nurse, but it would be ideal to expose the patient and let the skin grow," the doctor said.
In Dubai already burned the second skyscraper The Torch
On Friday, in Dubai, one of the world's largest residential skyscrapers was found in the flames. Hasics had to evacuate all residents 337 metres high and 79 floors.
In the last two years, it has been the second fire of this high-rise building, which bears the fitting name The Torch.
All the residents of the building were evacuated and there was no injuries, the cause of the fire is unknown.
"We were asleep and we were awakened by an alarm. We heard a scream.
It took us ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said Reuters Geroge, one of the inhabitants of the skyscraper.
Dubai's civil defense indicated that the firefighters managed to get the fire under control around four o'clock in the morning (0:00 GMT), although they continued to cool the building.
Government officials have added that they provide replacement accommodation for the disabled.
The incident could once again have a discussion about the safety of materials used to frame high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation initiated by the management of the Torch skyscraper after the fire in 2015 revealed that the most damaged was the siege and outer panels used for decoration or isolation.
The British police stated that the isolation and siege system of London’s Grenfell Tower could contribute to the rapid spread of fire in a red fire that killed nearly 80 people.
The results of the survey showed that more than one of the five passengers to the US carry prohibited items on board aircraft
A survey of passengers has shown that more than 20 per cent of them have consciously or unconsciously carried out prohibited items through the U.S. government control station Transportation Security Administration on board the aircraft. At least six per cent of passengers have boarded a vehicle with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers claim to have been delayed to travel with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
From the results of the survey carried out by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - which was answered by more than 1,000 respondents - it emerged that young passengers are more likely to be in breach of the rules.
Of respondents who admitted that they had tried to travel knowingly with an object prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent of passengers with thousands of hours flown compared to less than 15 percent of the members of Generation X.
Among the most common items that have escaped TSA's attention are food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents consciously spoke through the surveillance of a sharp object, while 2.2 percent of the women questioned and 3.7 percent of the men questioned also admitted that they deliberately put illicit drugs on board the plane.
The company stated that it was conducting research among passengers around the world to find out how many of them accidentally made illegal objects through airport control and how much it did on purpose.
It is not surprising that most people who have passed unauthorized items - whether consciously or unconsciously - travel by plane very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSA Directive is somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often do not know what fluids and how much they can carry to the plane.
It is no surprise, then, that TSA seized most of the banned fluids.
At a certain time, people thought that the TSA would be handling books the same way as the smuggled goods.
The transport of liquids is permitted in the course of domestic flights, not international flights.
Head of EPA Scott Pruitt on the postponement of planned directives to reduce Obama's administration's emissions
After the Environmental Protection Agency had been charged by fifteen states, her boss Scott Pruitt had rejected his earlier decision to postpone the implementation of the plan of the former Obama administration to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt presented changes in the framework of his plan. It responds more quickly than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge against his previous position in the Federal Court of Appeal.
This refers to the last date set for 1 October when States should start implementing the 2015 regulation to reduce the amount of ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the agreement by one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid “interventions with local decisions or threatening economic growth”.
Pruitt, who, before joining the role of head of EPA President Donald Trump, held the position of State Attorney General Oklahoma, served for a long time as a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental regulations.
Since he settled in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or removed the controls proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
The sudden centripetal turnover is the greatest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeal court in Washington ruled that the EPA contractor exceeded its authority in an effort to delay the incorporation of the Obama administration plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leakage.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed his version of ozone standards and strengthened the EPA's commitment to cooperation with States through comprehensive processes and the fulfilment of new standards within a given time frame.
"For the governments of the previous EPA administration, it often failed to meet the deadlines and waited for more than a dozen actions to be filed against the EPA in its previous position.
"We do not believe in regulation by means of litigation and the fulfilment of the deadline take seriously.
We never joke about our statutes and the authority that comes out of it."
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may at a certain point use “the possibility of delay and all other legally available authority” to ensure that regulations “will be based on sound policies and the most accessible information”.
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a wider rewrite of ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to postpone the implementation rules of 2015 by at least eight years.
The measure still hasn't passed through the Senate.
New York's Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who was at the forefront of the coalition of states who complained this week to the EPA that the group was unwilling to allow legal pressure.
"Turning around in EPA's opinions - following our lawsuit - is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6,7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman added.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, D.C.
Ground-level ozone is produced when normal harmful substances emitted by automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resultant smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and every year thousands of premature deaths.
Public health and environmentalists are cheering Pruitt's sudden change with gratitude.
"It is disturbing what pressure we need to develop in order to change the thinking of responsible people and to protect the air we breathe," Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity said.
"We must continue to fight with the ideological pursuit of Trump's administration, which is trying to help polluters and special interests."
He's a man with acid, yet he's not dangerous in court.
You never know what might happen to you.
At one point, you're home with your family and you're laughing, and in the next, your whole life will suddenly change from scratch.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it.
Similar fate met Andreas Christopher of Great Britain, whose face was glued with acid by an unknown attacker who was finally exonerated of guilt.
The information is provided by the Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the door at Christopher's.
Andreas got up, he was going to open up.
He thought there was probably a courier behind the door who was supposed to deliver Christmas presents for the family that day.
Instead, there was a cruel surprise waiting for him.
The man he's never seen in his life, right after he opened up without warning, he spilled acid with the words, "That's for you, my friend."
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell apart on me like nothing, and I felt just an incredible pain on my skin," Andreas said.
The family rushed him to the hospital, but there his loved ones learned a terrible report - according to doctors, he had no chance of surviving.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injuries were very serious.
Of the 90 percent, a face that doctors tried to combine with skin from other parts of the patient’s body was affected.
A great complication for Christopher has become the loss of the eyelids.
It's probably the most painful thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described his suffering.
Today Christopher is behind 12 operations, which are far from the last.
The injuries suffered by the victims of acid attacks may require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment according to plastic surgeons.
Even after demanding and long-term treatment, victims have tissue scarred for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't recover and spend their lives fighting deformation and disfigurement," said Professor Peter Dzwulski, the spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgery.
The attacker was wrong.
As far as the attack is concerned, Christophers is certain that an unknown man must have been confused with someone.
For the perpetrator believed that he was avenged by a man who sexually abused his closeness.
The police investigated the entire case properly, and the attacker followed up.
The man was originally sentenced to a minimum of eight years in prison.
Later, however, the verdict to the amazement of Christopher's family changed substantially.
"The three judges finally concluded that the sentence should be abolished because a man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
Over the past few years, the number of seizures by nutrients has increased significantly.
The Ministry of the Interior expressed its view on the issue by planning to provide new guidance to state representatives on the classification of giraffes.
You should be included among the dangerous weapons.
However, victims of similar attacks do not want to give up.
They demand that the government of the United Kingdom enforce stricter and longer sentences of imprisonment on the part of people who attack their surroundings with acid or other nutrients.
They also require tightened controls on the sale of hazardous substances, which are frequently available in different shops, as they are various cleaning products.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai burned at night the famous skyscraper The Torch, which belongs to the world’s largest residential buildings.
According to Dubai Civil Defense, the inhabitants of the 80-story building were able to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to the spokesman for Dubai police, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread up.
According to several residents of the house, however, this was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," one of the tenants said.
Also, according to another tenant quoted by Reuters, fire broke out in the highest floors and spread down with falling hot burns.
We were sleeping.
The alarm woke us up, the people shouted.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us about 10 minutes from the 50th floor," said ten-minutes.
Another CNN witness estimated that the flames had taken up about 40 flats.
At least two cars were destroyed on the ground when the burning parts of the building fell on them.
After about two hours, according to a civil defense report, the fire managed to get under control.
The cause of its creation is not yet known.
According to witnesses, there's been a power drain in the surrounding buildings.
The extensive fire damaged Dubai's The Torch also in February 2015, destroying over a hundred apartments.
There's about 680 flats in the whole building.
Neither did anyone at the time, for the inhabitants managed to evacuate in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and then became with its 352m tallest residential building in the world.
Another Dubai skyscraper prepared his record the following year.
The culturist had 14 doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, in a sample of 30-year-old Ippolita there was a sharp collection of illicit drugs - from steroids through diuretics to drugs for Parkinson’s disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix didn't help his title, ended fourth.
Now a four-year-old distance and a criminal prosecution threatens the culturalist.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian football player David Vast was tested positive for 11 doping substances, which until then was a record number for the hit athletes.
The third player started taking steroids a year before the collapse of culture.
Lucka Vondráčková in Czech Republic.
She was hugging her ex-lover.
Barely Lucka Vondráčková entered the territory of the Czech Republic, in one round.
It also draws attention to wherever it comes.
The last time she fell into her arms was her former lover, Michal Long, with whom she lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years older and longed for the family.
Lucia was only 19 years old at the time, and she certainly didn't want to hang her career on a nail.
So they went away, but they stayed friends to this day.
Which they also proved at the TV Prima press conference, where they met for a long time.
By chance, they've both gone blue.
They didn't notice each other at first, but then they got close, and Lucie laughed at Michal's jokes when she fell behind her stomach.
Then they hugged themselves, and the photographers were willingly posed.
But their meeting was not a coincidence, for they will play together a lover couple in the new Prima series, Captain Exner.
The Islamists were given life in Britain for the preparation of the assassination.
On Thursday, the British court sent four members of the Islamist cell for life, who called themselves the Three Musketeers, and according to the prosecution planned a terrorist attack against the police and the army.
Four men, two of whom participated in a training camp in Pakistan and were previously convicted of similar acts, were arrested last August.
At the time, the authorities thought they were about to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially finished tube bomb, knives with inscriptions that in Arabic refer to "unbelievable" and maketa gun.
That's what happened when MI5's secret service agent put a listening device in the car.
"The recent assassinations showed what horror the defendants could cause if they were not stopped," said Sue Hemming, the prosecutor's representative.
Three convictions at the age of 28, 25, and 33 may apply for release after twenty years.
A fourth convict, 38 years old, can do so after 15 years in prison.
During the trial in London, men claimed to be innocent and that the weapons found in the car were placed there by an MI5 agent.
The court also heard him, but then rejected the defendants.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
They measured 38,3 °C in Hodoninsk.
On Tuesday's temperature record 37.3 degrees Celsius remained on top for only two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsia, which was recorded at the Watchtower in Hodonínsk, he was beaten Thursday, which has become the hottest day of this year.
The workers of the Czech Institute of Hydrometeorology confirmed this.
Tuesday, but Thursday, there were no many temperature records.
On Tuesday, records of 35 of 145 meteorological stations over 30 years of age were overcome or balanced.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record record temperatures.
For example, at The Watchtower, the quarterly temperature was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In Lednica in Břeclavsk, the fourth quarter of 37,4 degrees surpassed the original maximum by four tenths of the degree and in Pohorice in Brno the current 37,1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records as well as the 2013 Watchtower record.
There were ten degrees less in the west.
High temperatures appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia on Thursday.
After the Watchtower was the biggest heat in Dyjakovice in Znojamsk and Broda nad Dyja in Břeclavsk, where the mercury rose to 37.8 degrees, but the record failed.
On the contrary, for example, in the western and north-west Czech Republic, the fourth highest temperature was only about 22 degrees Celsius, according to the ČHMU website.
"The heat there began to grow until this afternoon," the meteorologists reported.
Current heats in the Czech Republic will gradually fade, according to the ČHMÚ, and more heavy rain could come on Sunday.
In most Moravian places, however, high temperatures remain on Fridays and on the south-east of Moravia on Saturdays as well.
China lacks tourists.
Beijing loses billions because of visa policies.
After decades, China has been trying to apply its influence without using force.
They spend ten billion dollars a year to support language schools and to build universities abroad, push their entertainment industry on foreign markets, and try to attract Western tourists.
That's not going to work for Beijing.
The state media there is talking about the plan to make tourism a driving force of economic change and modernisation.
The number of arrivals, however, increased by only 3.8 percent last year and about 80 percent of the tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
This is done, among other things, by the fact that despite all its global aspirations, China welcomes foreigners with an open arms, evaluating the situation in the most populous country of the world Professor of Economics at Christopher Balding University Beijing in an article for Bloomberg.
A Chinese visa policy is an example that speaks for everything.
Only 13 countries have visa-free contacts with China, citizens of the other countries have to take the visa ahead.
At the Chinese authorities in the USA, therefore, crowds are comparable to the celebrations of the Chinese New Year.
The visa costs $140, but if a person doesn't want to wait long hours in line, he has to pay $100 and more for extra services.
Such restrictions create significant economic obstacles.
The Journal of Economics and Finance study has shown that the need for a visa reduces the number of visitors by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China’s gross domestic product and lives there at less than one percent of the population, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens this problem itself when tourism uses its political objectives, such as in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China restricted its transport to South Korea in the context of a crackdown around the South Korean missile system in the spring, South Koreans repaid it and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan grew by 85 percent.
This all affects macroeconomic stability.
According to recently published reports by the U.S. Central Bank of the Fed, China was able to leave up to $190 billion as a result of Chinese foreign travel, while China receives about $35 billion a year in currency sales to incoming tourists.
According to official balance of payments figures, then, last year China had a $217 billion deficit in tourism, equivalent to 44 percent of the Chinese surplus in the merchandise trade.
A small number of tourists, therefore, are hit by a very painful blow by a country that is anxiously preventing the outflow of capital.
However, the above factors are only one manifestation of more general restraint against foreigners.
In many places in China, virtually no one has heard of immigrants.
In 2013, there were fewer than a million foreigners living in the whole of China.
There are more of them in the United States and some individual cities.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroads of immigration, has a double.
A number of scientific work shows that immigrants usually revive economic growth, business and innovation.
In China, however, you are practically not going to find them.
Solving these problems will be politically difficult, but the step that is being offered is simplifying the visa apparatus.
Other Asian countries, particularly India and Vietnam, have recently made great efforts to simplify and slow visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Pilsen Zoo, deadly toxic reptiles were multiplied.
The Pilsen Kingdom I am riding can enjoy the youth of three rare, deadly venomous reptiles.
In the exhibition visitors will only see all nine freshly born Turks disappear.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2,000 metres above sea level.
"The lengths of meters also grow," described the speaker zoo Martin Vobruba.
Young men of the other two species, mortals, and cobras of the red, yet they will gain strength in the breeding grounds of the garden.
We can't tell when people will see them yet.
"We wouldn't like to lose them," said nurse Miroslav reached out with the fact that it could take a year or two.
The Australian mortals of snakes have come into the world of eight, they are descendants of breeding couples from the population around Sydney.
"The only person that visitors can see in the exhibition belongs to mortals from around Perth," Vobruba said, with the fact that in human care it is necessary for mortals to winter 6-8 weeks at 13 degrees Celsius.
A 100% success was accompanied by a snow of African spitting cobras red.
A couple at the Pilsen Zoo hatched out of four eggs by four cubs.
"Incubation lasted 65 days," said Vobrub.
This species in the nature of its victim is spraying poison within a distance of up to four meters.
Pointing to the eyes, it can cause permanent blindness.
The babies of all three species feed in the zoo with mice shavings.
Within 40 days in the garden they still expect to get the kids out of the dream mamba black, eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to an unconfirmed transcript of a phone conversation, Trump creates pressure on Mexico to pay for a border wall.
The American daily Washington Post published a transcript of President Trump's phone calls with representatives of Mexico and Australia.
In a telephone interview on January 27th with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nietem, Trump ordered him to stop publicly declaring that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The American president reckoned to him that he was publicly condemning the construction of the wall, allegedly saying, "You can't talk like that in the press."
As part of his campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the southern borders and declared that he would pay for it.
His first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also leaked to the public, revealing an intense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the US-run agreement on refugees headed to Australia is "smart" and "stupid" and insists that if he agreed to such an agreement - which came under President Obama's rule - he would look like a "drug" after he proposed a ban on the entry of refugees into the US.
Trump terminated the call after he explained to Turnbull that "this is my most unpleasant call of the day".
Tusk spoke again to the D.A. for Smolensk.
"He has something to worry about," said the brother of the dead president, Prime Minister of Law and Justice PIS Jaroslaw Kaczyński, speaking on Tusk's address.
"I have nothing to worry about, Kaczyński will not intimidate me," Tusk said and calculated to the current leadership of the country that he is trying to use justice against political opponents.
On his departure from the seat of the prosecutor's office, he waited for Tusk according to TVN 24 dav, who had scanned Donald Tusk! and wished the politician a hundred years!!
Tusk thanked me for his support and assured him that he had a clean conscience: "I have nothing to fear, and Kaczynski will not intimidate me."
According to his own words, the prosecutors do not blame anything, but he does not doubt that justice is to be used by the current Polish rulers as an instrument against rivals, oppositions or people who do not like me, and I fear that I belong to this group.
He's been interrogated for the second time.
The prime minister was interrogated at the prosecutor's office for the second time, this time the interrogation was to deal with doubts in the autopsy of the victims of the fallacy disaster.
In addition, the body was replaced by coffins.
Families were forbidden to open coffins, and there must have been some reason.
And the reason they were afraid of the scandal was because they'd burden the Polish-Russian relations.
"Keeping good relations at all costs, despite such terrible events, should make it possible for Donald Tusk to become something very important in the EU," Kaczynski said on Catholic television Trwam.
He added that any conflict with Russia would undermine Tusk's chances of obtaining the most important seat in the union, of which Poland has absolutely nothing.
Kaczynski also announced that he had warned German Chancellor Angel Merkel that Donald Tusk and he might be affected differently, but she did not take note of it.
Tusk took an eight-hour hearing at the prosecutor's office on 19 April.
He didn't speak as a suspect at the time, but as a witness.
However, many of his calls for questioning were considered part of the obvious efforts of the Polish government and the head of the PIS of Kaczynski to discredit Tusk as a political opponent by joining with various scandals.
The Prosecutor's Office is under the responsibility of the Minister of Justice, who plays the role of the Attorney General.
A call for questioning came shortly after Tusk was elected as the head of the European Council, which Kaczynski was working hard to prevent, among other things while visiting Merkel in Warsaw.
Only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová protested the EU summit against the extension of Tuskov’s mandate.
In this case, Warsaw also left the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on the barbershops.
Barma and Senegal.
Where can the Czechs vote anywhere?
In the fall of the parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote again on the composition of the House of Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.
It's coming from a decree that regulates the delivery of ballots to a foreign country.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared its update, currently in the Opening Decision.
Four years ago, MEPs abroad voted 10,000 Czech citizens.
"Since the last amendment of the decree in 2013, there have been some changes to be taken into account in these lists," the Ministry justifies its procedure.
"In some countries new representative offices have been established, some authorities have been closed or there has been a change in the level of representation," says the material.
The decree contains two annexes, the first of which include the representative offices on which paper ballots are delivered.
This group of authorities is represented by the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a press ballot.
Their list is changing by decree.
Four years ago, the Czech Republic, for example, could vote in the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today, both embassies are closed.
The Czech Republic also abolished its representation in Panama City and Japan’s Kyoto.
He won't even vote for the General Consulate in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 for the war in the east of Ukraine.
They are now on the list of the embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, the Senegalese capital of Dakar, and the Zambian Lusace.
In Asia, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation of the Consulate General in Iraqi Irbil and Čcheng-tu, the capital of the Chinese province of S'-chuan.
Voting tickets will also be available for registered voters at the Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
The Czechs in abroad had the opportunity to elect members in the election rooms at the representative offices or consulates four times so far.
Before each election, the State Election Commission shall determine by fate the region for which candidates vote abroad.
For the first time, it was in 2002, when it was decided among South Moravian candidates.
During the next two elections, the Czech Republic was elected abroad among the Southern candidates.
In 2013, the Central Bohemian Region was elected as well as this year.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
At the premiere 15 years ago, some 3,800 people came to vote, about 6700 in 2006, four years later, 8222.
Early Chamber Elections four years ago, 10,571 voters were admitted to the embassy.
Masacr on Moore's Ford: activists remembered racist lynching
In 1948, the Ford Mercury made its way around the observable people of Monroe, Georgia, and walked towards the Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before the car with four passengers of black skin and the white driver had enough to reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns had replaced his journey.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - long dragged out of a cigarette and looked at the front window of the car.
Inside, passengers trembled with fear.
"We want that n--a Roger!" the man shouted.
"Bring him to me!"
Quietly stops the roar of a young black man who is pulled out of a passenger’s seat.
Fortunately, this scene is merely a reconstruction of the events that took place on July 22.
But when one of the men crosses the “Roger’s” neck of the corner, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have regularly returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to rebuild that fateful night in 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcomová and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were killed by members of Kukluxklan.
No one's ever been convicted of murder.
"It is surprising that in all those years, the only person has not been arrested - although we are still seeing them in our community; although we know their identity," Tyrone Brooks was heard to help organize the reconstruction of the event.
"It is a stain on our history and a burden in our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman from Georgia and a lifelong fighter for civil rights.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event presents a dramatic challenge to take place. Every year, the community of Monroe reminds us that justice has not been done enough.
"We demand prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice first of all," Brooks said.
"Until then, the healing and reconciliation process cannot be initiated."
On July 27, 1946, the judge covers one of the bodies of the lynching victims at Moore's Ford.
According to the FBI reports received by NBC News, lynching was to be attended by up to 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding districts.
However, no one has yet been prosecuted.
Although suspects remain on the loose for decades, civil rights advocates claim that both reasons for lynching - politics and sex - were known to all the residents of the city.
In April 1946, on the basis of the decision of the Supreme Court, the inhabitants of the state of Georgia received for the first time the right to participate in the elections scheduled for the summer.
And it was during the summer elections that according to the FBI that the black farmer Roger Malcom had to stab the landowners of Barnett Hester's white skin during the run-in, allegedly because of his wife.
According to Brooks, Hester had a tradition of living with Malcoma's wife, Dorothy, and brought her into a different state.
According to the FBI's statement, on July 25, 1946, the then prominent landowner of the white Loy Harrison skin for Malcoma's bail of $600.
Dorothy and cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey accompanied him to the prison.
Upon returning from the prison, just before entering the Moore's Ford bridge, a group of suspects took the route.
"As it turned out, the murders were planned and organised by Harrison," the FBI led.
"It is also clear that there has been a secret agreement between state and local law enforcement officers who not only participated in lynching but have also gotten rid of the evidence and have concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks spoke more briefly about the whole issue.
"It was a massacre for election law," he said.
"The murders had a clear subtext for all the locals of black skin: 'this is what you get if you register and go vote'."
The annual reconstruction of the event at Moore's Ford Bridge organizes almost ten years of Cassandra Greene.
It shows a deeply rooted racism, which many would like to see as extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction isn't easy and it's even more difficult to reverse the sight, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about lynching, because in doing so we have to face the unpleasant feelings hiding in each of us," Greene said.
"But there can be no relationship between us unless you hear what I had to go through."
The main tests of this year's reconstruction began in June and on the first day around 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest of blacks - enrolled in the room where Greene met them with a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is in the position of assistant director.
For many years he played the leader of Kukluxklan, but according to his words, the role is exhausting.
"I have a bad feeling about this because it contradicts who I am," Marbaugh said.
"I think it is very important to remember this part of history regularly, because we never want to go back to that time."
Herci Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascono, who are playing Roger Malcom, like Barnett Hester, are practicing their roles.
The show starts with a fight - Malcom has an argument with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get off my property, n--e!"
Rascona's not good enough.
There's been a fight.
At that point, everyone (at least every actor in black skin) will explode in laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
"What has happened?" asks Rascono.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," Greene will be happy to say.
"I don't think white people used to say "n-r" with such tone at the time."
"Exactly," one of the actors of the black skin gushes.
"You have to put greater emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility replaces a sense of closeness.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic, just so it's done with enough four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
Rascona puts emphasis on the correct words of the N word.
Now no one laughs anymore.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Squeeze, shots... and silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of actors and sings a sad song to Billie Holiday "Strage Fruit".
With every word, there's sadness in the room.
In the background of all this, there are probably a dozen eyes staring at the sweat and tears of the eyes.
In the audience there are practically the same number of blacks and whites.
One couple traveled all the way from New York Ithaca, many watching them from a nearby area.
Each of them carries the local wet climate for almost eight hours and Brooks leads them to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until this moment, murders could be viewed with distance, but now, standing in the same place where lynching took place, the atmosphere is terrifying.
In the final words, Greene's crowd will call on the body inspection.
The kids kneel to the victims' heads, watch fake blood and motionless bodies, and whisper something in their ear.
"They're not dead," a little boy beats up.
It'll take a few minutes, and Greene will thank the audience.
The actors clean the rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw is hugging Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the Kukluxklan leader.
Nick Rascona will embrace his two herring friends and cry in their arms; they will eventually be emotionally affected.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that the role hurts you.
But you had a reason."
Later that day, the audience will meet with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple are busy talking about a performance with the black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski hardly found words that would express her feelings from today's performance.
"It is difficult to listen to those ugly words and to look at those hideous deeds... which are done by people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said to reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still an up-to-date topic," she added, "only called police fighting."
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in the courtroom, enjoying dinner and talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he's already started planning a performance for the next year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to experience - but it is also a moment to think," he said.
"If we don't learn from this who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are condemned to repeat it."
I love how to use it.
A friend of mine says the instructions for use read only a little.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It's one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
I remember with nostalgia a long time ago, where the instructions for using anything were rather a rarity duty.
So my first phonograph contained only one paper on which hieroglyphs depicting the involvement of some parts, all of them had some secret markings.
When something went wrong inside for years, I offered that paper to a shaman who wasn't afraid to unscrew his backboard.
With a smile, he told me what the paper with the labyrinth was good for.
Yes, it was a common aid in the chronic separation of toilet paper.
He found a barbed wire and allowed me to listen to expensive vinyl cakes again.
The new era has brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where the overturned grape was simply held, required about ten images.
Especially led was a sketch with a description of how to insert one part into the other.
The set was two-part and no other procedure was possible.
To give it required considerable effort with the need to break down certain plastics.
My contempt for instructions ended with my self-motion of the Seat Leon brand.
The year of production of 2003 still had a book with instructions for minor repairs, among which was an exchange of lightning bulbs.
It was simple.
A total of three steps, and the work was to be done.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual forgot to state that while the light bulb went to the right to replace really only in three steps.
One, separate the cover.
2. Screw the cracked bulb and screw the new one.
3. Remove the cover.
The light bulb on the left had a problem in the form of a battery cover.
At first, I thought that by moving the right upper limb into the car’s bowels, I would weld a spring, a screw which I would easily move away from, and then I would be guided by points 1-3 of the austerity author of the service book.
Mistake of lava.
The cover had no place, no space for even Cinderella's thin hand, let alone a obese Slezan.
I lost half an hour of my life, completely without any success.
The condition was still strengthened by my wife's entry into the garage, which he summoned a lynx and words which from my mouth he heard quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked rudely.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I skip the vulgar deadlines, only two publishing words remain.
I'm changing the light bulb.
"And why is it taking so long?" she ventured, which in a long-term relationship could be her last.
I slowly explained the problem to her, with the emphasis on the author's torture of the manual, where the blessing of the burning iron on her hand, which she wrote, followed by her escape so that I could never write anything again, was merely an introduction to the wide range of formulas of Kladiv on the witch, including his commission burn on top of the Los Angeles Castle.
"How about to unscrew the box?" said the woman removing the battery.
In total despair this happened and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as the right side.
I thought I couldn't be surprised.
And that's until the day that a colleague called me, who was just discussing himself from a collapse situation after checking two State Department officials for drug control.
I know him as a co-worker who has experienced the impossible and impossible in the field and who can interpret wild stories with an unbiased voice.
"Think I've been punished for not having a penetrating manual on hand washing," he told me with a weak voice.
Gradually, I brushed out the whole problem, which was that there was no manual to wash my hands over the sink in the patient's toilet.
His argument to the committee officer that adults can generally wash their hands and that there is no need for pictograms to cope with the normal activities of decent people, has no healing effect, and has cost him little money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that a simple flushing of water-moving palms is a primitive action at the level of the cromonic, that a modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, conducts this ceremony in ten steps.
It should be reported, therefore, that it is necessary to leave the tap water.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end of the day, it is a joy to find that a man washed his hands just as his master in the SÚKL.
Finally, I must note that I have been inspired to prepare a detailed plan for the activities of the toilet.
In the question of defecation, the procedure is uniform, where the problem does not arise, in urination, given some difference between the two sexes, it will be necessary to hang the instructions two.
The problem remains the pictograms, as creating a perfect process means a precise outline of all the anatomical details, which could lead to a certain upheaval of the toilet visitor, despite the fact that he can finally learn that he has wiped the hole in his life with a completely misstep.
Pearson will release another 3,000 employees and reduce dividends in an effort to revive trade
On Friday, the British Pearson Education Group stated that it would release another 3,000 employees and reduce the interim dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring programme in order to change the business model.
Another emptiness, which, according to the Executive Director of John Fallon, will occur at the end of 2018 and from the beginning of 2019, follows the previous decision of the company to release 4000 employees under previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a cost-reduction plan of another 300 million pounds ($394 million) in May under the third programme, aimed at raising the declining trade as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its share in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann, stated that the outlook for this year remained unchanged after reporting a one-percent increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
An attack on a convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers were killed in a suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital city of Afghanistan, Kabul.
Five soldiers and interpreters were injured, as expressed by NATO.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians died in the Qarabagh city district as well.
This month, Afghanistan was hit by a bomb attack - more than 30 people were killed on Tuesday in an explosion in the Hebrew mosque.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO stated in its statement that Tuesday's explosion occurred after the patrol, together with members of the Afghan army, was attacked by “a local person with a submerged explosive device”.
The statement further states that all wounded soldiers are outside the threat of life and are located at the US military hospital at the Bagram Air Force Base.
According to the rapporteurs, the growing power of the Taliban and the groups known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh area is an important source of concern for NATO's Allied Forces in the nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% of the victims died in the capital.
At the end of July, a bomb placed in a car was killed by at least 30 people in the Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban has signed up for the attack.
On May 31st, he killed a large explosion in the city centre of more than 150 people. This is the most deadly military attack in the country since the US forces overthrown the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence has already undermined the questionable situation in Afghanistan, and President Donald Trump of the United States is considering increasing the number of U.S. soldiers to assist the military and police forces in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, the suicide attacks that he had trained in recent weeks by public confidence in the government, its regulation and particularly in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanín have shook hands.
In response to the action, EPA re-evaluated its decision to remote smoking rules
The US Environmental Protection Agency withdrew its decision to postpone the Obama Administration Act, which ordered states to reduce emissions only the day after the Agency had applied for 15 states.
In the middle of the night, EPA announced its decision on the transfer of the "Oson Standards 2015" by saying that it is committing the Agency to cooperate with the States.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and we will hear their views," said EPA Director Scott Pruitt in his statement.
Pruitt announced in June the efforts of the EPA to remove ozone standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and determine, on the basis of measurement, the limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen of the majority of the democratic states, together with Washington, D.C., filed an action Tuesday arguing that EPA's action was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administrator seeks to avoid the many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - according to Trump's words, in an effort to kick economic growth.
However, the new government has launched counter-measures by Democrats and Conservative Groups, which fear the impact of emissions on public health.
EPA states on its website that air breathing with ozone content “can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms” such as asthma.
The singer Ladislav Bubnar got shot and blood flowed!
This, with us a relatively new singer, you may have already registered in June this year, when this almost unknown singer in our country has organized a monstrosity event hosted by such leading personalities as Master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and a number of others, and the event has not been staged by anyone other than Leoš Mares.
The purpose was simple, to show itself to the public and to present their music video of Sarah’s song, whose baptism was attended by the newly appointed personalities.
Few know, however, that the recording of the video that was taking place in Russia did not go without problems, and singer Ladislav Bubnar himself had to be treated.
It was his first big film with the stars of the Russian national ballet and it didn't work out without a lot of trouble.
Sara's song is very emotional and is based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the dramaticity of the scene, in a video of singers' juice, he had to indicate a punch slap.
At one point, however, he was hit so strongly and directly into the nose that a young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was this morning, I didn't expect it, it immediately came down from my nose," said Ladislav of the situation.
Colleagues and producers told themselves that it was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav failed to react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not so serious that it affected the continuation of the next shooting.
The video of a young artist we are bringing to you now, you can also record the scene with the impact.
An unprovoked version of blood, however, was not preferred.
Mikey Garcia and Vasil Lomachenko talked at a meeting about possibilities for mutual duel
Vasil Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most exciting boxing match in the light weight, met for the first time on Tuesday.
Each of them was located in a separate room in the ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia - an undefeated champion in the light scales of the World Boxing Council - had not gone down to the hall where Lomachenko welcomed the champion in the World Boxing Organization.
After Garcia's victory on the basis of a unanimous decision against the former four-time world champion Adrian Broner in the Saturday match at Showtime, both boxers got on the list of five best boxers in the light weight.
Garcia pulled on his right hand and said: “How's it going, champ?
Good luck."
Lomachenko defends the title against Miguel Marriaga at the ESPN on Saturday at 7:00 p.m.
Boxers pose for photographers and manager Lomachenko Egis Klimas adds that the potential boxing match would be a "perfect test".
"I'm a former champion in pen weight," says Garcia.
“For the fight with Broner (67 kg) I had to gain weight, but I am not that big.
I'm 63 pounds short.
I'd like to go back to the light weight category.
He's got to put the crowbar back together to get a little bit of weight... then we can run away.
That's what fans want.
Why don't they do it."
The breaker agrees.
"The box would benefit from this fight."
Klimas raised a request for payment for consideration - which is part of his strategy. Lomachenko should graduate his debut in the light weight at the end of this year and next year he will face Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in the match against the winner of the duel Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who meet on 23 September about a title in the light weight in the Forum arena.
"The match should take place in the style of the pay for the viewing, it is requested by fans," said Garcia, who later said that the possibility of sending a match through a television station that comes with the best offer is open.
"We are the main attractions.
No one else gets that kind of attention.
"We'll wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said he recognized Lomachenko as a "miracle boxer" and could participate in his Saturday match.
But the breaker didn't give Garcia the praise when he said that the champion of the three Divisions from Riverside looked "very slow... sorry Mike, but you're thinking about knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then to the box.
Both boxers said they felt a rising tension in front of each other's duel.
"You won't forget this game.
No other match puts so much emphasis on each other.
And I will gladly put in the fire," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey."
It's gonna be a great game."
A young couple 12 years ago disappeared without a trace.
They just found their car at the bottom of Volga.
The couple of young Russians Ilja Žirnov and Kira Čerkasov have been missing since December 2005.
There was an extensive search for them, but without success.
And the police ended the investigation in the end for lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they would not know what had happened to the couple.
After 12 years, the whole story came to a sad conclusion.
The wreck of their car found a lay diver at the bottom of the Volga River in Cheboksary, in Chuvassk.
Only because of the evidence that was left in the car did the police manage to ID a few.
The evidence survived for decades under water, and without it it would take the police much longer to find out the identity of those found.
The couple was last seen when Žirnov borrowed a car from his father to pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous for the time being.
His find reported to the Cheboksar police, which the following day pulled the car to the beach.
Investigators believe that the death of a young couple was an accident caused by a grueling road leading around the river.
However, the investigation continues, further details will be published after its completion.
Latest results of tests to determine the age limit of asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of asylum seekers in Sweden who have been subjected to a new method of assessing their age show that over 80 percent of people have been questioned as being over 18 years of age, but not everyone believes in their accuracy.
The Swedish Forenz Medical Agency (Rêttsmedicinalverket) started new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is to assess more accurately applicants in the context of the evaluation of asylum applications. The measures were taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failure to determine the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6880 cases for examination and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests conducted from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 per cent (2002) was assessed as 18 years of age, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency considered that the question was “possibly older than 18 years of age”.
In another 423 cases, it was decided that the question could be asked ‘less than 18 years of age’.
The test shall only be applied if the age of questionable is contested.
According to Johan Gösransson, the results of the forensics agency correspond to the previous month.
“In contrast to last month, statistics are held in busy tracks and numbers are very similar," he said for The Local.
A higher number of applicants whose age is estimated at 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases it was found that “the person questioned is 18 years or older”.
News from Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the investigator stated that he would be 18 years old this year.
Critics were also faced with a medical age-setting method that includes X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI knee joint scans, which are subsequently assessed by dentists and X-rays.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, which examines, among other things, the biological maturity of people to determine the age of puberty.
"I had reason to think about this issue, and I do not think that these types of measurements to assess age are right.
Assessment of biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we can't determine age with accuracy, we shouldn't pretend the opposite," he said for Metro.
The forensic medical agency Agency's Gásransson defended the decision by saying: “In general it can be said that the risk of misevaluation of a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the person questioned is just below the limit of 18 years, which in this case corresponds to 10 per cent of all the persons questioned."
Trump threatened President Mexico on the phone.
US President Donald Trump threatened to meet him if he publicly said that his country would not pay for building a wall between the US and Mexico.
Trump in the interview said that funding would be arranged, even though he admitted that it would have to be provided from other sources.
Similarly, Trump spoke openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This stems from transcripts of interviews published by the American daily The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made building a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his last year's election campaign.
Right in the first interview with the Mexican president shortly after he joined Trump Phenya Nieta in a non-diplomatic discipline for his critical approach to his plan to build the wall.
He described the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pushed the Mexican president to avoid publicly saying that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say this to the press," Trump repeatedly said in a January 27th interview and threatened to interrupt contact with the Mexican President if he continues to issue a defiant statement.
I hear funding's going to come up somehow, and it's going to work out fine eventually.
"But if you say that Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to see you gentlemen anymore, because it's unacceptable to me," said the American Journal of Trump.
The wall has identified the least important thing we're talking about, but politically it may be the most important thing.
An executive command to build the Trump wall was issued shortly after taking power.
Mexico is rejecting the construction and financing of a wall of 2,200 kilometres, and the relationship between the two countries is also threatened.
At the end of March, Trump said the project would be paid by the United States.
In the end, Trump met with his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the July G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28th.
Chief of the White House called it a ridiculous conversation.
To that end, he was invited to exchange views on the agreement that Australia will provide asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the admission of persons from international facilities in the Pacific Islands.
Trump first considered the deal stupid, but later he joined her.
"You can definitely say that this is not the agreement you have created, but you will have to stick to it," said Trump Turnbull.
In some passages, the telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost bubbling, for example when Trump appreciated the good idea of Australian refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
Suddenly, though, the tone of the conversation intensified.
"I hate taking these people," said Trump.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in prison now.
"They won't be great people who go to work for local dairy," he said.
In the interview, he also noted that a refugee could become an assassin from Boston in five years.
Trump led at the end of January, about a week after his arrival in the White House, telephone conversations with a number of world statesmen, often several during one day.
He ended up calling Turnbull the least pleasant one in the whole day.
Before ending it, he had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
They repaired Rana's killer before the crowd.
Her father was watching, too.
The execution took place on the square in the capital city of Yemen Saná.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose Rana Almatari, a little girl who lived in his neighborhood as his victim.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped a girl, took her father to his house, where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
Then he raped her body, which then he threw near the mosque.
A small girl's violent death hit the entire country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the first row of the thousand-headed crowd to witness the execution.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi was sentenced to Shariah's right.
After the execution, the victim's father shared his feelings with the media.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's the new day of my life.
The other members of the family were present, along with the crowd shouting the slogan "Let Justice Live".
A rapist in the square brought in a police van from which he was dragged.
The cops put him on his stomach tied up.
One of the members turned his weapon against him and fired the fire from the immediate vicinity.
The present crowd celebrated every blow that was burned.
Mr. Almatari told MailOnline that justice was done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia's justice have won," he added.
I was standing at the Free House in Sana awaiting the execution of my daughter's killer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Rana's tiny body and buried him in a nearby cemetery.
My wife and I are grateful that justice has been done.
The police were afraid that the crowd gathered in the square would fall apart into hateful madness, the killer would fall in and gurgle.
The execution was ordered by the court, which is under the administration of the Shia Hutti.
Originally, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 whips after the arrest, but his act aroused such an upheaval that the judge had decided to punish death.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on June 27.
The wounded family knew him well.
When the police searched his house, they found evidence that the man was planning his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could have been his motive?
Even the animal would have been more merciful to the wound.
"Our family has no enemies and the injuries that wounded the body were terrifying," the media said.
"The morning went away in the afternoon, the day we reported it to the police, we told the newspapers and all our television stations, posters with her photo were hanging everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the killer's parents who suspected their son of a horrible crime.
The girl's mother, Jamilyh, had to be hospitalized after she learned that her daughter's body had been found.
She used to go out with the other kids from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We've been looking everywhere, but Rana's gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we looked for nothing.
The inhabitants of Yemen were disgusted with the crime and began to gather in front of the police station, where al-Maghrabi was held, and to demand immediate punishment.
The Deputy Justice Department read to the present crowd an investigation to calm them down.
The accused apparently did not feel sorry for his actions.
Just before the execution of the sentence, the police read to him the verdict, but the man who was convicted was only looking at his executioner.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but on the internet, there were many records that the crowd ordered.
Governor of West Virginia announced a change of political party
Democratic Governor of West Virginia Jim Justice announced on Thursday night that he was moving to another party at President Trump's meeting.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," said Governor Justice.
"Today, after a long prayer and meditation, I am informing you... today, as a resident of West Virginia, that I cannot continue to support you from the position of democratic governor."
The crowd of spectators burst out with joy.
"I will join the republicans tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another game."
Trump had previously promised important announcements to the people at a meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won the West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes magazine is the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited great wealth from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, on Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying: “The passing of Governor Justice is another morning for a democratic party that puts obstacles in our way instead of bringing our country up.”
"For a democratic party with only 15 governors and at least legislative authorities in history, the announcement by Governor Justice is the last drop for an already spoiled party without a leader who vainly seeks to find positive and unifying reports," said RNC President Ronna McDaniel in her statement to the CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's "true" apology for the doping scandal
The former excellent sportsman Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for its sincere apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that the right time had not yet come for Russia to return to the sport world.
Chief of Russian athletics Dmitry Sylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which took place in the eve of the MS in the athletics - that the expulsion of his country from the sport world was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all the athletes who thus lost the gold and silver medals.”
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF voted in favour of maintaining the ban, which entered into force in November 2015 after the report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) revealed that Russia was supporting the doping of its athletes.
"I think today we have seen very sincere answers and presentations," President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
"All members of the Council and Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia has admitted its error and is working from all levels to repair and restore the proper function of the entire Federation."
Coe said he was also “welcomed” that Russia had adopted criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today has been very successful and we have gone to the next stage, but Congress supports the recommendation of the Crisis Staff to maintain the punishment that has been imposed on Russia," Coe added.
"In the coming months we must do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
Our efforts have always been to separate honest athletes from the dishonest ones," he ended his speech.
On the MS at the atlet, which starts on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes will compete under the neutral flag to comply with strict IAAF rules.
Chief of the IAAF Rune Andersen Crisis Headquarters said on Monday that Russia still has to meet several criteria before being allowed back.
The drug tests are still unsatisfactory and the coaches' exclusion continues to operate, he told reporters in London after the IAAF Council presentation ended.
The CzechTrade State contract was awarded to František Savo, whose state is under prosecution.
The CzechTrade State Export Agency's public contract was awarded to the Young Front František Savo.
Officials gave him 100 percent of points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind, however, that the Czech State is prosecuting Savova for tax fraud and requesting his extradition to the Czech Republic.
In April, the CzechTrade Ministry of Industry and Trade Export Agency issued a public contract for four years providing editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
A total contract of 30.8 million crowns was awarded to the publishers The young front of the entrepreneur Františka Savova.
The Czech police have already accused him of tax evasion in 2014 and are pursuing him on the run.
Savov fled to Great Britain and the Czech Republic requesting his release.
He alerted the server at the latest.cz.
According to the original criteria, CzechTrade had to decide on the award of the contract with 60 per cent of the price offered and the remaining 40 beauty contests, i.e. the quality of the project.
That was why it greatly helped Savov’s company in the second criterion.
According to Dotik.cz received 100 points in all partial quality criteria.
This was the result of which she was moved before another candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, who offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with an amount of 404,900 crowns a month, VLM offered 324,350 crowns.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it has obtained a total of 62 points from the assessors in all qualitative criteria under the sub-average evaluation.
Tendru was further involved in the consulting company BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which falls under the same name as the server Current.cz under the publication Economia.
The VLM published several objections against the tender's result, with its evaluation considered to be unfair and insufficiently justified.
Following their refusal, they decided to contest the competition with the OOHS Competition Office.
He believes that the CzechTrade was in conflict with the law.
"The applicant is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of the contracting authority on the basis of a series of subjective evaluation, clearly favouring the participant Mladná fronta, a.s., at the expense of the applicant and other suppliers," the server said in a proposal to launch the proceeding submitted to OSHS this week, which was published by the server.
According to the Director-General and Chairman of the Board of Directors, VLM Michal Klíma appears to be a credible and high-value evaluation of the Young Front project by all its members as a particularly suspicious one.
"Every independent observer must consider such a miraculous success by one of the competitors unlikely and suspicious," he said for Current Klima.
The CzechTrade has not yet spoken to the situation.
The CzechTrade Agency does not comment substantially on public contracts prior to their conclusion.
All information about you mentioned is published in the Contractor's Profile and Public Contracts Journal in accordance with the law.
"After the contract has been completed, a full written report will be published; however, during the course of the contract, we cannot comment on its progress," said Štěpán Długý, Media Representative of the Agency.
The young front reacted by saying that it considered it to be extremely problematic that the publication Economia had hit an article in Aktualno.cz into a competition where it had its own business interests.
However, that fact was stated in that Article.
In the tender, she could have been helped by the fact that she was the one who provided the BusinessInfo Editorial Service in the previous four years.
The contract was first awarded in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade led Martim Cuba ODS.
František Savova blames the police for tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions to its companies, which caused alleged damage to the Czech state up to 770 million crowns.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK to issue it since 2014.
According to Savo, he is responsible for his criminalization chief of the ANO Andrej Babiš movement, whose influence falls under the Mafra publishing industry.
The London Court rejected the appeal against the extradition last year, but the entrepreneur appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, from Great Britain, in the matter of obtaining legal power to date, we have not received any understanding," said Štěpánek Zenklov, spokesman for the Prague municipal government.
In addition to the ownership of the Young Front, Savov was located in the Harvard Limited company based in Cyprus, which controlled the českobujovice brewery Samson, and in the Cyprus company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund, purchasing threatened assets.
He should be in control of Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes more than three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov has also been associated with the deposing of assets from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The biker rode through the hallways and the park, ended up in the boilers.
The biker drew attention to himself by driving recklessly on the streets, pedestrians and park roads in Ušovice.
When the patrol followed him, he decided to run her in the direction of the Station.
"Policemen with increased caution followed the city when Daniel Dvořák, a police spokesman, failed to drive the Marian Spas, and took the motorcycle to the field where he crashed," said Daniel Dvořák, a police spokesman.
In the end, a rescue helicopter had to arrive, transporting the injured motorbike to a crawling hospital.
The officers then found out that the biker did not own the driver's license, the license plate on the motorcycle was cut off, its production number scraped and the production label itself removed.
It's so possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is the subject of further investigation.
"The breath test carried out was excluded from the presence of alcohol on the driver, but a positive result was found on the substance methamphetamine," the police spokesman added.
How the financial rules of football affect the move of Neymara to Paris
The rules restricting the financing of European football clubs do not violate Neymar's record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any Penalisation for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by the EUFA, which supervises European football teams and has the power to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious League of Masters.
The financial fair play (FFP) rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 provide that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transition has not been financed without significant losses.
Barcelona paid an over €22 million to buy Neymara out of his contract, and Neymar will demand a salary of over tens of millions a year.
Following several financial conditions, Neymar's transfer to France.
Since the PSG team is funded by a rich Qatari family that has been rich in energy sales, it can afford to bring Neymara to an already star football family.
Clubs can spend huge amounts on the purchase of players, but on the other hand they have to prove the legal sources of income, which allows them to cover the management costs of business activities related to football.
FFP introduced Michel Platini after joining the seat of Director UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that the clubs that would be in debt in pursuit of new reinforcements ultimately cheat and risk bankruptcy if banks or owners refused to provide them.
In 2011, the FFP shifted its attention from club debt to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich used with Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and spend the pride sums on players y to build a global brand - suddenly not so convenient.
In the current three-year trial period ending in 2018, clubs may show losses up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platinum had to leave his post in 2015, his successor Alexander Ceferin is determined to defend the ban on excessive spending.
"The FFP rules are still valid and we are determined to strengthen them in the future," he said last week for Associated Press Andrea Traverso, who is overseeing compliance with the FFP rules.
Although the PSG paid the amount for the purchase of Neymara on a one-off basis, for accounting purposes the amount may be spread over the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be broken down to EUR 44.4 million annually for five years.
The first FFP wave of the highest sanctions hit PSG in 2014 along with Manchester City, which owns Abu Dhabi.
PSG took a fine of EUR 60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and a command to reduce the team of the League of Champions to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA pays attention to teams that can attempt to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their income through companies associated with club owners.
Thus, while the Qatari company is sponsoring PSG once funding exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the calculation of the amount.
A similar measure was taken by UEFA in 2014 after deciding that the amount of funding provided by Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
Some reports suggest that part of Neymar's revenue in PSG could be paid from the MS's Organising Commission in Football 2022 in Qatar.
However, the PSG and the representatives of MS 2022 in Qatar denied that Neymat should become an ambassador of MS in football and that such a manoeuvre would easily be revealed by UEFY officials.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to the UEFA dedicated personnel on Tuesday, there has been no investigation into the matter of the transition of Neymara to PSG.
The source of this report wished to remain anonymous as it was not justified to comment on the situation with PSG, said The Associated Press.
The latest published accounts show that PSG closed the year 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymara's arrival to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and selling jerseys.
The club promises to increase turnover by up to 30 percent from the signing of the contract.
The representatives of the Spanish League, apparently concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to fade Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG would violate the FFP rules.
“This is a clear case of ‘financial doping’ to the club and the state,” said President La League Javier Teba for the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of the PSG club by the Qatari syndicate.
The manager of Arsenal Arsene Wenger, whose club owns an American sports magnate, shares the same La League attitude about financing the club.
"It is the consequence of ownership that has changed the football world from scratch in the last 15 years," Wenger was heard on Thursday.
"If he becomes the owner of the club, everything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult because the state may have different interests in the participation of such players in its club."
Spartan publisher Russian: Change is painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand cheering fans on their feet.
Tomáš Rosicki is going to the plaza.
Same scene as Sunday's game against the Bohemians.
The Spartan backer moved against the Red Star game, invented several goals, but his fellow players did not aim black.
The flight team pumped with new multimillion-strong reinforcements thus ends after the initial double match in European cups.
Was there anything else difficult to do with the fight after the Brethren of Belgrade?
After the scored goal, four shots had to be fired, which was hard for us.
At least we didn't want to lose, to raise our self-confidence so that we could get away from other games.
We had a chance.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why couldn't Sparta get into the game that long?
The game's super worked out.
The combination of the opponent was much better than ours.
We didn't get to anything, but in half an hour, we fired once.
That is, of course, very little when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, we were able to play with them in the final third.
But you have to push your opponent more often into positions like this.
Is the large number of changes in the composition a problem?
Of course, it's one of the pains of forming a new man.
We've only played three competitions and the composition is still changing.
It's just that the coach finds the perfect eleven sitting down.
Is it encouraging for you that you've already played part of two games together?
They're still just part of the game.
I don't know how my condition will develop and when I can finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that took place in Sparta?
We have to be, or we can't be.
It's the same as the injury.
If you don't believe, you can't come back.
Sparta has made some decision, we must be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
Fans came back in great numbers, but they left in despair.
What can you tell them?
There was a wonderful visit again, just like with the Goddess.
I'm so sorry we can't make them feel better.
To show you something they'll come for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember such visits when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without cups at least be a benefit to the league?
So far, we're fighting ourselves, we're playing together, so it's not such an advantage for us.
For an extreme tax evasion, the entrepreneur is to be held for ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of the entrepreneur Jiří Toman, who is expected to spend a considerable amount of ten years in prison for tax cuts.
The calculated damage is 645 million crowns.
Toman complained that justice violated his fundamental rights, the effective findings of the Zlín and Olomouc courts were said to be incomplete.
The Constitutional Court, however, ruled the complaint unfounded, found the Czech Republic from the court's database.
The UC is not another appeal court.
"He cannot, as a fourth instance, judge the factual or legal doubts allegedly committed by the General Courts if they do not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution states.
Toman was convicted as a fugitive.
The verdict has been valid since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouc.
At that time, Toman was in publishing custody in Argentina, where according to the resolution he was also at the time of decision-making.
The penalties imposed are at the upper limit of the statutory rate, which, according to the verdict, corresponds to the damage caused.
The Supreme Court found the case to be an extreme tax evasion, which has a macro-economic impact on the state budget.
The man served from 2005 to 2008 as Chairman of the World Service Board.
The damage of 645 million crowns was created only during the period January to July 2008 and the overall escape was known to exceed a billion.
However, for procedural reasons it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the full amount.
According to the prosecution, World Servis did not include all the invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise taxes in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns, tax was paid in just thousands of months.
World Servis and some of the companies with which the company dealt have relations with the entrepreneur Radomír Vyberal, whose justice has measured for VAT manipulation in fuel trades 13 years in prison.
His complaint was also rejected before the time of the Constitutional Court.
The series “Friendly Years” and “Comrade Detective” play on the nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both the characters of the famous 1980s; for the dirty 90s (when genius David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced on MTV a comedy sketch “The State”); and of course for the modern time, especially in 2001, before stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehlerová and Paul Rudd started bigger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and at the same time the embodying of our modern facebook era of lasting memories.
From a French point of view, it looks like someone's breathing.
The series “First Day of Camp” worked surprisingly well - not only because of absurd humor (an example can be the story of the formation of a talking can with the vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors turned away from the main funny points - middle-aged actors who played teenage horny children - and they could not have been so drawn from previous events.
The continuation of the “Ten Years Later” in which adults do not press so much on the emotional plane and satire is a place to be sporadic, including a parody on the thrillers of the 1990s as “hand on the cradle”.
At one point, the figure will be found at the Apple Powerbook haraving heap, roller skates and “a lot of other things from 1991”.
Many major story lines are repeated.
Goodhearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now writer, has still not moved through his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr Showalter), inspired by George H. W. Bush (very well-occupied Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the French is many side stories.
It is especially fun to watch an eternal young Rudd with long hair alias by Matt Dillon from the film Young, whose once respected figure Andy is now behind the old paprika.
Francesz could start off moments of random madness, such as returning to the series "Seven Up", until it reaches what I assume will be logical reasoning: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when in the last scene the whole group will be released on the premiere "Flights for survival".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to another type of nostalgia: Revivalism of the Cold War of the series "Such Normal Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde: No Regrets" and even the series "GLOW" in which the icons of the eastern and western wrestling scenes collide.
The comedy of creators Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanaka directed by Rhys Thomase is designed to act as a television show: a drama of two Bucharest policemen from Romania in the 1980s who struggle for the truth and atheism in the way Marxism-lenim.
The main role - toughening Gregor and idealist Iosef - is played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Streets, who have acquired into English Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more.
Some jokes make you laugh (such as cops watching chess on TV - parody on American football).
The show was rented by many famous actors - Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny.
"Comrade Detective" is, however, too focused on the impeccable propaganda drama - which includes the killer with Reagan's mask - and it also seems so.
Six long episodes are too exciting and comedy moments are not enough.
In a shorter track, the propaganda satire in the "Comrade Detective" could work, such as in a scene where Gregor and Ioef are repeatedly attending the US Embassy, in which two fats are looking at hamburgers assembled in a large pile.
A clear message for an imaginary Communist audience is the fact that Western culture can transform everything into food and orgy.
The idea of the Romanian creators was not wrong: we do so with our own culture as well as with theirs.
Russian athletes have not been expected to lift the ban on launches from the IAAF.
The International Athletic Federation of IAAF at London Congress confirmed the extension of the international ban on the start of Russian racers due to the state-supported doping programme.
The voting in the history of the world championship, which begins on Friday, has come to a very clear conclusion.
To extend the ban, 166 delegates spoke against only 21 votes.
The main reason for the rejection is the fact that Russia fails to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as stated before the congress by the head of the special investigation group IAAF Rune Andersen.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some of the older doping cases remain unresolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been questioned, and coaches are still working in the country with a stunned reputation.
The Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-doping Agency, is not fully operational until now.
However, RUSADA can carry out testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"Although progress has been made, much work still needs to be done," said President Sebastian Coe of the IAF.
The Russian athletic federation was suspended in November 2015, so Russian athletes lost, among other things, the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro last year.
Despite the ban on the coming MS, there will be 19 Russians who have previously proven that they have been tested for longer periods outside the Russian anti-doping system.
But at the championship they won't be able to start in national colors and they won't play a Russian anthem if they win.
The Bank of England will maintain an interest rate of 0.25 %
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following a lack of economic growth and a fall in inflation, which has led to speculation about sharp growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain "in the background" in the context of maintaining the interest rate - despite defamation of family budgets.
The monetary policy board (MPC) of the Bank of England voted six out of two to maintain the interest rate at 0.25 %. The results of the vote on the increase in the interest rate supported a marginal economic growth supported by a weak increase.
In its annual report on inflation, the Bank predicted growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the reduction in family budgets would continue.The Bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in autumn.
At the same time, the Bank indicated that over the next few years there should be growth as a result of the inflation caused by Brexit and also indicated that the rent from the estate should increase more in the financial markets than expected.
The members of the Committee also voted in favour of the withdrawal of part of the mother's package, whose task was to support the economy, which was introduced into practice a year ago as a response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, the current funding plan should start as of next February, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, although the Bank of England has indicated that it will now offer £15 billion less than planned £115 billion.
Just before the decision, the bank stated: “MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will, in the short term, stagnate with the pressure on real household income and consumption burden.”
On the subject of the rates, the bank stated that it would need to "take the money policy belts" to calm inflation, to a greater extent than the markets expect.
Markets are currently predicting a first increase in the third quarter of next year and another increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be “free” and “restricted”.
The Bank reduced growth forecast for this year and next year compared to 1,9 % and 1,7 % predicted in May.
The expected growth in 2018 remained unchanged at 1,8 %.
After the disclosure of estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
Libra fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and by 0.4% to € 1.11.
The decision to maintain the current state came after a disappointing increase in hopes of further growth - GDP stopped at 0.3% in the second quarter compared to 0.2% of the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain 0.3% in the third quarter, although by the end of the year the bank should slightly increase.
The latest report on inflation is a minor comfort for households affected by rising inflation and poor wage increases.
The report further states that monetary policy “can’t prevent” revenue cuts in the coming years, but is expected to rise “clearly” towards the end of a three-year forecast.
Economic growth should also be due to the great interest in British goods due to weak librarianism, which compensates for a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came a year after last August’s rates had been reduced to 0.025% in response to a shocking vote on the EU referendum, which led to a decline in the pound.
The Bank estimates that full harmonisation of prices and economies will take at least four years.
Prior to the bank's decision on the most recent rates, many demanded an increase in rates, along with rising inflation, which increased the pressure on households.
Last month's inflation declined to 2.6% from June 2.9%, even though the bank indicated that such a change was expected and that inflation should rise again over the next month.
The Bank stated that the excess relative to 2 % of the target was “fully” due to a weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “In view of the recent fall in swap rates, it seems that competition in the mortgage market will only rise once creditors compete for contracts with a view to a good view of the end of the year.
The market looks especially good for those who end existing contracts and re- hypotheses - there are no fees available in the tender, as well as low rates that they receive on their favorites."
NHS prescribes a controversial HIV medicine in 10,000 patients
Patients will receive access to “transformive treatment for HIV prevention” from September on the basis of a decision by the Supreme Court to fund NHS.
The National Health Service (NSH) reported that a pre-exposure pill prophylaxis (PreEP) used before sex, lowering the risk of infection in high-risk patients up to 86 percent, will be offered through health services to approximately 10,000 patients within a three-year trial period.
The NSH agreed to finance the trial period after the appeal court supported the Supreme Court decision of last year, stating that the NHS had the funds to repay the PrEP despite a statement that the drug should be financed by the local authorities.
The decision announced on Thursday was taken by the NHS of England from the mouth of General Director Simon Stevens as “a significant intervention”, while National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as “a decisive moment”.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start receiving patients. Other clinics will join in October and by April 2018 there will be full implementation across England.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) is a medicine used before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PreEP significantly reduces the risk of transmission of HIV among patients at risk.
Pre-sex PrEP means that there are enough specific medicines in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Tested patients include homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people and people with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
The clinics shall identify eligible participants who sign consent to the test, including men, women, transsexuals and individuals, with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with the GP in the UK can also apply to their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The program will come taxpayers to £10 million and NHS England signed this week a drug distribution contract after obtaining an international public contract.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PreEP, its purpose, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: “This important intervention should complement and make it more and more difficult to keep expanding and more successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It's another milestone in over thirty years trying to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health.'
Deborah Gold, CEO of NAT (National Aids Trust), said: “We are witnesses of a critical moment in the fight against HIV.
If PREP is administered correctly and patients at risk, it will offer the possibility of changing the English HIV epidemic.
NSH will offer from September to patients at high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and does not necessarily need to negotiate a partner, which will improve the quality of many lives.
We accept this statement with pleasure.'
Ian Green, executive director of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The number one priority must be to test quickly throughout the country; we must ensure its availability to each patient.
We now have the PrEP test medicine and we are on a good track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.'
Shadow Minister of Health Sharon Hodgson said: “The beginning of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delay and retention by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this medicine can be part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending transmission of this life threatening infection.
The following tests will bring us a step closer to the full understanding of PreEP benefits.
Now it is important that we start the tests as soon as possible throughout the country and protect people who are exposed to HIV and thus end the spread of HIV in society together.'
Life on a high leg: inter-smart and smart design turned this small apartment on Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, former banker with passion for real estate, traded a big house in Knightsbridge in 2014 for an apartment in Earls Court.
Located on the first floor of the smart terrace Queen Anne - it is an example of modern design that uses the maximum available space.
"Before that, I lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in Knightsbridge," Joanne said.
"I was looking for something at a more reasonable price.
I ran into this apartment in Earls Court and had the same height ceiling.
I fell in love with him right away, and I nodded on him the other day."
Since then, an apartment has passed by the size of 1,000 square metres of complete recyclable.
One room apartment with a complicated spread - to get into the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add the rest rooms and the interstate to use the high ceiling.
"I longed for a high ceiling, large windows and lots of light.
Those were my demands," she said.
To this end, Erfan Azadi was employed by Duck & Shed from the design and design studio based in Notting Hill and used almost a four-meter ceiling to create a home that was not just a project but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such heights that there were two gaps above each other - the challenge for architects was to create an interspatial level on which to walk up front.
Erfan must have involved his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is completely complicated," he explained.
"We had to arrange both spaces so that we could walk uprightly.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but at the same time bending the steel structure so that at the right height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement enabled Erfan to construct two fully-fledged rooms on himself - and at the same time add to the drama.
In the interstate, he looks at the beautiful living room of the old copper window frame in the retrouvius design.
Mirror furniture in gold color, silver lines and retro mirrors Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides and it looks so long.
A mirror leaf in the kitchen looks like a window in another room.
At the front door are the storage spaces provided with mirrors for storage of cutlery and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which rents an impression of a significantly larger space throughout the apartment, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen if it is not used.
The congealed kitchens are nothing new.
However, what is unique about this solution is a sliding door.
"We had to solve the technical site," Erfan says about tightened carpeted doors.
"The door is equipped with counterweights to fit very easily."
Thanks to the smart use of the space and storage space, Joanne gained an additional 16 sqm, a second room and a better overall house layout.
"When it comes to it, what you sell is a residential area - or an appreciation of your property," Erfan said.
‘The real broker will essentially calculate its price on the basis of the living area when entering the apartment.’
In this case, it was possible to increase the living space while retaining the quality materials that lend space a luxurious look.
"Material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with home," Erfan added.
“You don’t love electricity distributions in walls.
Yes, they are important, but your hearts do not gain."
As it turned out, quality design and increased living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And just like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States is dissecting itself.
The cultural and political divide between the blue and the red is deepening.
California has issued a ban on the travel of its citizens to Tennessee and the other seven states.
The State of Tennessee paid her back and declared a reprehensible ban on the travel of its citizens to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the fullest sense; the citizens of the United States can travel freely across all 50 states.
It is a ban on California from spending state money on the travel of its citizens to eight other states, including Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this madness?
California is strongly against the LGBT and any manifestation of disapproval of the LGBT lifestyle is considered discrimination.
However, Tennessee has passed a law on conscientious objection, according to which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the treatment of patients in the LGBT community is not obliged to provide it, but has a duty to provide these patients with a different therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have adopted laws under which religious charity organizations, which have taken children from mothers after birth to adoption, have no obligation to provide these children with same sex couples.
Because of these laws on the reservation of conscience, California prohibited the financing of its citizens' travel to the eight states of the Union from its resources.
In practice, it means that California professionals must not have the way to scientific symposia, for example, in Texas paid off from their universities, because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
It is absurd for the federal government to finance the travel of citizens from State A to State B, or private sponsorship.
Tennessee's state has been patient and his parliament has passed a resolution that he also dislikes California's high tax policy, high state spending, high deficits and illegal immigrants' tolerance, but yet he does not approve of a travel embargo in California for it.
He's retaliating them as a California travel embargo on Tennessee.
The same will happen to any state of the Union, which would impose a similar travel ban on another State for any reason.
At the same time, he called the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's a fact, now a comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing is anti-constitutional.
The States have the right to pass laws on conscientious objectors, as well as to decide what their money will go for and what they can't do.
Second, what's wrong with having a guilty conscience?
If a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why not offer only beef, lamb, poultry, and fish?
Why force him to sell pork under the penalty when the butchers offering pork are enough?
In Colorado, a baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a high fine because he refused to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why don't you punish him and leave him alone and order the cakes for hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the Federation are guaranteed, but individual states can regulate internal, domestic policies in powers that are not federal according to their own preferences.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California, too!
Fourthly, members of the LGBT community once rightly sought to tolerate their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of life, and let them live, which should be governed by all reasonable people, but some activists strive never to tolerate themselves or others, but for extreme intolerance to others.
According to them, no one can ever show moral, religious or philosophical opposition to the LGBT lifestyle, and if he does so, he should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They're modern enemies of freedom.
Fifthly, I don't know the situation in American history where states have done this for political reasons, except for the one thing.
Even at the time of the fight for the civil rights of black people, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of segregation, the states did not impose sanctions on themselves.
The only case was in the 1950 ’ s, the political penalty was slavery and the war of the North against the South.
Of course, nothing like this will happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political divide between the blue democratic states and the Red Republic states is deepening and the US is mentally dissipating.
Unauthorized agitation.
Critic Putin's got a grotesque ticket.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalnyj received a fine of 300,000 rubles for violating the campaign rules before the presidential elections which will take place next year.
He was fined by the court for calling on people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
Navalnyj organized two major anti-government street protests in the last two months and announced that he wanted to apply for the head of state in March next year.
Chief Executive of Kremlin Vladimir Putin has not announced his candidacy yet, but he is expected to do so and win again in general.
Navalnyy said the police came home this morning and took him to court.
He punished him for calling people to demonstrate through videos posted on YouTube's internet portal.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"We'll take them off the judge's salary," the critic Kremlin joked on twitter.
The Russian electoral commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential elections because he had previously been convicted of embezzlement.
However, Navalnyy, who is considered a fighter against corruption, considers the relevant judgment politically motivated.
A fine of 300,000 rubles, followed by 25,000 rubles on Thursday by the Court also handed down to two members of the Naval Election Team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaski.
Navalnyj entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure on the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend the Naval in the campaign in every way.
In February he was sentenced to five years' probation for stealing from the Kirovles Forest Company.
In May, the verdict confirmed the appeal court.
The verdict is so competent, which under Russian law prevents Naval from running.
Brothers fight for an empire worth over $500 million
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the creation of an empire by their Italian family, are stretching one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth more than $500 million.
Former director Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis resides in Toorak, just three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who has reached a dispute over joint assets and business assets to the highest court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business already in 2014, but the sharp dispute is constantly denied before the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother, Anna owns a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, the first business bought a family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
In this place, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a chain with 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the whole company in a $85 million bill.
For the money they bought additional properties and portfolio of the family De Lutis now includes offices, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrent, apartments at Gold Coast and Mt Buller and business centres in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one third of the company’s assets, while his father Colin, who Paul said is “a major driving force and dominant personality” of the De Lutis family, owns less than two thirds of the assets.
The court's file says Colin owns $316 million's property, while Paul manages the property for $176 million.
The division of assets and funds had just become problematic for Paul.
"Colin's proposal was loudly expressed in my eyes in his favour," Paul wrote in his sworn statement to the court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at peace, the first sitting of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are also now competing with who will control the existing business - from which Paul cut off Colin, according to his statement.
Colin opposes that this is not true and accuses Paul of mismanagement of certain properties.
In his previous sworn statement, Colin stated that he believed in a far-reaching solution to the conflict.
"My Italian origin dictates that the family is of all importance," he wrote.
The costs of the trial are rising. Hundreds of pages of sworn statements, e-mails and news from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer flood lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC and the defence attorneys of both parties.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and lavender from the 1950s and bought a tour in Brunswick in the 1970s.
For the money obtained by stopping property, they bought a real estate in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco “in the last year of high school, Paul was still a young, about 10 - year - old boy. ”
Anna De Lutis said that together with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of property to sons would be a good one.
"Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the family group De Lutis. Colin stated that Mark was compensated on his departure with $10 million and Luke with $26 million.
As Paul, Luke, and Mark stated, “they were not satisfied with the conditions of their financial compensation”.
Colin has been back ever since, despite the fact that he is a former member of the board of the AFL club, as stated in his 2015 autobiography by Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and best friend Colin.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
He replied only by means of a text report stating that, given the fact that the dispute was resolved before the court, “I have nothing to add. ”
"It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to deal with the whole matter before the court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, in one of the statements before the court, Colin stated that he was trying to adapt to the demands of his brother.
"Our father would be very dissatisfied if he saw our current situation," he was heard and added that "he is still hoping for a bright solution".
On Friday, all hopes were inconceivable.
"Our disputes will resolve in a short time of trial," Colin wrote.
The heat in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
The MHD drivers fancies water and summer clothes.
At the maternity school Na Chodovci in Prague 4, where there are now about 35 children, they go out only this morning.
The shell is after reconstruction and planted trees do not yet provide great shade.
It's not a swimming pool, but teachers shower kids in the mall.
In the afternoon, the children remain in classes where the blinds and curtains are withdrawn.
The air is trying to cool off the cleaner air because they don't have air conditioning.
It's also difficult for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is in the interior and exterior, exceeds the hygienic limits for maternity schools, so we should not even have open operation at this time," said school director Miloslava Makovičková.
In kindergarten there is a glass corridor, where the temperature is about 40 degrees Fahrenheit [40 ° C].
We're going to open in the morning after 6:00, close the windows, and we've got the blinds on the south side that we're protecting.
"But it won't help much," she added.
They have better conditions in the forest kindergarten at Hraza in Hostovice, where children spend most of their time outside.
We have tall trees on the property, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful cherry tree, there's a table under it, and we do things there," wrote school principal Barbora Kompanová.
Teachers try to go to the woods with their children, where there's more cold.
Children's wet caps and the program has different games with water.
"We have a hand-held sprayer that is used to spray flowers, and we use it to shower children," Kompanová said.
Also the head of the kindergarten in Novoborská Street, Prague, Jitka Vilimovská, said that children's teachers are trying to stay in the shade and water them.
"We have a fairly grown garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
They go out in the morning and then after 15 o'clock.
Every child must have a head covering.
Teachers also remind their children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, little sweetened tea or diluted juice, and they have pies of water in the garden.
Each day they also eat vegetable salads, and they always bring fresh fruit and vegetables, which parents sometimes bring to them.
"For example, today a mother brought about a ten-pound melon for the children," Makovičková added.
Drivers get water or summer same way.
Prague DPP provides them with hot water, ion drinks or summer drinks.
Driver cabs trams and buses are in most cases air-conditioned, said DPP Speaker Aneta Řehková.
They are air conditioned in addition to cabins, some trams are also in the passenger compartment.
The tram tracks of high temperature have not seriously damaged anything yet.
A minor damage occurred in a loop in the Hosts.
At current high temperatures, we make sure that the driver has enough drinks.
"The chilled drinking water is available in all loops, alternating points and lanes," said Řehková.
In coaches and in some alternate places, employees have available so-called moderns that produce chilled soda.
Drivers also receive soluble ion exchange drinks.
"They can also use the summer uniform, which enhances the comfort of drivers in their daily shifts," the speaker added.
The hot and dry weather of the last days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters throughout the Czech Republic destroyed 108, double the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, during the day when temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed over 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters employed mainly the fight against fire.
"They consider fires in the natural environment and also those associated with harvest work," said firefighter Nicole Zaoralová.
The firefighters were not relieved by the evening changes in the weather, when storms and floods replaced the heat in a number of places.
In connection with the storms, firefighters went to 236 hits.
In particular, the removal of fallen trees and branches.
"Most likely they interfered in the Central Bohemian region," continues Zaoralová.
However, firefighters also needed to be helped in Stvolínky, Czechoslovakia, where 60 people from the children’s camp were evacuated to safety because of the storm.
Tropical temperatures also added work to Prague paramedics.
On Tuesday and at night on Wednesday, ambulances drove to dozens of cases of poisoning with carbon dioxide with penalties.
People should therefore keep their water heaters checked, warn paramedics.
Carbon dioxide is a colourless gas without odour, which is released during imperfect combustion.
Signs of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache, and a feeling of fainting.
In case of suspicion of poisoning, the infected room should be left.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media diet.
Many tried it before him, and they always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If he does, he'll be the first.
The Politico portal stated that the new Chief of Staff in the White House plans to limit the flow of information from President Trump - including reports in television news - in the hope that he will keep Trump at sea.
Here's part of the report by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When the new Chief of Staff of the White House John F. Kelly met on the first day in his new post with the staff, he outlined the key problem of Trump's White House, which he intends to correct: incorrect information that is being given to the President.
Kelly told the employees that he must personally approve all the information - whether on paper or in speech - because the president can make a better decision on the basis of the correct information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but a lot of his predecessors got their teeth kicked out at Trump's control and his media presentation.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back several decades - and now that he's sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
"If Trump, as a candidate, was upset by honest reports, it was convenient to show him that he was spoken of in a positive light by many other media, which was easier to convince," he said in February for Politico Sam Nunberg, former campaign advisor.
Tara Palmireová from the Politico portal then wrote that “the key to keeping Trump’s tweets close — at least according to the words of the six former organizers of his campaign — is to ensure that Trump regularly monitors the media that sing praise to him.”
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's tendency to publicise his views on Twitter was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something the others don't know about - that Trump's tweets would be more exasperating if someone didn't control them.
We'll never know about the tweets that Trump never sent.
If his employees managed to keep him in check at least a few times, then their efforts did not go unpunished.
However, no one has yet been able to stop Trump from raising controversial topics on a regular basis.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which consists of rival factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by underscoring the materials - which they can but do not have to be reliable - which support their view of the world.
The Politico portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report in May on the tendency of the advisers to submit questionable information to the Head of State.
This is an example of such information from the reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Contemporary and former Trumpa officials argue that the president often reacts very angryly to negative media reports, especially reports of information leaks, and seeks to find their origin.
This situation occurred at the end of February when someone planted a copy of an article from GotNews.com to the website of Provocatar Charles C. Johnson - who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the “source of many leaks” of the White House.
No matter how much Johnson was forever reported on Twitter for harassment; or that he did not file any evidence; or that he had already published false accusations and later dismissed them.
Trump read the article and started asking about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Secretary of the White House Rob Porter “were trying to implement the system for the management and documentation of information received by President Trump”.
Would that work?
Kelly now, three months later, is trying to implement the same strategy.
Maybe it turns out he's a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsiveness doesn't just go away and his assistants are still fighting for power.
These unchangeable factors of Kelly's mission certainly make it difficult.
Tourists negotiate the trench and return to the “Millionary Quarter”
Several of the most tenable owners of homes in the English counties of West Midland are again released to despite determined tourists negotiating with local authorities the right to reclaim the fields for their settlements.
Tourists parked 20 caravans on a field near a flourishing street in Solihull, which is titled “Millionary Quarter”.
Bringing horses, children and the army of caravans, tourists return after being declared in May. They did not fear a trench that was dug on the spot under the regulations of the authorities to prevent their fall.
The tactical group found gaps in the defense and penetrated the field with caravans an unprotected gap that served as a route.
The angry inhabitants of the neighborhood attacked the city’s administration council of Solihull with the fact that ‘it was not able to solve’.
One of the residents who wished to remain anonymous said: ‘ They occupied the place on Monday evening after being moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones at other people.
The Governing Board should be ashamed of its inability to resolve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they're back.
There's more coming in last night, and there's probably more coming in today.'
She added that : ‘Birmingham Board knows how to deal with this problem. It uses court orders to protect parks.
I live on Streetsbrook and I don't want to continue to pay taxes until the board of directors settles with tourists.'
Another of the anonymous residents said: ‘ It’s ridiculous. We just recently watched the last of the departing tourists and now they’re back.
And this time there are even more of them, and this time they brought the horses with them.'
The press spokesman of the Solihull City’s Governing Council said: “We are aware of the illegal stay on the property near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with local police, are taking the necessary legal steps to resolve the problem.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that the most locals report any ill-treated or unlawful behaviour to the police on number 101.
We're going to get a whole picture that we're going to present to the court.'
The wife of the MEP hit a car in Brussels.
The government special brought him in.
The government special transports the injured Róbert Žitňansky to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport, and he was constantly under the control of Slovak doctors on board.
The long planned flight has gone without complications.
Róbert Žitňský reported that JOJ TV had a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of the summer.
He's been hit by a car, and he's been in serious shape ever since.
After his transfer to the country, he was transported to a specialized workplace in one of Bratislava hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of the Slovak MEP Jana Žitňanska from NOVA.
She didn't want to express herself to the incident.

Italians confirm in the fight against NGO rescue ships against immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of rescue vessels of the NGO which are arriving on the coast of Italy with migrants from the Mediterranean unless the NGO signs new rules governing their operations.
"If the NGO does not sign the new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to continue their operations," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minni's warning came the day after the Italian authorities confiscated the German rescue ship Jugend Rettet for suspicion of human trafficking, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The first-year rescue organisation refused to comment on the whole matter on the charges brought by the Italian state prosecutor Ambrogia Cartosios.
"There is and will always be a priority number one saving of human lives for us, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the rescue zones at the moment," said the organisation in a statement on social networks.
“All current accusations can be made only after the collection of all information and the assessment of the whole situation.”
Italian authorities have been monitoring the Jugend Rettet Iuventa ship since October.
Her crew is suspicious of the fact that she transported immigrants who were handed over directly to them by merchants with people on board over and over again.
At least one meeting, according to the applicant's file, only 1.3 miles from Libya's coast. The meeting was published by the Italian media.
The crew of the ship is suspected of breaking the law and bypassing the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in this area - out of humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental non-profit organisations involved in rescue operations have agreed to follow the Code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The last designated organisation stated on Thursday that the new rules were not necessary but acceptable since they did not represent any "substantial change or obstacle" with regard to rescue operations.
For example, the adoption of a new code of conduct was rejected by the Organization of Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which holds Nobel Prizes.
In the meantime, it has been reported that the sharp decline of immigrants in recent weeks who have landed in Italy in the context of rescue operations suggests that efforts to strengthen patrols along the coast of Libya and to cooperate with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In the last days we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He also identified plans for further negotiations that will take place this month with the Libyan mayors on the topic of economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that these countries are leaving behind in the hope of achieving Europe.
Shameful Mesarošová: From the overala, she had a silicone and cellulite!
Hot summer days are all about taking on the essentials that cover the most intimate parties.
Only Dominic Mesaroš does it the other way around.
For the afternoon meeting in the Prague zoo, where the actors, moderators, singers and anyone who had anything to do with TV prima, only hemmed, she hid her body in a mini-over.
And just a couple of regular moves and a model showed everyone its silicones, but also its ass.
He turned over to her how many times he cut himself between the poles, and he coughed up so high that you had to keep adjusting it.
No need for the attention of the gentlemen and the photographers present.
Michelle Carter convicted of sending suicide-promoting text messages to Conrad Roy.
The woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to imprisonment for two years for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter will serve 15 months of two-year prison sentence and then spend five years on parole.
Carter was sentenced in June for unintentional killing Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father told the court on Thursday: “The whole family is crushed.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left free until the decision.
She was threatened for up to 20 years by freedom, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and cream blouse, Carter stood in judgment on the spot with tears in her eyes, sweaty hands and eyes pointing to the ground.
"Her conduct killed Conrad Roy," she told the prosecutor to the judge.
"She finished his life to make it easy for herself.
She has failed to accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no remorse."
However, the legal representative of Carter said that these were “unhappy circumstances, which he deeply regretted. ”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “the age or level of maturity or even mental disorder has no significant impact on its performance”.
The prosecutor read Roy’s mother Roy’s statement: “There will be no one day left to grieve over the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain that we will carry with us forever," said the statement.
Roy's sister Camdyne Roy testified that she was “persecuted” by the fact that she would never take part in her brother's wedding and would never be the aunt of his children.
"The loss of the person I have seen since my birth is the pain I will bear for life," she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a valid law that affects a person who is helping to kill another person, and this case therefore sets a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in 2014 on the seat of a car poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case caught the attention of the whole nation after Carter’s text messages had been published, which prompted suicide.
"I don't care about the hang, jump out of the building, or stab myself," the text messages that Carter sent only two weeks before his death when Roy was on a family vacation.
A few minutes before she killed herself, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad," and "All you have to do is hit the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz stated that Carter longed for attention through Roy's death and ordered her to abstain from any comments in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who sided with Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted for murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years ago, the charges were released.
Ms Knox (30) published the statement in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison."
Audi will modify up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to acute response
Just the day prior to the notification of the Audi car manufacturer BMW indicated that he would offer his customers software update in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The president of BMW said that the company believes that there are "more intelligent possibilities than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich, which is the seat of the BMW - which consider prohibiting or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that he would adjust three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have promoted a large measure of the use of diesel atumobiles in Europe and the United States to comply with the regulation on carbon dioxide emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide that emits diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and may cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in the cost of automobiles to install installations to neutralise the gases released by diesel engines, which makes it more difficult for cars to be competitive.
While German car manufacturers face careful searches, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces charges of spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
Companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen, which, in an effort to meet the emission limits, installed software in their cars, which, when tested, reduced the amount of emissions issued, but under normal conditions, the software was deactivated.
Several senior representatives of Volkswagen have been charged in the United States and the others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former thermodynamic head of the Audi engine development department would be arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian national and does not apply to him as an extradition, so he can face the trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi became involved in the German police's criminal investigation into the Volkswagen car after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system that was to circumvent the European emission limits - and extended the charges that Audi is facing in the US.
Inclusion of Audi's car in the investigation may have an impeccable impact on Volkswagen: luxury car manufacturers account for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The plane landed in an emergency on the beach.
A man and a little girl died.
There was an accident on the beach Praia de São João in the area of Costa da Caparica, about 30 kilometres south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses on the SIC Noticias TV channel said that the plane flew close to the people who sunk on the beach before landing.
Some people from the beach allegedly fled from danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape from the machine.
A 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl died on the beach according to local media.
"The plane crashed them and they were dead," described local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both of them got out of the accident alive, and the cops took them to interrogation.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
And are motorways in the Czech Republic even final?
I'll give you a riddle.
It's uneducated, even though it started building in 1978.
Even though it's uneducated, it's constantly being corrected.
And it can't be built any longer, even if it has a building permit.
What's that?
Yes, castle D11.
The construction of her next section for at least a few months has stopped the Children's Earth movement.
We walkers get highways by bit, like when they cut into salamis.
They'll cover the wheel and then they'll see when and if we can get another one.
At the same time, we don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the driving time and we want to get the trucks going to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
The endless currents of the trucks pass directly through the city of Jaroměř or Náchod, which is not how to make a reasonable journey.
But so far, the last section of our dream highway has been operational in 2008, nine years ago.
No knock since.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometres of unfinished section to Hradec Králova began recently, and on other sections to Jaroměra began with archaeological research to start at the end of this year, you could hear the loud bangs of spies in eastern Bohemia.
I mean, nobody believed it anymore.
Last week, it turns out there's no going up this year.
And maybe not next year.
The Children's Party-Klub movement for sustainable transport from Brno has caused a decomposition.
The children of Earth repeat their D1 tactics.
Decision on the construction permit has been attacked in all respects.
In the decomposition, they request the review of all binding opinions already issued by all the authorities concerned.
For example, the castle magistrate, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Authority.
So far, we're leaving the D11 near the village with the pronunciation name Funeral.
So we're going down, we're just going down the highway, and suddenly we're on the side road, and we're preferring to get into the colonies.
The worst part is that you see stories like this all over the Republic.
A terrifying, constantly crowded road to Benešov, D1 or D8 highway.
Everyone has their own Funeral.
What do the Children of Earth require?
What is the essence of the problems of the construction of communications in the Czech Republic?
And why is the traffic network practically incomplete in the current system?

Levandule of the Province threatens climate change
The Levandules have become the symbol of the South-East French Province, but are now threatened by climate change.
Levanduli is being removed as a result of dry climate and harmful insects, causing the faces of researchers and farmers who are looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in the Province, stated: “The cultivation of lavender in the Province has been threatened because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings with it less precipitation in spring and autumn.
That affects the life span of lavender.
They also have gypsums and locusts carrying micro-bacteria that are good in the dry climate."
There's a lot at stake.
Levandule attracts tourists and oil from them is an important ingredient of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Places of long and beautiful flowers grow smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants.
The quantity of oil obtained from these levandules is, of course, smaller."
A more efficient distribution of water and slowing the evaporation of water from the soil may be a possible solution, but also the spray of lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and the breeding of more species resistant to dry weather.
Journalist murder highlights growing threats in Mexico
Employees of the weekly Riodoce regularly gather each Wednesday to discuss the news of the unrest in Sinaloa with the participation of organised criminals, corrupt officials and unscrupulous drug wars.
Today, however, under the pressure of recent events, it is mainly due to its own safety.
They learn that it is important to change their habits.
Two well-deserved journalists speak of what would be safer: taking their children with them to an office where someone attacked or left a grenade in 2009.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the black board: opponents, neutral and allies.
They ask journalists to give each word names - there is no need for proof, just to use imagination and premonition.
Select them from what - drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of taking money from government or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose task is to cover up criminal conduct.
Violence does not stop and the bodies are being executed across the country; journalists are constantly coming among them: according to the Journalists' Protection Committee, at least 25 are at least 25 from President Enrique Pena Nieta's entry into power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven were killed in all seven states this year.
Among them is co-founder of Riodioce periodical, editor and inspiration for colleagues Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and working as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence associated with drug trafficking.
His loss is tangible, although his presence is all-progressing - a large photograph of Valdez with the inscription “Justice”, on which shows the middleman, hangs in front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years old, have a shirt with a photo of Valdez with a smile on their face, with glasses on their noses and caps on Panama.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office has been set up in 2010 to deal with journalists' cases, so far, according to the opinion of the Journalists' Protection Committee, two suspects have been charged.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, so the murderers of journalists get to the court very exceptionally.
Reporters from Riodoce insist on informing about the violence that is taking place in Sinaloe; even though the destruction of grief and the said territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about the killers and without seeing justice, the safety meeting is meaningless, says Ibarra.
"It is a lie to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, no one can be trusted."
In the morning of May 15, Valdez left Riodoc headquarters in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to take a few blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 shots, apparently because of the name of the article - which can be translated as the 12th River.
The shooters then stepped into his car and knocked him out near the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a woman and two adult children.
It seems that in Culiacan, rumors spread rapidly.
In Valdez' case, however, there is only a suspicious silence.
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and his January release to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as the rival factions try to fill an empty space.
Every day several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloi and graveyards are filled with sophisticated two - floor mausoleums for drug kings, many of whom are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word “premature” means that one drug cartel controls the coastal state with precious ports and important routes that they travel to the United States of America.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez has been intimately acquainted with the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, co-founder and director Riodoce still opposes that he did not protect his friend.
She believes that two doubts have contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels who fought the war with the sons of Joaquín Guzman.
Peace could upset the sons; suspicious gang members bought all copies of the papers as they landed on the counters.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after confiscating other newspapers in which the same story was discovered.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is viewed as an important milestone in the fight against Mexican criminals against journalists.
He managed to survive so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
In Noroeste's periodical, he was practically a veteran when in 2003 he decided to sell his stock worth $50 and start with five Riodoce colleagues.
In Sinaloe ‘it was impossible to run a journalism without mentioning the drug trade’, Bojorquez said.
In time, Riodoce gained a good reputation for brave and truthful reporting; the newspapers began to prosper.
Journalists liked to go into the search for problematic topics and publish texts without censorship - readers were fascinated by reading stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after the establishment, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moores Cabot award for the report on Latin America.
The same year Valdez won the International Freedom of the Press Award for its brave reports on Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez openly admitted he was afraid.
"I was worried about my life," he said while accepting the price.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is “the way of life”, Valdez said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take on the role of a journalist - or play dumb.
I don't want anyone to ask me, "What did you do with the face of death... why didn't you say what was going on?"
He was a good friend who liked giving advice and hugging, a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
Always wearing his hat.
He often went to El Guayabo's bar across from the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: has this routine caused his death?
His death in them also raised questions about her own assumptions - how to do her job the best and stay alive?
"They don't like you messing with their wives, children, clean shops, secret landing areas."
"These things were forbidden," Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-defense.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel there's something out there, your hands are gone.
The problem is, editor Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that “chich is a sense that can be fooled... and then there was that thing with Javier. ”
The old rules according to him, like others, no longer apply in Sinaloae - as in the States Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to the toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
There are no mobile phones allowed in a room where Riodoce employees meet; a few days ago, spyware was discovered, which was bought by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
Before the building, two police officers find relief from a 40-degree heat in the shadow of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the State to protect Riodoce's offices, which are located in a four-storey building in the city district of Culiacan.
Journalists are drawn to whether these officers belong to those 50 percent of the law enforcement officers who are corrupt according to the government's statement.
This has been the last few months that journalists have gone to mountainous areas that essentially control drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the program this week.
The first of these is the murder of brother of former boxer Julio César Chávez in Sinaloe.
They are also dedicated to the suspicious government expenditure incurred in the hometown of the governor of the state.
Recently, there have also been several kidnappings in one of the most luxurious restaurants in Culiacán, just a block from the state's attorney's office.
Officially, no one announced the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so journalists were careful to write about what everyone in the city knows: that it restaurant is a favorite destination for drug dealers and politicians.
One journalist noted from the public records that the restaurant was registered under the name, which is associated with a certain policy, which is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which controls all levels of political scene almost all past century.
Several PRI governors have recently been charged with high-level corruption.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about the previous incidents that occurred in the restaurant, including the incident in which one of the sons of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmana escaped the military intervention force.
A month ago, readers would have read Valdez's section on this subject, which was the best source of information on kidnappings.
"Valdez would certainly solve the case," said Villarreal (46), who is called "El Flaco" for his thin figure.
"Now all the informers have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office turned into a warehouse of signs and stickers to protest against the killing of journalists. The employees certainly did not expect them to become activists in the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and went out the next morning to demonstrate in front of the prosecutor's office for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacán.
Only a burnt body has been discovered, and the authorities say it's Adame based on DNA analysis.
The activity of journalists varies throughout the country. Many of them organize protests and chat on the corridors and buildings “SOS printing”.
The director of the newspaper Bojorquez is the day he visits Washington, where he tries to get international support and achieve justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloy, who took place the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of monitoring journalists and killing journalists for reporting the truth.
In the meantime, she asked to be transferred to another department of concern that her anger might jeopardize her impartiality.
Valdez repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are "absorbed" by organised crime, corrupt officials and the public indifferent.
In his last book, "Narco-journalism" wrote that journalists die not only by the hands of drug cartels, but also by ordering politicians and security forces who cooperate with organised crime.
The Media Supervisory Group Articulo 19 accused more than half of all attacks on police journalists and public officials.
"You will die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez added.
The murders are obviously working.
No one will forget the death of a blogger, Marie Elizabeth Macías, who happened six years ago at the northern borders of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a message supposedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “This is how I ended up with my messages. ”
There was a keyboard and a headphone next to the severed head.
Some branch offices have decided to cease their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper based at the northern borders of the state of Chihuahua in response to the March murder of rapporteur Miroslav Breach.
Others continue, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after killing their director in 2004.
In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed drug cartel articles on the opening page entitled "What Do You Want From Us?"
Some journalists fled their homes or even across borders.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding a job in exile is hard as it is to get rid of the feeling that you are constantly being followed.
And journalists are being persecuted and killed, such as in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015, along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after the escape from Veracruze.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their work, it presents a great risk every day.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, which is why I became a journalist," he said.
It is Friday midnight and the staff of Riodoce sit in front of the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer when suddenly the phone rings.
They learn that 19 people died in a gunfight between gang members and police officers near the beach resort in Mazatlán.
The war is going down, just as many messages left by the members of the Syndicate have promised.
Journalists publish this news from a mobile phone on the Riodoce website.
Not a day goes by, and the opening headline changes again.
The police sirens sound indicates another shootout.
Bojorquez looks at the police patrol to see if they're paying attention.
If they're scared, they're not making it clear.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodical - whose middleman is an eloquent slogan for the whole Sinaloe - all the staff of Riodoce follow his steps.
"How could we think of leaving," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day that Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send her to the streets?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however scary.
Researchers have now discovered the conclusions of the first finds of an amazing creature the size of a rhino whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts called “Mona Lisa Dinosaurs” - found a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such a high degree that experts were able to determine the red-brown colour of his dirty skin and indicated that the dinosaur had a “problem past”.
An article in Current Biology said it was “the most preserved of the yet found armored dinosaurs and one of the best dinosaurs in the world”.
The fossil is a new species of Nodosauridae. Dinosaurus lived in the Kreda period, some 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked researchers who described him with the words “remarkable indeed”.
The inverted crease is still the best preserved fossil of its kind, according to National Geographic.
Behind the trail is Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on 21 March 2011 while drilling down the Suncor Millenium near Canada's Alberta.
He came across something that looked like a foreign object and decided to examine it closer.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrell Museum of Paleontology.
Researchers spent the next six years discovering an animal from a vast piece of land weighing 1100 kg.
When the work is completed, the dinosaur is ready to reveal.
“It’s enough to warm your eyes and believe he’s asleep,” said Caleb Brown, director of the work and natural scientist of the Royal Tyrell Museum, where the animal is exposed.
“It will certainly be recorded in history as one of the most beautiful and preserved species of dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa Dinosaurs.”
By studying his skin, researchers found that this herbivores - although covered with armor and reminded the walking tank - were likely to face a serious threat from the carnivorous dinosaurs.
Heavy-armed dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a cloaking system that uses many animals today.
Experts claim that this allowed him to blend better with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The cloaking system suggests that he was a favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
Reports of 110 million years old dinosaurs in Nodosauridae have first appeared in the paper in May. Currently available for viewing at the Royal Tyrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers gave him the name Borealopelta markmitchelli after the technician of Mark Mitchell's museum, who spent more than 7,000 hours with the team carefully exposing fossils.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved condition of fossils, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document patterns and shapes of drawers and armor all over the body.
They discovered the method of disguise commonly used by today’s animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, the findings of researchers are surprising because Borealopelta's size far exceeds today's animals using the same technique.
It is therefore possible that dinosaurs were so many predators that evolution gave the advantage of masking before confrontation in survival.
Many of the present animals with masking - a pile of deer, zebra and or belt - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the nosodaurus had to fight for his surviving literally.
“The surrender of a huge and heavily armed dinosaur illustrates the dangers posed by predators during the chalk period,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic ingredients contained in shupins also revealed that the dinosaur skin was likely red-coloured.
Researchers continue their study of the animal and search for further knowledge of his life, including the preserved stomach content, to search for his last meal.
He believes that the dinosaur fell into the river after his death and was taken to the sea, where he sank to the bottom.
In the Alberty area at that time, the climate was the same as in today's Florida and the rivers and oceans were much farther inland than it is today.
“This nodoosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved spinach skin and at the same time preserved in three dimensions and so we can see its original size,” said Brown.
‘For these reasons, the animal looks practically the same as at the time of the chalk.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; you just need to fix your eyes a little bit and it seems like he's just sleeping.'
During the chalky period, huge terropods, masseal dinosaurs, walked across the Earth, moving on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could have been the favorite prey of his equally fearsome ancestors.
They include Acrocanthosaurus, 11.5 metres long monster with a weight of over 6 tons.
Researchers whose latest findings were published in the magazine Current Biology believe that Borealopelt's body was washed out into the sea after it was mummified in the mud.
Behind the trail is Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on 21 March 2011 while drilling at the lower Suncor Millenium near Canada's Alberta.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and armor, which is also complete from the czech to the hip.
The animal reached an average length of 5 metres and weighed up to 1300 kg.
He had two and a half inches of hair coming out of his shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivoresman razed the territory of today's Canada until he ended up in a river that floated him into the sea.
His underwater tomb preserved the body in perfect condition.
The fossil remains of this species are preserved to the extent that the armored fences around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, “the finding of such a preserved individual can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I watch him, the shocking finding seems to me.
The fossil remains of this species are preserved to the extent that the armored fences around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
On his side lies his right front leg with his fingers pointing up.
I can easily count the drawers on his feet.'
How did one activist know the answer to the question, 'Whose Streets?'
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrello shook her whole body.
The day after she arrived in New York City, her family from St. Louis sat on a bed in Airbnb's room and walked through her Facebook posts on her phone.
She ran into a college student's contribution.
"The police just shot an 18-year-old boy whose body is still on the street," he stood there.
She wondered that no one else had written this post to her, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The user @TheePharoah kept retweeting her contributions to the wall.
Rapper from St. Louis posted on Twitter his contributions to the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old young man who was shot by a white - skin officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photograph of Brown's body, which lies impersonal on the street, from which no one took it even after four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrello thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She hung up the phone to come back to him on the night that she was watching tweets about people who were gathering on the Canfield Drive.
She watched photos of police tapes and screaming people. One of the men claimed that the father of the victim was holding a sign with the inscription “The Ferguson Police killed my unarmed son” in his hand!
She was watching live news - one of the police was standing in front of a group of protestors, holding a lead in her hand and at the other end of his barking dog.
In another video he held another officer, as she stated, in his hand, a gun pointing at the crowd, saying: “I will kill you all... animals.”
"It's not normal," Ferrello said.
"This is not the type of murder that we have used to and that we can call normal.
I felt goose skin all over my body.
"I was angry and I cried."
She immediately booked her return flight, and on the second day she was on her way home.
After landing at 11:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrellove and the town of Ferguson describes a new document entitled “Whose Streets” over the next three years, which will appear in the August 11th cinema.
It is a story of survival and protests, love and opposition, strength and integrity told from the perspective of people living in the community who go to the streets and demand answers.
On her way to Ferguson, Ferrello started a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a flower uniform and the same floral face - on the subject they had discussed many times before - "for experience with blacks".
"Do you remember how I taught you how black people had to fight for what they believed in?" remembers the conversation.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old and that's not right."
"It was not considered that I would not take it with me," Ferrello later said.
"Today's events are the culmination of... events that have occurred in the past.
She had to know and see for herself and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but at the same time she had to learn the difference between different layers of experience with blacks and what we had to do to free ourselves.
Although I am able to provide her with conditions in which she will not experience racism on her own skin, she does not differ in any way from another black child.
I feel that if I were to protect her from this experience, I would only hurt her."
Upon arriving in Ferguson, the first stop on the South Florissant Road was against the police department, which became the base of activists who were awaiting the words of Officer Darren Wilson about his possible involvement in the incident.
This is where the Ferrellas met their daughter with a local entrepreneur who was preparing for the rest of the food.
Together, they prepared the food for the biscuits and helped to deliver it to Protestants.
In the eyes of Ferrella, a new type of activism was slowly born.
"My activism turned upside down after August 9th," Ferrello said, adding that when she studied at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn association and sought to introduce health care and food in black communities.
"I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, during the evening demonstration, Ferrello met a later associate director of the documentary, Sabah Folayan.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "just document" the events under way.
Ferrell, however, thought: “Are you working on a document or trying to find a story that could be used?”
Such a type of skepticism infiltrated the community through many people, often white people, who wanted to earn on pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview: “We heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson were very often neglected and that we wanted to change.”
Folayan has already cooperated with co-director Damon Davis, a respected local artist who deals with the subject of prisoners in the death row.
His involvement in the project was also integrated by Ferrell and with the other six local residents, who were followed by the "Whose Streets?" team in the years following the murder of Brown.
"No one speaks for us in this document, but it is our statement," Davis said.
"It was important to me - how these people will be represented - because in the same way I will be represented."
While the aim of the document was not to focus on the experiences of Ferrellav - in an effort to show that the movement "is not about a savior leader, but about bringing the community closer together," Folayan said - it turned out that it was she who was the most unveiled against participating in filming.
The document “Whose Streets?” describes the very personal aspect of Ferrello’s life, the book she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt like naked," Ferrello said with a smile on her face, thinking at the first moment when she saw the final version of the document.
"But I understand that in order to do this job and police the blacks, I must open up."
In addition, Ferrella’s story highlights the role of an extraordinarily black woman in the broader aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created in response to the killing of Teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 on social media campaigns under #BlackLivesMatter - they call themselves a marvel.
"Black eccentric women in leading positions are ultimately worth keeping the movement," Ferrello said, "because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black and extraordinary women must bear the burden of these events."
Folayan agrees with this statement and adds that “the movement is in fact supported by black women and a large number of eccentric black women.”
Nevertheless, it insists that "this is not just an affirmative matter" and that Ferrello is not the main hero of the document because of his views.
"It was it that was the driving force and the source of energy," she said.
"that it was found in the front lines is not a coincidence, because life on these crosses in the skin of a black divinant woman is dangerous.
You can feel the energy rush before the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, cameras cleared their positions on television stations, but heavy racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrella's been serving two and a half years on a roadblock condition for demonstrations.
The social political atmosphere in the area she calls home described as "Disorder."
Yet, she does not struggle to commit herself to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our chains."
The field was on fire in Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters went to the scene, and a helicopter also helped.
Near the Czech Brod in Cologne, between the municipalities of Biljana and Liblice, there have been a burning field since 14:00 with a spread of about 15 hectares.
The fire stopped spreading around 15:15, firefighters declared the third stage of fire alarm from four possible.
According to firefighter Ladislav Holomčík, the fire from the air helped to fire the helicopter.
At 6 p.m. fire extinguished the fire, the fire caused damage for 700,000 crowns.
Tens of professional and voluntary firefighters fought the flames on the spot.
The fire was caused by a technical malfunction in the motorcade.
Hasit also helped with the helicopter, which made a total of six outflows of water.
"The place of intervention we handed over to the owner, until 8 p.m. tomorrow he will be guarded by a unit of volunteer firefighters," Holomčík said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning DNA
In the middle of one of the rooms of New York Fridman Gallery is located just a few faces of different shades of the skin - white, black and brown - hung from the ceiling on the wires. Each one of them looks like the previous one.
All 30 portraits were created by Heather Dewey-Hagborg, an artist from oral swabs and hair sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where a former analyst is serving 35 years of punishment for illegal publication of secret cablegrams on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched on August 2nd, bears the name A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines his experience with technology, information and art, and Manning with a transsexual and pioneering dissident whose punishment was reduced by Obama three days before he left the presidency of the United States.
The algorithmic DNA analysis of Manning and using 30 portraits to illustrate what a person with this genome would look like, created Dewey-Hagborg's brittle, if not an intellectual comment on DNA subjectivity - as well as the many ways in which DNA can be interpreted - and the insensible determinism of these interpretations, as well as identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, has been talking about being considered a woman since her youth. She was convicted in 2013 on the basis of 20 charges, including violations of six spying laws, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photos were detained by prison staff. Only one black and white photo of lower quality, on which Manning, clearly concerned, sits on the driver's seat in a platinum blonde wig, which is now connected.
In 2015, positive reactions to the Dewey-Hagborg project of 2012 Stranger Visions continued to grow.
As part of this project Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarettes and chewing gum - to create a picture of possible images of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They had an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to add an article to the portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained on the occasion of the opening of the new exhibition.
However, visits and photography were not allowed, so they asked Chelsea if she would be interested in DNA portraits.
The artist and her incarcerated muse became fragrant within two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic with the name Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, which presented a vision of what would have happened if Chelsea had been pardoned and could participate in the exhibition in person.
In fact, President Obama asked for the release of Manning a few days after the release of the comic book, which was a welcome change after several unbearable years spent in the Kansas military prison.
It is indeed interesting that the exhibition is taking place just at a time when Donald Trump is waging a war with people who are trying to publish government information and transgender soldiers while trying to find new ways of stirring up their tweets in areas that he should support.
In response to a question about this special timing, Dewey-Hagborg said that "everything is happening for a reason".
Under the artist's statement on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls for its huge signature (written by “i” in the surname is stamped with the heart) at the end of “self-affiliated faction based on sex, race, sexuality and culture”.
On the opposite side are a sequence of her mitochondrial DNA - a hundred letters C, G and A marked with pencil.
The classification of 200 letters (or nucleotide, according to the sophisticated scientific dictionary artist) wanted to illustrate Dewey-Hagborg how surprisingly similar, at least after the biological page, all of us.
"I hope that people will take it from this that our genome does not matter who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it after themselves," Dewey-Hagborg said.
"DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last copy of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page of the above graphic novels.
Displays Manning, which emerges in the way of King Kong from the United States Disiplinary Barracks prison with a megaphone in his hand.
"If they prevent you from speaking, they will win," it says.
"Never let yourself be silent."
"It is a direct transcript from one of the letters," said a Philadelphia artist.
"When I think about it, I get goose bumps."
Manning has not personally visited the exhibition - which has been predicted in the comic book - but when it does, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by its masks, its own genomes, classified as a crowd of Protestants.
Which was also the purpose of the exhibition, including nearly 160 cm high Maning statues, on which the pencil records its genetic haplogroup.
"In the past they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted them to blow off the crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said about the portraits.
"I wanted instructions on the impression of mass movement, which takes on the form of Chelsea and frees her."
Professor Northwestern University and employee of Oxford University wanted for murder
On these days, a nationwide search is under way for Professor Northwestern University and employees of Oxford University who are being prosecuted for suspected murder of a man who was stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police reported.
On Monday, an arrest warrant was issued for the murder of a first-degree man named Wyndham Lathe (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranneau, reports Cook County's file.
The document states that Cornell-Duranneau (26) died of several stab wounds.
Chicago P.D. said the body of the deceased was found on July 27th.
Police officers were alerted to this by telephone. Upon arrival in Grand Plaza Apartments, they found a victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranneau was pronounced dead on the scene, and detectives are investigating a murder case, and the police are looking for both suspects, and the authorities have reported.
Lath has been working in the position of associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Northwestern since 2007.
Alan K. Cubage, vice president of the University for Public Relations, stated in his e-mail statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and was banned from entering the university's school premises.
"The entire matter is now being investigated by the competent authorities and the University of Northwestern is fully cooperating with them," Cubage said.
Warren is an executive financial administrator at Oxford University.
Speaking University and Somerville College stated in a statement sent by e-mail: "The British police have contacted us and we are ready to assist US police as well."
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were really shocked and wished to report to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, in contact with the public of the Chicago Police Department, said he called on suspects to surrender to the competent authorities.
"The police have information about their whereabouts and the search for suspects is being stepped up," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities have been assisted in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager, who was alerted to the events that were to occur in apartment No. 1008.
The police described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi stated that it is not clear if the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lath and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe that Professor Latham knew his victim," said Guglielmi.
The management of the Grand Plaza issued a statement for all residents: “Police are now working on setting up a timeline and profile of the victim and investigating various motives, including domestic violence.”
"We will complete WADA's plan in the near future" - Russian Prime Minister Mutko
Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko stated that it would not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-doping Agency (RUSADA).
"As of now, part of the criteria for the new plan have been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this, the WADA plan was updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan to comply with the Code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutek, the code does not contain anything that Russia should worry about.
"All have been notified and all will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the above criteria calls for public notification of the results of the WADA investigation, which was investigated by Richard McLaren, about alleged sponsorship of Russian athletes' doping by the government.
On this subject, Mutko said: “We know the investigation because our anti-doping system has obviously failed.
All measures have been taken.
However, there have been no state programmes in our country and therefore we cannot admit to anything that never existed."
Mutkov's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russian RSport Smirnov, he admitted the problems of Russian anti-doping agents, but he added: “In many ways, we have stated that the report contains controversial attitudes and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report completely without reservation," said Smirnov.
WADA suspected RUSADU of carrying out doping controls within Russia in November 2015 immediately prior to the doping scandal.
However, the organisation allowed planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-doping Agency (UKAD) in June this year.
Following a visit to the Moscow headquarters in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Nigli stated that RUSADA is "on the right track" to restore validity.
The police accused three people, one of them juveniles.
Police accused three men of setting up a medieval fire at a rare wooden church in Třince-Gutech on Friedecko-Městeck.
One accused is juvenile, all three are Czech nationalities.
Up to 15 years of imprisonment threatens them for the criminal act of general threat.
Reporters were told today by Moravian police director Tomáš Kužel.
According to him, it was a deliberate crime.
"It is a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole matter," said Kužel.
He said the police would be working on a possible way to take the accused into custody.
It is not possible to publish further information according to the Director.
"I can't tell you any more, because it's true that criminal police and investigators are actually working on matters," said Kužel.
The wooden church of God’s body in Gutech dates back to the 16th century.
He was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
The material damage is estimated at tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.
After the fire, the rebuilding of the church began to be considered.
Most of the costs should be covered by the insurance policy, the additional costs are prepared to be shared with the Ministry of Culture and the city, the public collection is also being prepared and the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. local parishes, is being counted.
A similar church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrab also destroyed a fire 15 years ago.
This caused an electrical failure at the time.
Then there was an exact copy in his place.
The state counts with citizens in defense of the state.
Support their training.
With financial support for societies used in the defence of the state, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of training trainers, the objective of the law on the preparedness of citizens for the defence of the state is to count.
The Ministry of Defence, which has been entrusted with its processing with the government's task, promises that it will thus improve Czech physical fitness and their ability to use in crisis situations.
This is based on a proposal the Ministry has prepared.
If the law had been passed in the future, the state would have spent hundreds of millions of crowns in support of the defence.
The basic objective of the proposal is, according to its authors, to create an effective system that would help to increase the willingness of the Czech population to defend the State, beyond the exercise of the duty of defence and on the basis of volunteerism.
For example, the state would financially or materially support the communities of radio amateurs, shooters or quinologists and would enable them to increase the ability of their members.
In return, he would have received data on people willing to come to the country at a time of crisis for assistance and on their abilities or material equipment.
Accreditation instructors could also be available to assist the community and other stakeholders in training or education.
It also counts as organizing words with war veterans or people who behaved heroically.
One possible variant assumes that a new office would be established to administer and coordinate the project.
The authors stress that participation of people should be voluntary and that the state would use their abilities only after the threat has been declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual crackdown of previously obvious borders between individual types of threats," is stated in the intention with reference to the danger of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministers noted that it is therefore necessary to concentrate on supporting as many capabilities as possible, not just those of the military.
"The fundamental objective of the intention is to create a very broad base that will enable every citizen to respond in a qualified manner to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect himself, to contribute, where appropriate, to the protection of others, and to misbehaviour, not to make it difficult for the Czech Republic to carry out the tasks of the armed forces."
The adoption of the law would bring near financial demands.
Their above will depend, according to the Ministry, on the chosen variant.
For example, the Authority envisages financial support for projects to prepare citizens for state defence up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were to be established, its operation could cost around 60 million crowns a year.
More money would go to wages or to build an information system.
The proposal also assumes that there would have to be an extension of the scope of the regional military headquarters, which would work together with 42 other soldiers.
The Ministry's representatives had previously indicated that the law should also help resolve the disagreement of certain Czech politicians with the introduction of a European Union Directive on weapons holding.
Its adoption would allow shooters who will be part of the system to retain certain weapons covered by the directive.
The startups that will help your company not become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the level of satisfaction of the employees of her e-commerce startup, but she did not find a suitable survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even misleading.
And while promising anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their distrust in the process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity," said Errett, owner of the e-commerce company of Madison Reed's hair care company based in San Francisco, which employs 75 people.
So she asked for help from the outside.
New start-ups from the human resources sector are constantly emerging in the market, helping companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing a software with a specific purpose of measuring employees' obligations, they allow companies to conduct rapid voting, target specific teams and demographic groups, further offers complete anonymity of employees and a hot line for complaints, and in some cases also allow informers to bypass supervisors and contact the Director directly.
"There are tools on the market like Strava and Fitbit that monitor your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of the Glint launch site in Reedwood City.
Errett stated that Glint had three years of greater awareness of what her employees thought and how she felt.
In addition to quick research and voting of specific teams, Glint offers a company's temperature map and an up-to-date overview of the most complaints groups, as well as an overview of low rating managers - which allows users to work on repairs.
Companies are beginning to realise that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the working environment - in case they become another Uber - which is thrown away in scandals after the former employee has published on his blog a contribution describing the corporate environment and harassing employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint represents demand for research of corporate culture a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and complication sector may exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Startup Convert from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before Uber scandals.
Amongst almost 600 clients of the Convert are Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber also accepted under his wings.
Like Glint, Convert allows companies to send custom "light" surveys, collect confidential information in real time, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If the problem is complicated by the Director-General, complaints are addressed directly to the Board of Directors.
"The Court of Public Opinion has authorized regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and executive director of the Convergence launch.
If the company is convicted of mistreatment with its employees or non-ethical behaviour - and if the regulators do not intervene - it can suffer costly consequences as a result of the boycott of customers, the exhaustion of employees or judicial proceedings, Quinlan added.
Ruby Tuesday's restaurant network, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, uses Convert over a year to raise employees' awareness of corporate principles and procedures and to ensure an easy way to contact corporate leadership.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to check his phone number or e-mail for the company's management, officially file a complaint and hope for a clear solution.
Often it was a frightening and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, general representative of Ruby Tuesday, where there was no reliable way of tracking employee complaints.
Now that the company is using the Convergence, quick detection and problem solving is ensured, which has never been reached before by managers sitting in offices, within a mile of the real solution of complaints - a tool of discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
"It follows the holistic, overall view of employee experience," said Vitrano, who manages Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"At the same time, we protect shareholders from legal disputes by employees."
The companies stopped taking the ethics, values and participation of employees on a slight scale in 2002 after Arthur Andersen’s accountant collapsed after Enron’s fall in the case of the abuse of the ethical rights of employees, Quinlan said.
But only when “you turned the whole thing on to social media” did societies realize that in the online world they could not simply hide their skeletons in the closet.
"Before people started using technology to track ethics, they relied on faith," Quinlan added.
Glint and Convert offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by courageous capital investors that supported both startups.
The contractor chose $10 million in total as part of his February campaign by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital and finally took back $47 million in capital.
Glint won $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and received $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and risk capital.
The increasing number of studies clearly confirms that today’s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, they are not the main advantages of high wages and interesting projects.
Employees want to see that they are accepted and appreciated and that they are devoted their time to a company that is pursuing a positive mission.
"If people are happy in their work, they feel that their voice is heard and that their work is rewarding, they strive for the success of society," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Benefits LinkedIn, who uses Convert and Glint.
Investors earn if companies and companies prosper if they are satisfied with their employees.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market to ensure the commitment and commitment of employees to the company, it is not surprising that there are many investors who will support this effort.
It is important, according to work culture experts, to have data on staff satisfaction.
But the data itself is pointless if society does not take the necessary steps.
The fact is that once the company requests feedback from its employees, there can be major changes.
And if the change doesn't happen quickly - in the worst case at all - it can cause disappointment and dissatisfaction of employees.
"When you ask for 4000 opinions, you must be prepared for 4000 conversations," said Russell Raath, Director of Consulting at Kotter International, who was a witness to many companies that relied too heavily on data itself.
“Because once you don’t get it over with, the employees start asking themselves, ‘ Did they hear me at all?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, then why should I care?" "
Madison Reed, who now conducts a regular survey among employees on a regular basis every month, is able, thanks to Glint, to solve the problem within one day, Errett said.
After collecting feedback from staff who were frustrated by slow decision-making and quality of communication, Erretová managed to reorganise several teams within the company and start training communication to resolve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday receives a very important view of her employees and hopes to achieve long-term employment in a field that is known to be a frequent discharge.
"If you do not seek to create a transparent working environment, employees will not believe you," Vitrano added.
"As soon as you lose employees, you lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company is failing."
Thursday's become the hottest day.
Thursday is with 38,3 degrees registered in The Watchtower in Hodonínsk so far the warmest day of the year in the Czech Republic.
He overcame the Tuesday, which was originally the warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
The workers of the Czech Institute of Hydrometeorology reported this.
Tuesday, but Thursday, there were no many temperature records.
The heat hit Moravia mainly, and it was mostly cloudy in the Czech Republic.
On Tuesday, records of 35 out of 145 meteorological stations over 30 years of age were overcome or balanced.
On Thursday, only nine long-term stations recorded a record.
For example, at The Watchtower today’s temperature was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In Lednica in Břeclavsk today, 37.4 degrees surpassed the original maximum by four tenths of the degree and in Pohorice in Brno, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records as well as the 2013 Watchtower record.
High temperatures today appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After the Watchtower was the biggest heat in Dyjakovice in Znojamsk and Broda nad Dyja in Břeclavsk, where the mercury rose to 37.8 degrees, but the record failed.
On the contrary, for example, in the Western and North-West Czech Republic, today’s highest temperature was just about 22 degrees Celsius, according to the Czech Republic.
"The heat there began to grow until this afternoon," the meteorologists reported.
Current heats in the Czech Republic will gradually fade, according to the ČHMÚ, and more heavy rain could come on Sunday.
In most Moravian places, however, high temperatures remain on Fridays and on the south-east of Moravia on Saturdays as well.
We got so sick in here.
Billionaires don't have the same voice in elections as any one-year-old man in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not everyone is as shy as Andrej Babish, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of the Penty Marek Dospiva, along with other colleagues in the water Martin Burdo and Antonín Fryc, sponsores the Robejško Realistics.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and the entrepreneur in the real estate of Pavel Sehnal, who is also the chairman of his party.
The convict and the king of Czech gambling, Ivo Valenta, took over the Party of Privates.
The political movement Agrofert, as the project by Andrej Babiše was reluctant to name the mayor Jaroslav Nimec, is a chapter for himself.
The Mayors caught their billionaires recently.
It's Dalibor Grandpa, the owner of the company on Jablotron's security facility.
According to his own words, he enters politics to do good.
Entrée in the mayoral jersey didn't do much for Grandpa.
"I've never had little goals," said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is to move ANO so that the Mayor's movement gets 20 percent in the elections.
Leckdo smiled.
The grandfather's renunciation, however, is more significant.
Billionaire Dalibor Grandpa is a man of firm opinion.
Although he intends to refer to the votes of the voters in the suit of Mayors, he continues to support Andrej Babiš.
Babiš's grandfather supported the previous parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a shot-off speaker and does not control a loving rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote about him before the 2013 elections.
But it certainly doesn't go into politics because it wants to make a personal improvement.
Babish will remain a hero to me.
He's willing to step out of his control world and do something for all of us.
Shortly after being presented as a new strength by the Mayors, he confessed his admiration for Babylon again.
And he said he wanted the Mayors to learn possible cooperation with Babish.
Some may appreciate that Grandpa does not change his mind and is worthy of his own, no matter what jersey he wears.
Others may speculate whether Babish sends to the Mayors to build his own spot for someone so clumsy.
Others may ask whether the chief of Jablotron, for example, broke up with the head of Agrofert, in a bad business and is not looking for another way to defend his business rival.
The first grandfather’s public talk was not just about Babiš.
Grandpa promised to send ten million crowns to the Mayors.
And if they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been hard for someone to stop saying that.
In 2010 Zdeněk Bakala, a court-appointed gauner, threw millions at all parties before the elections.
The political division of the security agency Víta Barta, TOP 09 and the civil Democrats came together this way to nearly 30 million.
But today is another time.
The law forbids any political party to give more than three million.
By the time Grandpa enters politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Maybe he shouldn't ask himself why politics is so bad about us.
His first days in politics then Grandpa crowned with a proposal for tax advantages for families with children studied.
People with high school education will come to us about 50 grand a month.
The ones with the base on less than 20.
A man of fifty thousand is rich in the proportions here.
The one with the 20 poor.
In Grandfather's vision, the poor are rightly taxed and the rich enjoy the benefits of the functioning of the social state to which they do not share too much.
The rich simply need help not to put up with the need.
The mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition, and Babish can shake hands.
Even thanks to Grandpa, we can confirm that the billionaires are not good people.
Then there's the question of who to vote.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who are members and members of their party, neither citizens nor citizens of the state, who are not their employees and the country as their property.
And in the end, those who desire to live well in a prosperous land for all men, not only for some.
Nobody wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex had to be reduced by 234 million.
Real estate sales are sometimes not easy.
And sometimes he doesn't have 11 bedrooms, a beautiful view of the sea, or the fact that he sells real estate to President Donald Trump.
When selling the villa complex Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price went down at an incredible £8 million.
He's been reporting on the Mirror.co.uk website.
The brochure says about the land: "Hello, Donald J. Trump."
Avoid the place like no other.
But neither did the association of the real estate company with the US president defend an extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to lower the price of his Caribbean headquarters by an incredible eight million pounds.
The original price of the property was 21.5 million pounds, the final price dropped to 13 million pounds.
Even after discount, the villa complex costs about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And there's nothing to be surprised about.
The impressive 5 acres in the Caribbean island of St. Martin has 12 fully equipped bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The pool and tennis courts are part of the property.
There are tens of palm trees planted on the property.
From the terrace is a beautiful view of the sea.
According to realistic experts, the price showed that the connection with the President was not sufficient to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the usual price of properties on the island.
Trump bought real estate in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid around £15 million.
The property was to be purchased for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on St. Martin's Island.
But with a new price, he's in second place.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at 13.5 million pounds.
NCAA has decided to end two trainings a day.
The 11th A.M.A. is approaching and UCLA American football players are racing at the side line of the new school playground.
Some of them take off their jerseys and reveal their sweaty backs, an unmistakable sign on the first day of the training camp.
For most of the team members these few minutes nothing is added to the midday break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will go to the rooms after three hours of training to study for the final exams before returning to Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that takes place at 6:30 am.
"These guys will have a real hangover for the next three days," coach Bruins Jim Mora said a moment before Monday's overturned on Tuesday.
Disposal of two trainers in one day wants NCAA to make it easier for players - paradoxically, training days are even longer - at least until Friday, when final exams end.
That's why the first three UCLA trainings are scheduled at 19:15 - to fit into many students' already crowded diary.
For the first time in six seasons spent by Mora in the position of coach in Westwood, the Bruins training camp begins a week before last year and training is limited during the summer semester. Its impact on this is also intended to limit the number of coaches from two to one day.
A total of 18 trainings are planned by August 20th, and formal preparations begin for the first match against the Texas A&M team, which takes place in September.
It must have been heard that it supports the NCAA decision, although it added another item to an already loaded player's diary.
"Three or four days are the players under great stress and it is very exhausting for them," Mora said.
"But no one has given up, everyone is trying. They are great.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down."
UCLA will be closed after the training camp has been completed, which will not be easy when looking at the clear lines of surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and the luxurious hotel Luskin Center, which was occupied by players after harvesting the protection network behind the goal line.
The players of Bruins should have the hotel occupied starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that when the rooms are empty during the season, there might be a problem.
"The land will be guarded by security services," Mora added.
“It is taken care of for safety, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our training.
He deals well with this material.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security, as well as parking lot No. 8.
We'll use our resources to the maximum.
I believe everything will work out.
It's all planned."
Facebook plans to check more closely the facts to limit the number of false messages
Facebook will send more potentially false articles to check third parties and display findings under its original contributions in an effort to fight so-called "fact news", the biggest social network on Thursday.
The company writes on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, which will send third parties to verify and potentially display the results of the survey under its original contributions.
Facebook has been identified as one of the main sources of false reports, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports influenced the President of the United States last year's election.
The French voters are flooded with false reports about the May presidential elections and Germany is planning to impose a penalty on the social media in advance of the September elections if they do not quickly remove the angry contributions.
On Thursday, Facebook stated in its next statement issued in Germany that it is planning to run a new testing function for false reports in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to displaying third-party certified reports, people are asking for more content to be better informed and can make the right decision on what they can share," Sara Su said on her blog, a product reporting manager for Facebook.
She added that Facebook continues to test the function of "related articles" and is also working on other changes to reduce the number of false reports.
Artwork graphic novels: the story of A Castle in England
The small castle of Scotney Castle recently played a major role in the music video of the Squeeze group and also found its refuge in it Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
Scotney, however, witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy spot near the Bewl River in the British Kent River, which inspired the curly Jamie Rhodes of the York County - a familiar interest in historical documents - in creating graphic novels.
"I am fascinated by the writing of a man who is 300 years after death," says Rhodes with a serious face.
"When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection."
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of families who lived in the castle of Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Eduardo period. Each story illustrates a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not the first Rhodes book inspired by archives: it is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), the collection of inspired documents of the British Library - a project which was very emotional for him.
"I was captured by a fingerprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for the Jacobites," he said.
"This is the fingerprint of his finger!
And letters always smell like smoke because in those times you had to light a candle to read.
If I can smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How I love archives!"
For someone so fascinated by old papers, support is from the National Trust and Arts Council England and the opportunity to spend almost four months in the castle almost like a dream. ("To be honest, I have extended my stay a little.")
Rhodes spent time exploring the Victorian “new” castle, walking through archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of hyenas on the wall and bottles that were thrown centuries later in the trenches.
He walked through the property and examined the ruins of the old castle, spoke to the hymns, gardeners, and sometimes also with the artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
At night, he drank whiskey and wrote.
The confidential history of Scotney is relatively unknown as the National Trust gained access to documents only in 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived at the site ten years later, employees were only beginning to enter the archives that Rhodes described in words, as when “the aristocrats of many centuries spread their hands with the words, ‘Take it into the attic’.
Diaries, letters from times of the British Empire, maps showing assets: "You may think the land dispute is boring," said Rhodes, "but I ran into one case where two families were drawn to shore.
Stop it, people!"
Some stories in the book use the castle as a reflection bridge and dive deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves a newly built castle to join the English Uprising in 1381.
"I found a record of rebellion in the castle of 1380, which was in the book called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," said Rhodes.
"The English uprising actually started in this area and I thought that rebellion is a good starting point.
Maybe they have something to do with each other."
Other stories are closely connected with the history of the castle - such as The Priest, who tells the story of the Jesuit priest, whose family had been hiding Darrell for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smugler about a 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled a coffin of stones (which was discovered only a few years after the discovery of the coffin).
Rhodes’ favorite family is Darrell’s: “I was intrigued by the male generation - then men were always in debt and spent money on things they couldn’t afford.
The different generations of the Darrell family have dealt with this by marrying rich or old virgins - I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who loved their heirs' heads."
With the end of his stay at the castle, he's looking for Rhodes for other adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week strike in the Finnish wilderness, where he was inspired by his next book on Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the beginning of the 20th century, which was absorbed by nature.
But it's a special place for Scotney.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I said to myself, 'Now to get the hell back in real life'."
Washington changes the conditions for granting a green card
Media has released President Donald Trump's words on the new US immigration plan, in which the green card will be changed as well.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to fall by 50,000 per year as a result of stricter rules on the granting of temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the President.
The draft law will be submitted to Congress soon.
“This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and we will achieve this by changing the rules for issuing green cards to residents of other countries.
The law limits the number of immigrants and replaces current schemes.
The new application process will give priority to English speaking applicants, who are fuelled by funding and demonstrate the skills that will benefit our country," said Trump, quoted by the media.
Sex robots are on the rise - we should be careful
Just when it seemed that 2017 could not be more bizarre, a report on the technological development of sexual robots appeared on the Internet.
Yes.
Sex robots are currently really popular.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sexual robots within the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and cofounder of the FRR Noel Sharkey, it is necessary to look seriously at the rise of sexual robots.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of nipples and the appearance of nails robot.
"People are drawing on them, but sales are growing and we need to be prepared to see them more and more often," Sharkey said on the occasion of the publication of the report.
Modern sexual aids change from inflatable masters to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm - of course, artificial intelligence that mimics human behavior.
The user can “correct” the robot to its image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the appearance and color of the nails.
Of course, the fact that many robots have their own “personality” to shame the Stepford Lady is very disturbing.
Modern inflatable dolls have evolved into a robotic woman with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set its alternate woman a variety of characteristics, including shyness.
And then there's a sex robot woman, Roxxxy Gold, of True Companion, who is supplied with pre-programmed personalities, including "frigid Farrah", which is characterized by a shy nature and a "wild Wendy" with a "virgin" character.
"The Roxxxy Gold personality is set to suit your personality to the maximum extent possible," says True Companion's website.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
She can be tired, talkative, or “in the mood. ”
The rise of sexual robots is alarming for a number of reasons - among which there is no substitute for real human relationships. More disturbing are women's inferior characteristics and violent hints - e.g. frigid (read resisting) Farrah.
True Companion likens Roxxxy to a male vibrator on its website.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't she have a man named Roxxxy?" it says on the page.
However, sexual robots are not just fetishes or sex aids.
Their creation and almost perfect sophysicism point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - a shift from ideal or sexual equality towards desire for sublime sex with an optional adjective.
Most men, of course, do not buy a robot woman, and while the FRR is talking about their growing popularity, sexual robots are still on the brink of interest to the general public.
However, this extreme interest can become a mirror of the modern - day setting.
And most people aren't weird or violent until they have an excuse to go free market.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women around the world are gaining their rights and in the White House, the president is sitting at the woman's address, who is often very disgruntled.
The most terrifying aspect of the series The story of the servant is not what we see - the hanged bodies and the scratched eyes, rather than the reality of these visions.
The servant’s book - based introduction represents a step in the right direction, but at present it seems to be a small step.
Sexual robots are to be as much like real women as possible (even porn actresses).
Their creators design them so that they are pleasant to touch and act at first sight as a real woman.
But when it comes to their “personality, ” a robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no job or history, anything that would cause their independence or disrupt their devotion to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
Says the 21st century, maids.
The NBA star on the green arm.
Curry's fighting in California for a cut.
The star basketball player Stephen Curry did not lose his first shot in the premiere between professional golfers.
Double award holder for the most useful NBA players played at the Ellie Mae Classic Lower Series Web.com Tour in California's Hayward first round for 74 rounds and will fight for a cut.
The Golden State player, who won the second post with Warriors in the NBA this season, began very nervously and first set off in a drink holder in a golf cart parked near Fairway.
Even then he wasn't as accurate as under a basketball basket, yet he left a dozen professionals behind with a score of four wounds over a pair.
"It wasn't the perfect way to start, to have to call the referee right after the first launch, but then it sat down a little," Curry said with the huge trauma that fell on him.
It was very nervous, to blow up the first morning of the tournament, but it was all I could hope for.
"If you told me I'd play 74 in the first round, I'd take it right away," he added.
If Curry manages to struggle with a feeling that is likely to be determined two shots below the pair, he becomes the first representative of another sport to do so on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I've gotten rid of the drama, I think it's going to be," said the enthusiastic golfer, who has already played the tournaments of celebrities and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
He starts his first tournament in Hayward, which falls under PGA.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic, he received a sponsorship exception and maintained amateur status.
Series Web.com Tour is one category under elite PGA Tour.
Trump's great victory?
Against this, Mitt Romney is a healthy mind
Trump’s era is an unmistakable feature of political divisions that divide American voters and microscales that also disrupt entire families.
During Christmas and Thanksgiving, it was in the American newspaper to consult with relatives who voted for Trump.
Apparently, we're just waiting for him to allow us nerves.
Less attention, however, is paid to Trump’s ability to keep his family steady.
I'm talking about it because my cousin, a poet and a left-wing fan, visited me this week in New York City, who had been paying for a long time for a Republican idiot in Chicago.
She reminded me that sequentialness in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, suddenly, the whole family - including all the Republican siblings with whom she has fought about politics for many years - on one wave.
At dinner at the family table, it's a good thing; but I find it a significant risk in the wider context.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all out of the right.
If we're talking about "normalization" and Trump, we point to the terrifying possibility that his jesters may lose their attractiveness one day.
There is, however, an even worse long-term scenario in which Trump “normalises” the right-wing republicans, who, defying its standards, will suddenly be the embodiment of what can be called rational.
In these days, with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitta Romney and his version of crazy behavior - a dog on the roof of the car, a 14% income tax (at least we had an awareness of his tax admission) - of which both examples appear to be very slight overlaps compared to Trump.
After Trump's departure, it will be sufficient for the subsequent Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be a huge improvement.
We used to visit my cousin and we took the children to Central Park for the biggest bike that runs the New York Park department - for your three dollars you won't find a better use if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the middle cylinder is covered with glass - clowns and animals are filmed and in horror of looking at their own shoulders - quite a gloomy view and tinkling music is a reminder of public transport.
Many clichés will soon get tired: the view from the tall buildings, the panorama is watching, instead of the atmosphere breathing on you and the reality of the city is not getting your ideas.
Thirty-five years later, I still did not get over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not actually Swiss cheese - not counting the Ye Old Swiss Cottage theme pub - but the London metro station.
The Central Park bike, however, has a remarkable magical experience, to the extent that two two two-year-olds, as well as two mature women, will enjoy it.
If I could evaluate the colt, he'd deserve the maximum points, but no one's asking.
This week, I experienced a similar experience in the store when I was asked to evaluate my “experience” on a scale from one to five when I paid a credit card.
It's the same at the coffee shop on the corner of my street, except I can throw 15% tips on something I'm gonna buy behind the counter.
Not only is it slowing down otherwise fast sales, but the waitress is so forced to rub in the chain of buyers if it is not necessary.
The woman at the store apologized with a smile when I reluctantly valued my credit card transfer with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from the prison to the hospital for chest pain
This is the second time that Pistorius had to be taken to the hospital.
Last year he was treated for cuts in his wrist, which, according to the prison statement, caused himself a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal against the original murder conviction.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 several gunshot wounds through his bathroom closet door in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he was mistaken about her as a thief.
The plaintiffs announced their intention to appeal again, this time against the six-year penalty of Pistorius, which, according to their words, is too mild.
National Prosecting Authority stated that it refers to the South African Supreme Court and the trial will take place this year.
If successful, Pistorius will be threatened with a sentence of up to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, she gave birth to a young girl in captivity to a foster panda who mated in the wilderness.
The Panda rescue program is a huge success.
The center is trying to expand the genofond of the panda held in captivity.
An employee of the centre of Chang C-chung told the agency New China that Panda farming is at great risk from a kinship cross.
In captivity, only 471 pandas lived at the end of last year.
In the wild, only two thousand of them survive.
Trying to let captured pandas mate with those savages be such a first step toward helping to protect the panda.
The 15-year-old Cchao-chao was released in the natural reservation at the beginning of the Panda mating period on 11 March.
Thanks to the tracking device on the neck, scientists could observe her every move.
She met her chosen friend Cchao-cchao 12 days later.
Sexual intercourse with the male panda lasted a minute and a half and was successful.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, for male pandas are not considered to be the most successful lovers of the animal empire.
Males miscalculate the time when a female is ready, and they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
Young people were born healthy and, even though Chao-chao had a special appetite during pregnancy, it weighed 216 grams.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in the territory of Greece for illegal camping, the statement quoted bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, was detained by the police in the morning.
They were all released the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated for bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules of free camping and impose strict fines on anyone caught in a place where no camping is allowed.
Checks will take place in the whole season.
The Ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Spielková is in the 50th place after the first round of British Open.
Golfist Klara Spilková marks after the first round Major British Open in 50th place.
The court at Kingsbarns in Scotland bypassed the score one punch under the pair when she played three Birdies and twice the bogey.
A 20-year-old Czech player has the hope that she will feel the first time on a famous major.
Entering the grant of $3.25 million was best won by the American star Michelle Wieová, who won the first round in the 64-round record, eight under the pair.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are withdrawing millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has temporarily closed 180 poultry crops because of the incident.
According to Reuters, the Netherlands Food Safety Supervisor has announced that he is investigating 20 per cent of all Dutch poultry, which means that 80 per cent of eggs on the market are unnecessary.
The Authority stressed that the risk represents only a limited number of egg types identifiable according to specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and does not pose a risk to adults, but it is a potential threat to children.
Czech-speaking SVS Petr Majer reported that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities have also joined the closing of breeding, had not recently been imported to the Czech Republic.
However, the veterinarians will take samples of eggs and chicken meat from Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, in which problem labels of insecticide appeared.
According to the veterinary administration in the Czech market, eggs from Belgium were the last in April and eggs from the Netherlands in May.
Chicken meat from Belgium appeared last in June in the Czech Republic.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that forms part of fleas, lice and ticks.
However, animals whose meat is consumed by humans must not be served.
World Health Organization WHO considers the preparation to be slightly toxic.
His high doses lead to feelings of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I'm gonna miss her, she's gonna say "Golman Sedlaček" and she's looking for an engagement.
I'd still like to catch ten years.
"Maybe I'll go back there one day," smiled a 27-year-old Seat who could start the season in the winter jersey.
Depends on whether he gets involved in the start of the new year.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I were to evaluate it like I was in school, three times.
The first year I didn't catch too much, I had an experienced golfer in front of me.
I learned.
The next year, I started catching up.
Before season three, I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought a new football player with whom I was changing again.
Last year, I assumed I'd catch you all the time.
But during the initial ten games, we won only five points, so the coaches started to spin.
He's already caught my colleague more at the end.
But that's how you do it.
They wanted to play it for next season.
What was life like in Riza?
Beautiful.
It's little Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss her.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, we're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How demanding is KHL for goalkeepers?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Slavan who must change their game style against them.
Skill's on the other side, so you have to replace it.
That means playing back more, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem in the width of the playground.
The difference is, the Russians want to play in the empty.
Less shooting, and even though they have a busy goal ahead of them, they prefer to record it.
There's only more shooting in the Czech Republic.
Didn't travel problem cause you to move over seven time zones?
If a person doesn't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is usually done by playing maybe four games outside and then you have two days off.
How do Lotus feel about their KHL club anyway?
As a national team.
All of Latvia is watching hockey, along with basketball is a national sport.
Everybody's a fan.
Even though it didn't work out, there were a lot of people.
Did Dinama’s influence in KHL help Latvia in this year’s World Cup almost reach the quarterfinals?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And since the same time, their results at the world championship have started going up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi they fell in the quarterfinals with Canada just 1:2.
That was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they've reached a higher level.
More and more lottery players are still heading for Czech extraliga.
In Zlín, Roberts Bukarts took over and before the contract was signed, Ralphs Freibers.
Why is it that so many come here?
They're not any of the scorers, they're really good.
These teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Lottysi among them.
It's natural.
KHL's been starting in three weeks.
Why are you still single?
At the beginning of February, I knew I wouldn't go on with Riz.
That's when we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because we didn't have a budget for the goalkeeper, we didn't make a deal.
Then it was a classic.
We had fun with different teams, but in the finals, they decided for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlín and I'll be waiting for something to show up.
Aren't you nervous about that?
That was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I am at home for a while.
I've caught something in KHL, so I'll take it differently.
The only question is when and where I sign.
How real is the possibility that you will start a new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens in a month, where they'll be thrown out.
All I can do now is wait for the agent to make a deal.
Do you prefer a competition?
The past season wasn't the kind of season I could choose.
So I'm waiting on the phone.
The government's flight is continuing.
In January of this year, I wrote in an article With the care of the proper landlord? I also wrote about the camp in Lettech near Orlík.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I will allow the difficult passage of the article to be recalled.
The camp in Letha has been under discussion for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what is going on, it will probably be best if they look at, for example, the official site of cultural monuments Pietna place leta.
There, in the opening of the historical account, they learn that the camp stood two kilometres east of the village of Leta, since 8th of 1940 serving as a labor camp, from 1.1. 1942 he was a collecting camp, and from 2.8. 1942 he became a gypsy camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including non-human conditions, until March 1943, when the first prisoners of the air were included in the secular transport.
On 4.5.1943, 370 people were transported to the extermination camp.
A total of 420.
A very sad history of the immense misery of human beings that caused them to be human again and perverted ideology.
There is no dispute that it is necessary to keep these events in mind.
There is no dispute that this reminder should take place at the memorial site of the suffering experienced by these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
For socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten, and in the 1970 ’ s, a ferret was built on part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was discovered by chance in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a monument was discovered in Lettech.
In the mid - 1990 ’ s, the government promised to repurchase and break the vreature, but it has not yet happened.
In 1998, the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the United Nations Committee on Human Rights of the Czech Republic called on the Czech Republic to close the ferret.
So few facts about the postwar fate of the camp.
During the fall of last year, the government approved a pig buying-in and decided to draw up an expert assessment to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy the pork.
According to Minister of Herman's Culture "there are some numbers, but I'd probably dream of going public with them."
Let's see what the expert report says.
According to some unofficial estimates, the price can amount to hundreds of millions, others say it can reach up to a billion.
Either way, it won't be a cheap thing.
At the same time, only a few hundred meters from the former camp is a monument, to which the state invested nearly ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the United Nations Human Rights Committee funded the whole transaction beautifully, which is probably not a threat, I think it would be the same thing to throw away money.
Doesn't the government have a different priority?
A monument, a dignified drinking place, stands the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of an ongoing tragedy and anyone who wants to, can worship the memory of the suffering and murdered here.
I see no reason to change that!
Let's leave it the way it is, and let's keep the drinking place as careful as possible.
A responsible person, in this case the Government of the Czech Republic, should deal with the care of the proper owner, also with the money of taxpayers.
At least with someone like you in your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and Vice-President of the Government is not the whole government.
But I still see from the point of view of the above-mentioned fact the password of the leader of the ANO movement only as an empty pre-election narrative.
I went to see the place this May.
Very decent driveway, prepared parking space, replicas of wooden camp buildings.
In one exposure, in the second integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheatre with the possibility of sitting and looking at its own spot, which is made of stones located in a mild slope.
Lots of flowers and pretzels.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place as they fit and belong.
Currently, archaeological research is taking place at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether it would not be possible, for example, to book some of the discovered foundations and, in an appropriate manner, at least visually accessible.
In this direction, he could put his efforts on hold by the Minister of Culture, Daniel Herman.
If he manages to buy a bribe for state money in the government, it will only be another unfortunate step in his already problematic role as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolates can relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IDD)
For your digestive system, red meat and milk products can be a nightmare.
However, a new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
An incurable disease affecting up to 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 patients in the United Kingdom causes abdominal pain and bleeding diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are normally reminded not to eat meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms. However, researchers at the University of Washington found that essential Triptophan amino acid contained in the protein helps to create immune cells that support bowel resistance.
The head of the study, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that the immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the removal of harmful microbes from the food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that support tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
As the bowls lean on the side of the inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease may occur.
As part of the research, scientists have discovered the presence of immune cells supporting the body tolerance in the stomach with specific bacteria.
This bacteria requires the presence of Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins to form cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We found a connection between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuterium - which is a common part of the intestinal microbiome and the development of cells that support the body’s tolerance.
The more tryptophan mice had in their diet, the more they had these immune cells."
At the same time, he suggested that if it turns out that the same applies to humans, then a combination of L. reuterium and triptophan-rich diets would help develop a more tolerant and less inflammatory bowel environment.
Postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas in a study of some kind of immune cells supporting the body tolerance found that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mouse-bred cells lacked.
It derived from the fact that one group of mice has different intestinal microbioms - a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mouse has been tested by the DNA sequence method and researchers have found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells that lacked the second group of mice.
The mice that were kept in the sterile environment and they lacked intestinal microbiom - they didn't develop this kind of immune cell - they injected L. reuterium bacteria - and they created immune cells.
In order to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers developed L. reuters in the fluid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - without the bacteria - the undeveloped immune cells that were kept in isolation.
Immunity cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After removing the active substance from the fluid, it was shown to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-octic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophan in the mouse diet, the number of these cells increased by 50 percent.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance cells as mice, and most of us keep L. reuterium bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether by-products of Tryptophan from L. reuterium cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but genetic defects associated with Tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Every one of us should probably try to develop these cells because they control the inflammation of the internal surface of the gut.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuterium bacteria may increase the population of cells."
José Mourinho considers the signing of the contract with Nemania Matić and his transfer to Manchester United as “genial”
Manchester United won his team "génia" in the form of Germany Matice - at least that's what José Mourinho thinks after the publisher debuted in the mid-term match against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed a contract of £40 million, entered the first win of 2-1 in Dublin - the last pre-season match in front of the UEFA Superpark, where the United States will meet on Tuesday with Real Madrid - and joins in his role as a backer alongside Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not take part in the team's pre-season Asian tour, Matić did not have the form and only took 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinha, requires another Premier League season to work on before the start of the season.
"It takes time, but it is experienced, intelligent and has brilliant thinking - it thinks in football," Mourin said.
"We will help him to get in shape as soon as possible."
Like Mattić, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romel Lukak also played the first match for Aviva Stadium and Mourinho, slowly forming their 11th for the next season.
An independent source this week announced that Mourinho still wants to sign a contract with three other players, but insists that the club has done a "fiantistic job" and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"Thank the club for helping me get three out of four players," he added.
"Four out of four would please me more, but I admit they made the maximum for me."
Lifetime challenge to the king of chicken hides and skins of the Torus.
He wants to learn from Pohlreich!
The multi-pronged picture began to rise as a result of a new show on TV Prima Zdeněk Academy.
The peacock immediately seized the chance.
"Dear Zdenek, I would like to apply to this in your cooking academy, because, my hand to the heart, I think I can learn a lot from you," he called in a video on the social network.
And since the two of them have been spying on each other for years, the ice hasn't forgotten to tease him this time.
"In return, I can teach you to eat from dietary chicken meat, American cucumbers, or to invite you to the water and show you why it's fried cheese," Hrushka said.
He's really serious about his participation in Pohlreich's new show.
It's time to move up and learn from the master.
"The question is what the boss said to Lightning.
But he didn't say a word because he filmed new parts of his next show. Yes, boss!
To attend Hrushka in the culinary academy only reacted to prima by taking the whole matter as his personal activity outside of television.
In December 2004 Hrushka Pohlreich planted his first cook.
In a few days, over 300,000 pieces were sold to her!
A new show presented by Prime at a press conference yesterday on the autumn broadcast schedule is an unfalse cooking school.
The deaf are selected from a number of audiences, and in twelve parts they are introduced to 12 cooking techniques.
In the last part of his show The boss is cooking in November 2014 Zdeněk on the back of his trick he had a crossed pear.
If he had my face, I'd laugh a lot.
"I'll just smile over the peas - the pea is healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," the ice responded.
He thinks of ice culinary art.
"Food according to Lady Hrushka doesn't come into the house, because I'm not going to let go of the gastropunk at home," the boss has a clear idea.
I really appreciate Pohlreich, even if he thinks I'm making honey chicken.
On my show, however, his recipes will certainly not appear," Hrushka did not forgive himself.
He's an asshole!
He's not a cook for me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomic analfabet or idiot," said Pohlreich about Hrushkov in one lecture.
"I'm not twenty years old to be able to shake hands with them, but I don't solve them that much anymore," said Hrusek, in his account of the insults expressed.
British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock the car and house by waving
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip put into the body. A simple hand-strapping can unlock the door from the house and offices and even start the car.
The 30-year-old Steven Northam has had a small chip implanted between the thumb and the index finger and currently offers the same service through its BioTeq company to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology.
Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, oversees the procedure for implanting and following treatment procedures.
Technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted to dogs and cats and the whole procedure lasts 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers a door and car exchange service compatible with a microchip. The price of one castle is £300.
The married father of one child lets the technology integrate into his home and his car brand BMW Z4, which starts with a simple handshake.
The White House Requisition cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
The decision of the White House to fly a Navy helicopter to South Lawn at the occasion of the celebration of the American manufacturing industry, which took place last month, came to the attention of the Navy's logs issued by Time for a week of $24,000.
Green White helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One, in the presence of the president on board, was the highlight of the programme from July 17 in the White House, which was a show of American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several senior White House officials were watching a show of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter from Connecticut was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a viscous lift from Mississippi.
Military officer White House issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, and requested the presence of a helicopter less than 36 hours before landing on South Lawn in the context of a “immortal” event, listed the logs of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - the units responsible for managing the helicopter.
"I wanted to make sure you were aware of such a significant event," Commander HMX-1 wrote to his superior in an e-mail to his superior, Deputy Navy Commander for Aviation the day before the start of the event.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn on July 17th at approximately 7:00 p.m. on the occasion of the show, the start of which is scheduled for 15:00 p.m. and will remain in place until the whole place was completely cleared, which was scheduled for between 6 p.m. and 21:00 p.m.
The e-mail further stated that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a replacement crew will be sent for return flight due to the Working Time Regulation.
The original crew stayed on the scene that night with the helicopter and also with them a unit of security personnel.
From the records - obtained by the Time week - it was not clear if the second crew was eventually sent.
The Hatch Act prohibits civil servants from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible violations of this Regulation.
"We wondered if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was all right," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you're being blocked," the deputy commander wrote.
This show “Made in America” was marked by the White House as an official event and the Hatch Act would not therefore apply to it.
But even official events have political subtexts.
In his participation in the event, the President promoted a health reform that was going through the Senate, and he spoke of an attempt to maintain the government regulation.
The use of air vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
The presidents use them on their journeys.
However, their presence for purely presentational reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after the presidential plane went into the background during his first meeting in the Melbourne campaign in Florida. His Twitter account is covered by complaints about the use of the presidential plane to his predecessor.
"The White House is pleased with the "Made in America" show, which presented products from all 50 states producing American materials," said US Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in Washington and South Lawn and train possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump participated in the G-20 summit in early July in Germany, HMX-1 carried out 58 training landings at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America show was part of the current training of the crew, said state official.
On the same day, a helicopter unit flew in under “non-presidential support missions” for another eleven hours.
The White House stated that no more props were paid from taxpayers' money.
The speaker Sikorsky said that the company was not in any way interested in the talks on the landing of a helicopter on South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep records of the budget for presidential flights and the exact cost of the tour is difficult to determine, according to the Navy's statement.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hourly price for fiscal year 2017 is paid for DoD expenses for VH-3D $24,380 per flight hour.
Records of the unit specify time 30 minutes from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of helicopters are well below that amount.
"It is very misleading to specify the costs of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement of expenses," Walters said.
‘These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs, which are included in annual costs.’
According to the 2015 RAND study, the compensation for the DDs does not cover staff costs, but includes the cost of fuel, maintenance and contractual costs.
The then White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of helicopters for the purpose of the show.
"The idea of a show that takes place this week is to present products produced in the US," Spicer said.
"I am aware that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the defence of our state and that they provide work for hundreds, if not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, we're proud of the helicopter and other military facilities in which an innumerable number of American citizens are involved.
This is a fact to be reminded of."
It is not clear if Trump was also looking at the helicopter while on South Lawn. It can be said that he was sitting behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back in the White House Trump addressed Sikorsky’s representative and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I own three myself."
A young woman tied up in the swamp at Mácho's lake, and the police were getting in love with her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday around 2:00 in the morning.
But instead of bathing, she was trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to ask for police help on her cell phone, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"For that reason the police soon lost contact with her," said police spokesman Ivana Baláková.
Several police patrols went to a site that she described, but it was not easy to find a young woman.
"Some of the officers had to wade through the Raccos' wetlands hundreds of metres before they felt the solid ground again," Baláková approached.
And she was similarly missing.
The officers were focused on the direction in which her call for help was based.
"To avoid at least this connection, they agreed with her that she would count out loud," the speaker said.
Police officers found a woman in the Borný area at three o'clock in the swamps.
She was on the brink of physical and mental forces and showed signs of dehydration.
That's why the invited ambulance took her to the Czecholip hospital.
The Grandad's connection to Stan?
The bride is asked to become a saleswoman.
That's a little ironic.
His web project is looking for meslusno.cz as if billionaire voters were basically saying that STAN suffers from the deficit of decent people.
And he also argued that a politically unrelated group rather than less-known mayors and independents, in fact, has no national programme for the House elections.
Her election candidate simply after talking to Grandpa becomes a decent person, no matter what political opinion he has.
That's how he used to start Vít Barta, and it didn't work out very well.
In addition, Grandpa breaks even the favorite argument of Chief STAN that the greatest value of the movement is the political examination and the experience of the mayor, traditionally the most popular of politicians, and according to surveys.
They can easily alter the quickly collected unknown personalities.
The total separation with the human race, after which Stan changed the logo and slogan, Gadzík also explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity on human candidates.
But if STAN suspected only a few of them then, after Grandpa arrived, the game of identity is over.
Not only did Gazdík long define himself against ANO Andrej Babiš, but the grandfather, who publicly praises Babiš, said: "My goal is to make the movement ANO, then the Starosta movement gained 20 per cent in the coming elections."
Let's hope he hasn't made a mistake.
Grandpa's a successful businessman, and a billionaire is definitely not a coincidence.
Often, politics is spoken of like Babish, but unlike him, I will not be my own political mark.
STAN has for some time been reminiscing reality show rather than a real political party and Grandpa's hand as if the bride wanted to make more of a sales girl.
STAN went with TOP 09 for a while, then with the people, and now he's looking for decent people to change.
Let's hope someone gets back to you.
Police dogs trained in the Bridge to fly a helicopter
Dogs specializing in the search for explosives and search dogs today practiced by Lake Most by helicopter.
The police dog must not be anxious and be afraid of flying, said the chief of police quinologists of the Ústecká Region Petr Tomášek.
Police dog training takes about two years.
At the Bridge, they practiced both adult dog training and those who are only undergoing training.
In addition to the standard training that they were supposed to discover in the vicinity of the lake sharp samples of explosives and search for the lost dummy, all 12 animals had to enter the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test dogs in the helicopter.
So that as soon as the helicopter reaches, the dog can go to work so that he doesn't have a problem with the helicopter's journey.
"So far the helicopter, the dog goes and immediately seeks," Tomášek said.
A dog that is restless or on the way by helicopter is unable to start working immediately is excluded from training.
"Most of the time, they leave them in the garden for example," Tomášek added.
Police have 76 dogs with different specializations in the Ústecká region.
The German sheep dominate, but also the Belgian sheep come.
The book has been looking after him since the puppy.
"He raises him himself, prepares him for the service that the dog will do for us," said Tomášek.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary tests which may reveal any health handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and unwary, it shall make up the first exam in 20 months.
"It takes about two and a half to three years for a sharp hit," Tomášek added.
The length of police service depends on the health status of the dog.
Most of them serve within eight to ten years.
And most of them live with their followers.
Trailer at 3rd season Narcos: Pablo Escobar is out of the game and Cali Cartel becomes the midpoint of a hit series of Netflix
Despite the end of the second season of Narcos, when Pablo Escobar's killer was discovered, the Netflix series is far from over.
The confirmation by the streaming service was already waiting for the third and fourth seasons - the first one already named was the first trailer and the other negative figures.
In the third season, the DEA focuses on the richest drug cartel in the world: Cali Cartel.
Under the direction of the four influential godfathers, they operate “as a society from the Fortune 500 ladder, ” only with the difference that they are increasing their violent actions and withdrawing more government agents.
Gilberto Rodriguez Oreyuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Oreyuela (Francesco Denis) plays the brain of operations, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of connecting to Mexico and Chepe Santacruz London (Pepe Rapazote) is in charge of New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a figure recruiting American and Colombian drug rights enforcers.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will take place on September 1st.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
Elections may be credible only if all members of society, including women, participate in them, and are listed at the centre of the UN representative in Afghanistan.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN Assistance Mission, said that elections to local representatives were attended by hundreds of women, three women applied for the post of Vice President and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters were women.
‘The role of women cannot be overlooked,’ he stated in his midterm statement.
Elections may be fully representative and credible only if women are involved, as well as all related processes that relate to the elections.
The local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on 5 April.
The Taliban has issued several threats against the electoral process, which moves international action to a secondary level.
In this year's elections, for the first time, one democratically elected government is handing over its power peacefully to the following government.
Haysom said that the strong role of women will strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission stated that out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million women were elected.
The unique brewery is brewing beer again.
For a good beer in a re-animated brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners returned a few years ago to the life of a brewery in Lobču u Mšen.
The brewery, mentioned for the first time already in 1586, has a Renaissance core and in the nineteenth century it was converted into a parochial operation.
It was followed by years of bloom, when the brewery was mostly known for dark beer.
Unfortunately, production was stopped during World War II and the brewery was born in 1984.
Since then, they've served the building of a state ship.
The ruin was done by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and dismantled on building material.
In 2007, however, she brightened new hopes in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouzov.
They started repairing buildings with maximum respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They carefully devoted themselves to the study of archive materials, trying to preserve original materials and building elements.
The brewery is the same as it was in the nineteenth century when its golden age began.
Their work was appreciated by the declaration of a brewery for cultural monuments by the Ministry of Culture and the construction became part of the European pathways of industrial heritage.
In 2015 they also celebrated the tradition of brewing.
To taste a great lobby beer in the picturesque landscape of Kokořínska, visit the bench in the brewery area.
When brewing beer here, they use coconut water springing in a protected landscape area, ice cream from lobbying fields, and greek hop.
You taste a traditional light bed, but also dark beers and specials.
And don't miss a tour of the brewery on Saturday and Sunday at noon and at half.
The biggest artillery fortress of Czechoslovakia?
One of the greatest fortresses of his type on a global scale?
Thus, the unique building was to be the fortress Stachelberg between Trutnov and Žacler, on the top of the terrain ridge above the village of Babí.
Originally, it was to be made up of up to 12 bunkers connected by a vast underground subterranean.
Here was supposed to be headquarters, casinos, ammo warehouses, materials, power plant, machinery station and hospital.
But the building ended the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, a single powerful iron concrete bunker was built and underground spaces were dismantled.
Thanks to the enthusiasts of the Stachelberg, who began to reconstruct the unique building in the early 1990s, you can look here as well.
The underground is now 75 percent open!
In addition to the T-S 73 infantry cabin with exposure and underground, the site is also equipped with a light sealing facility, and two built infantry bolts, trenches and a science trail Fortified Trutnovsko.
Refreshments, cosy altanaics and breathtaking views of the landscape guaranteed!
This unique and wonderful Czech building was listed next to such monuments as the Great Wall of China, the Traian port of Rome or the palace of Assyria in Nineveh and Nimrudu.
Klášter Chotěšov originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today is primarily made up of a powerful four-wing building of a convent over a beautiful garden.
The list he got on, but unfortunately, belongs to unique buildings that are threatened with extinction.
But the enthusiasts don't want to give up, and there's a lot of events going on in support of the monastery.
One of them is another year's Evening for the Monastery Chotěšov this Saturday of August, where they will perform. Vladimír Mišík, Ivan Hlas, you will see a sharmish performance and you will look at the places of beautiful extensive buildings that are usually unavailable.
But you're going to enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.

Let yourself be convinced in Brno.
The 14th KELT & WORLD MUSIC festival is held on Saturday fifth in Veveří Castle.
In addition to great music you will see the construction of the Celtic village, you will try the Celtic way of life including crafts, games for children and adults, fortune-telling, magic or ritual painting on the body.
There will be no lack of La Quadrilla with Irish and Scottish dances, drum jamming, a game of rainbows and amazing fire surprises in Carpe Noct.
How does Moravia taste?
The seventh year of famous gastrofestival How to taste Moravian Silesia takes place on Saturday August 5th, 2017 in the area of the Karlovy Studánka mountain baths.
Cooking chef Miroslav Kalina, taste culinary specialties and regional food, enjoy musical and dance performances, rich program for children such as creative workshops, theatre, jumping castle, Smurf competition and, of course, a number of competitions.
Know the plant by one click.
The new free app of Pl@ntNet will help herbarians and ordinary plant lovers.
If they're interested in what plant they just ran into on a walk, these applications will give them advice.
All they're gonna have to do is take a picture of the plant, and the application itself knows what kind it is.
The new application, available for iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the Centre for Ethical and Environmental Education CEEV in Bratislava Mountain Park in the framework of the Secret Life of the City project.
Students from 50 Czech and Slovak schools also participated in the project, who took photos and added plants from their surroundings with teachers to the application database.
The newly created French application is free to download on the site Secret life of the city.
The main aim of the French programmers was to make as many people as possible contribute to the application with their images, thereby increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
"Until the children who keep the tablet or cell phone in their hand can go to the forest," said project coordinator Ivana Poláčková.
On the basis of sufficient quality photos of flower, leaf or plant fruit, the application can recognize its name within a few seconds, which will then be assigned under the photograph in Czech as well as in Slovenian.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovenian and Czech into the project Secret Life of the City.
It is therefore welcome for users to contribute to the application by taking a picture of the plant, which is not yet available in the database.
"Francuzzi will evaluate if it's profitable, and then add it to the database," Poláčková informed.
GMB concerns about investing in the McVitie's factory in Glasgow
Committees require insurance from managers of McVitie's cookies manufacturer for the long-term production obligation at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish Trade Union GMB stated that the company was currently silent about any investment in the Tollcross factory.
The factory employs more than 500 employees who manufacture also Hobnob and Rich Tea cookies.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, stated that she had invested more than 5 million pounds in the whole area over the previous few years.
She added that employees and union representatives would be “between the first informed” in the event of changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the construction company, the Scottish GMBs expressed their concern that McVitie's will not "get his promises to finance and modernise production lines".
GMB’s main organizer Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we did not get clear answers from the construction manager regarding the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very disturbing for our members.
There have been generations of families and employees working here mostly from the local community and the Glasgow area, where work in this factory represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social exclusion.
From the point of view of work, wages and benefits - and despite the outlook on Brexit, rising living costs and falling slow production - the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous producer such as McVitie's."
The speaker told Pladis: “The incumbent Tollcross received a letter from the GMB only yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible because we appreciate the continuing commitment to employees and union representatives.
Regular meetings with GMB employees and representatives at Tollcross took place two months ago and many problems were openly discussed at this meeting.
We talked to the employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we value our operation on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested 5 million pounds in the Tollcross area, especially in production lines and operation efficiency.
We very much appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and the localities here and, in the event of any changes in operation, the factory here will immediately be informed by the employees and representatives of the trade unions."
Warned PSG Barcelona of Neymara's move three years ago?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow in his attempt to get Neymara on his side after she made £189 million, i.e. the amount needed to redeem Neymara from the contract, but warned this French team of Barcelona of its record raid three years ago?
This sensational step developed the waters of summer passes. Club Ligue 1 is ready to overcome more than twice the previous record amount for Paula Pogby’s transfer to Manchester United, which paid him £89 million in last season.
After confirmation and completion of the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and at the same time the best paid professional athlete in the world - after tax, the PSG team will collect over £500,000 per week.
Barcelona is outraged by the way Neymar got out of his contract, despite the fact that the confidential source confirmed that the club had always tried to satisfy Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
However, was the football world reminded of this fact three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City in 2014 expressed its interest in Blaise Matudid, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all the clubs that should be interested in converting one of the best PSG players.
"I'm not afraid because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we will certainly address one of their players," Al-Khelaif said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed a reasonable line when she expressed interest in the PSG publisher Marc Verratti during the summer.
PSG made it clear in the sense that under no circumstances would allow the Italian representative to leave. It is therefore possible that Barcelona, now with Neymara leaving, will swallow a bitter pill for its daring actions.
Who's gonna explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have widely understood rules?
Donald Trump nodded for anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Madura.
And a day earlier, Trump wrote that China is not doing anything with North Korea's threat and that it will not go on like this.
And that's what the idea of sanctions is like a shoe straw.
You can't throw those things in one bag.
Madur's Venezuela has indeed set out on its way to the dictatorship, or totality.
China just doesn't behave as the American president wishes.
Russia is a chapter for itself.
But if anyone wanted to sum it all up so that even a common voter, an American, European or otherwise, understood what it was and what system of rules was based on sanctions policy, it would be almost impossible to do so.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump is only appealing to what President Obama has already set up, only to that effect.
Then why all the fuss?
Last year, Europe was afraid that if Trump won the US elections, we would hug Putin and cancel the sanctions.
It's a terrible idea.
But in practice, it's the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are not released, but tightened.
But Europe is even more afraid.
German Minister Zypries says Trump's sanctions violate international law.
Like the kosher are only sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
However, they are neither kosher nor anti-Russian EU sanctions.
The Head of the European Commission Juncker laments that Trump’s sanctions threaten the EU’s energy security.
Like they're supposed to use sanctions just so weak that they don't threaten anyone?
The usual voter's on the run.
For three years he heard that the fate of the anti-Russian sanctions depended solely on the fulfilment of the Minsk peace agreements in Ukraine.
It is now known that this is an EU energy security issue.
The wolf's snooping and spreading.
Russia is being penalized for getting too fitted to where it doesn't belong.
China is thinned by the fact that it is not enough.
The Venezuelan President is being punished for building a dictatorship within his country's borders.
All these punishments, or only considerations, have their rationality.
But does anyone see the system, the rules or the rules?
Andrej Babish: I am not considering working with Okamura.
Andrej Babish married, crosses the Republic with his visionary book, and completes the election program.
In addition to the Pardubice region, all candidates have already completed.
In his words, he did not significantly interfere with them.
He even agreed to the leadership of the Heitman and Shadow Minister of Education ANO Ivo Vondarak.
"If he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a Member or a Heitman," Babish confirmed his earlier opinion.
A lot of representatives and national politicians are angry about the fact that the election of mayors and prime ministers should run the municipalities and cities alone, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we elect a president directly, and I am convinced that we should also elect mayors and prime ministers.
In my book, I'm not talking about disrupting representatives, they could be there.
The question is, how many will there be?
When I present your book what I will dream about, when I accidentally sleep, I heard on my own ears that you were talking about cancelling the representatives.
I don't remember.
I was talking about a direct election and a reduction in the number of representatives.
New York, with nine million inhabitants, has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the prime minister says she doesn't build much projects, but she doesn't have the power to do it.
The same is true of the government that was ruled by only two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
I'm not saying they did it right.
But the Prime Minister is not in charge, he's just a moderator of the debate.
It can't work that way.
Is that why you want to use the majority system?
He'd be perfect, but it's hard to get through.
All we have in the program is a change in the one-wheeled election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a cohesive mandate of ministers and the amendment of the Rules of Procedure of the House in order to prevent unnecessary exhibitions of Members, who are to work mainly in committees and committees, from displaying themselves at meetings of the House.
It is definitely not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are afraid of.
That as a dictator you will rule the government, control the House with 101 Members, cancel the provinces and the Senate, and through grateful mayors and prime ministers, you will rule the entire country.
I'm sure it isn't.
After all, there is nothing wrong with discussing the number of Members.
French President Macron announced a third reduction in the Legislature, while there are 57,000 French legislators there, while we have 17,000 Czechs.
However, no one blames Macrona for threatening democracy.
Even if in the Czech Republic someone wins the election mostly, we have mechanisms to prevent him from making any dramatic changes.
The clues for who has a parliamentary majority are, however, large, just look into Poland or Hungary.
Nothing like that in the case of a movement, yes, there's no danger.
We just need a team that's going to work in government for people, not for their gangs or resorts.
I don't understand why we couldn't agree that it would only increase the salaries of teachers, staff in culture and social services.
Why did they vote me out and add 21 percent to the GIBS who are already taking 60,000?
Would you like to be Prime Minister?
The Prime Minister is to intervene when ministers behave unscrupulously, confuse the government with the travel agency, and for the money of the state they would like to do as Marian Jurek, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers in the government don't have to argue, they have to say no to her.
The cabinet must go to the finished material, where there is no room for coalition breaks, strong voting and business, there is a decision to be made.
How do you want to have a team together when ministers act primarily side-by-side?
There's a constitutional law on the sides.
When it came to breaking the bread, Sobotka said the coalition contract was out of effect, and Babish was out of the government.
Any prime minister can do that.
But if he is a personality and has control skills, a similar planal gesture is not needed.
It's all the same to everyone, and it requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you'd propose to be Minister of Finance?
I don't think about it at all. We're not even going to be in that government. Nobody wants to work with us, even though I don't know what the hell I did.
So much skepticism isn't in place.
The mayors have taken over Grandpa's entrepreneurs, who would like to cooperate with you, and perhaps the people will win the wing of you sympathized Jiří Cunk.
I don't think so.
ČSSD leads Lubomír Zaorálek, which does not rule out the coalition with ANO, perhaps in the ODS will penetrate Václav Klaus ml., which will also not oppose.
I'd leave it on the voters.
Vice Prime Minister and Vice-President ANO Richard Brabec said that you have many common points with SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the economics area.
So the Ocamourists come to be seen as a coalition partner?
Mr Brabec says he didn't say it like that.
Mr. Okamura has a political history, ran as a puppet Vita Barta for the VV, then got money from the dawn for his company, went through a coup.
He is, of course, a distinct personality.
Of course, it's kind of brown.
When I take his program, there's a wide range of people involved in the management of society, direct democracy, and that's okay with it.
That's not what I'm asking you.
I wonder, is it acceptable for you to have xenophobic opinions speaking at demonstrations with gimmicks and wanting to step out of the EU?
We're not thinking about working with Mr. Okamura, I can't imagine.
Obviously, he went to politics to profit from it.
And what silently supports the communists to your minority government?
I can't even imagine it, but the voters will decide.
It will be about negotiating the winner with the other in a row, but God knows who will be the winner and who will be the two.
Of course, it is important that they be able to agree on a coalition government programme.
Let's go back to your attempt to drive the state as a company.
But the government just has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything go away, never decided.
Coalition matters such as CEB or EGAP did not work.
But Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that's why he fired me.
As soon as he did, CEZ took over the Czech government.
It is unbelievable, however, that the Prime Minister brought a resolution written by the management of ČEZ, which gives the Minister the money to vote at the general meeting of CEZ.
If you became prime minister, would you change the personnel ratios of the Supervisory Board and change the top management of CEZ?
Jesus Christ, if I'm the Prime Minister, I'll see you.
I'm not him yet.
CEZ's already sending out signals in your direction.
He would like to trade good cooperation with the ČSSD for even better with the YES.
Maybe after the election, everything will move on.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have a humble lobbyist or pinkie, I'm a separate unit, and I'm not dealing with this at all.
Then answer directly.
If you stand in the head of government, will you seek to exchange the leadership of ČEZ, Czech television, or the General Health Insurance Agency, the institution you are criticizing?
I would like CEZ to be a transparent society.
So far, you've been doing what you wanted for years, thanks to the commissions for traditional political parties.
All you have to do is track Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although he's supposed to be in CEZ Majority, he's never driven it, he's only been there in numbers, which is wrong.
It's a trivial matter to me.
ČEZ is to take Dukovany, appreciate them, push them into the subsidiary, arrange funding, make a supplier's competition or get a Koinvestor and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the state should finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And the Czech TV?
Some of her shows are running a permanent purpose campaign against me, but I don't have and I won't have any authority to fire anyone.
But to control it is.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay for public broadcasting and television fees about 7.2 billion a year, but they don't really know how these institutions operate.
How come they don't know?
The House approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of the CEOs of the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic.
Look at how these reports are being discussed, the super-powerful Sobotka Kalousek pact, which has always worked.
This applies both to the current Parliamentary Commission for the leaks from the investigation files and to lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he was pushed by Kalousk to kick me out of the government, which lost a percentage of TOP 09, but the ČSSD took them away.
They fear the disruption of their corrupt system, so they speak of the threat of democracy by Babish.
No one's immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the first Vice-President, ANO Jaroslav Faltínek, builds power facilities by taking his son to Tepláren Brno’s supervisory board and arranging contracts with city and state companies such as the Prague Transport Company or the Czech Railways?
We have a permanent dispute about that.
I don't like it, and I've told him a few times.
Faltínek argues that the lawyer in question works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As Minister of Finance, I had no one.
We, unlike the Socans, have never had a corrupt affair, no Pelt, no Kratochvilová, no Bresin.
If there was any sign of clientelism with us, we immediately threw out such a man.
I'm uncompromising in this regard.
If something like this happens, we get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
