In my view, the programme on literature was formed by the ladies of the Balzak age on the basis of their interests.
From Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Daniel and Volkonsky.
They wrote the fiction, of course, from the point of view of those same ladies of Balzak age.
And the psychology and torture of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not so interesting to teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in hero psychology.
Thank you very much, very interesting.
Perhaps the roses were ivy to represent certain varieties?
There are roses of this colour and with this texture of a sticker, which resembles a barrel, usually of dark, red, boarded tones.

Matras Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
Micropacket Prestige model: comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has a different rigidity of the sides: the medium-hot surface is formed by latex lattice and natural latex, moderately soft, which is a plate of natural latex.
The spring block from 1000 springs to a square metre quickly adapts under the sleeping body, warning the effect of “wool” or “gamaka”.
Among the merits of the model, breathing materials should be allocated.
The latex perforated for airtightness is perfectly ventilated in a natural way, as is the cocoon.
As a result, a healthy sleeping - place microclimate remains.
An extended guarantee period is also extended to the mattresses.
The period of formal warranty from the manufacturer is five years, in fact, more than the period of service of the mattress.
The protection against dust and pollution is placed on the detachment of the chocolate provided in the kit.
Getting an orthopedic pillow as a pair of mattresses – it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spinal cord during sleep.
The filler determines the appointment of the parties – coconut serves anatomical back support; latex relaxes the muscles.

Andrey, you've been well informed that there are pensioners working in the schools, they won't work in the command line.
An IT teacher can't help either, he hasn't been taught, a school's playing games with a vindoise.
So no support.
I can't help but remember these curtains and the guests at my parents' house.

And then another feather bowl, put the house away.
A week before the holiday, you're bringing food, two days of snapping, day of cleaning after.
What about the guests?
They're good, and they're definitely cute.
I haven't loved holidays since then, guests.
Even for my family, I'm covering a table at least.
And I cook them deliciously, and I cook them very often just like that.
Germany: Fourth cap from coronavirus inevitable
A fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany would not be final, but would continue with new force.
Despite an active addictive campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of coronavirus vaccine are likely to be sufficient for full protection.
This is convinced by the head of the Association of Physicians of the Common Practices of Ulrich Weigeldt.
On Saturday, December 11, Die Welt reports.
“We expect the fourth vaccination to be required in the summer, at the latest in the autumn”, said the expert.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that a fourth vaccination against coronavirus could be carried out “in combination with influenza vaccination”.
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination can help to combat the spread of the new strain of the coronavirus Omicron.
But the new option is particularly dangerous.
For example, the probability of re-infection of Omicron is three times higher than that of Delta or Beta strains.
This is illustrated by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Therefore, by March 2022, producers of BioNTech / Pfizer are planning to provide a vaccine adapted to Omicron.
Companies stress that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against contamination by the new version of the corona virus Omicron.
The study of BioNTech and Pfizer showed that at two doses, the effectiveness of the vaccine is significantly lower: “neutralizing potential decreases by more than 25 times”.
“This indicates that the two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against omicron strain infection”, emphasized BioNTech and Pfizer.
A third dose is therefore required.
Experts insist on accelerating the rate of vaccination in the country.
For example, Bernd Zalzberger, President of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, advocates a reduction in the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, as Zalzberger believes, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron of the coronavirus.
“Israel’s experience shows this very convincingly,” emphasized the expert.
Voller Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 years old.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (as the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other species by originally designed to be used for a cold-fishing fishery, not just to catch discards.
These chambers have greater weight than close to analogues, which undoubtedly has a positive impact on the nuances of applying these interesting lures.
Another known feature is the upper flipper of a solid and rigid plastic, which creates additional vibrations in vertical and horizontal wires.
As a winter windstorm, the bet-A-Vib is a rather aggressive game.
Often the most catchy is simple monotonous animation, i.e., a hitter up and down almost without pauses.
In planning the deviation from the vertical axis, which is convenient for fishing in a restricted area, covered by underwater vegetation, corrugated and other obstacles for which a chain may be applied.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant in the winter of the ship and in the big eye, especially in the middle of the winter, when the bait is needed for precise and aggressive use.
By reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, the Bet-A-Vib rotates and returns to the reference vertical.
At least successful Bet-A-Vib is also used for the winter catch of the fermented trout.
To satisfy its caprists, you can choose from two modifications: a noise capsule (NS-NanoSound) or without it (SL-Silent).
It is also noted that the Bet-A-Vib game in the pack can irritate passive noise that does not even react to mercury.
When fishing for Bet-A-Vib, it shows distance and precision.
It's clear, it's not capricious, it's good to combine with wood and knitted cords, even with large diameters.
For the purpose of trapping the hooks, the boat, the shaft or the leg, except for the equally relevant and the “step”, sometimes with the “stitch” at the bottom.
If you're trapped, you can change the front triangle to a doppelganger, which will reduce the probability of seizures.
Among the lures of his class of Bet-A-Vib among the most sustainable of his work and, as a result, one of the most striking.
With the same success, it can be used both on relatively small and in relatively deep areas.
All models are equipped with the Owner ST-36 pins.

In Libya 7,000 Russian mercenaries claimed
There are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (PVC) Wagner in Libya.
On Sunday, 12 December, the President of the High Council of the Republic of Khaled Al-Mishri said so.
“For the time being, there are more than 7,000 WWQ mercenaries in Libya.
They also have planes.
They also spin trenches in Sirte and Kuffre.
They have 30 jet planes on the Gardabia (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte) " - the Anadolu agency says it.
Khaled Al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries were “trying to seize” the central part of Libya, extending from Chad to the Mediterranean, after “bringing their man to power” in the Central African Republic.
Keeping the Presence
According to the press interlocutor, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “delegated to Libya”.
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using the airbase and port in Sirte, as well as the airbase in Jüfre, is noted in the agency's publications.
The Russian authorities have formally denied that Wagner PMC enjoys the support of the Kremlin.
Where else are the mercenaries?
According to the agency, Wagner is allegedly operating in nine African countries - Central Africa, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries are granted certain privileges and licences for the use of mineral and natural resources, as well as for the supply of arms, technology and military services to those countries," the article said.
According to the media, "Vagners" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the Central African Republic.
This group is not part of the force agencies, nor of the register of lawyers, and its fighters are not in the form of personnel lists.
This company is under U.S. sanctions.
Recall that the previous 27 EU countries have approved restrictions against Wagner.
It is expected that this decision will be approved by the European Union Council on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme Council of the State of Libya de facto is the second House of Parliament, with consultative functions with its dominant Islamists, the TSS writes.
This body has repeatedly called for a roll-over of a single day of voting on the election of Parliamentary and Head of State from 24 December to at least February 2022.
“The election remains for less than two weeks, and the chances that they will be rapidly reduced in time” is noted in the material.
Against this backdrop, the Libyan High Electoral Commission has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates indefinitely, transmitting Sky News Arabia's television channel.
Russian foreign policy
38 per cent of Russians see more success in foreign policy than failure, 29 per cent feel that failures prevail.
"Examples of success - "Syria has defended, restored peace there," "decision on the North Stream-2", "the whole world has intimidated that great weaponry," "Crimus we have held back."
The main failures are “conflict with Ukraine”, “confrontation with Western countries”, “insulation from peace”, stated in the study of the Social Opinion Foundation.
The Dubai Government has completely rejected paper production - all the public services have also become digital
The Government of Dubai reported a complete refusal of paper production and a shift to digital technology.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This has been reported by the Emirate WAM News Agency.
"Today marked the beginning of a new phase of digitization of all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government," said the successor prince of the Emirates, President of the Dubai Executive Council, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktum on Saturday.
The internal and external documentation of all States in Dubai will now be done digitally only through special information platforms.
The innovations affected all sectors without exception: health care, HQC, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures have also joined the Government initiative.
The transition to the e-government and digitization of the document has started in Dubai since 2018.
At that time, the authorities estimated that 336 million paper sheets had been saved, representing 14 million human hours of work and $353.8 million of cash equivalent.
Formerly Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobjanin stated that electronic services would save citizens 2 days a year.
Dana, well, the date of birth and the age of the baby, it's already a hate, the class and the group in the nursery, too.
Well, I don't believe there's any of that kind.
And if they do, they clearly care about everything, including the family.
My mother, her two brothers and grandparents, lived in Vladimir's 3rd, and there was 1 floor without bars.
They knocked at the door first, then at the window, and then they decided not to ceremonially, and they broke the window and entered, but Grandpa had the baseball bat they got.
These people knew that there was someone at home...
Turkish car production and export fell below the 2020 level
Turkey ' s production and export of cars fell sharply in November against the backdrop of the depreciation of the lira.
As a result, the industrial performance of 11 months was worse last year, Bloomberg reported, referring to data from the Association of Road Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the association, in November, 115 000 vehicles were released from factories in Turkey, which is 20% less than the previous year.
Some 77.9 thousand vehicles were shipped to export, which is more than 25 per cent of the last year ' s figure.
And if, as a result of the first 10 months of this year, Turkey's road sector had shown positive developments by last year, after 11 months of 2021, it had already been a 0.3 per cent worse than last year's output.
The fall resulted in a sharp decrease in the Turkish lira rate, which in November was 29 per cent relative to the dollar.
This has led to the decline of economic activity in all sectors.
Over 500 IAS entities received credit suspension in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailov described the situation with regard to granting benefits to small and medium-sized businesses, reports MIA correspondent Kazinform.
“As reported by the Financial Market Regulatory and Development Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan, this year, pursuant to the instructions of the Head of State dated 1 April 2021, the order of the Chairman of the Agency of 9 April 2021 No. 127 concerning the approval of the Arrangement for the deferral of payments for loans to small and medium-sized enterprises”, wrote Alihan Smailov in his reply to a parliamentary request.
He recalled that the procedure for deferral of loan payments included the provision by banks and microfinance organizations of deferral of credit payments to entities of the IAS, including IP, prior to 1 April 2021, during the period from 1 April to 30 June 2021.
The deferral period was 30 to 90 days for the selection of the entity of the IAS.
The borrower ' s application could have indicated a different time limit for deferrals.
During the deferral period for the borrower, the claim-claiming work, the notification of the need to settle arrears, as well as the charge by the creditor of the commissions and other payments were suspended”, noted the Deputy.
In 2021, banks at the second level received requests for deferral of loans to 603 loan-holders of the IAS, from which 553 entities of the IAS were granted a deferral of 9.7 billion tenge.
In IFO applications for deferment of 131 IAS entities, of which 95 entities with a deferral amount of 105.8 million tenge were granted to 95 entities", concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Purasev suggested that people with weak immunity could easily carry the strain of “ocmiron”
The doctor suggested that those with impaired immunity could carry it more easily than those with a strong protective response.
Pulmonologist Sergei Purissev explained why the strain of the coronavirus “ocmiron” could be dangerous.
There's a reason to look under the virulent conditions.
Scientists believe that “ochmiron” has originated in an infected or immunodeficiency body.
I mean, in mutation, he didn't find any resistance to immunity.
That's why he's more aggressive.
Because there was no response from immunity, he became very quick.
Apparently he's got these spikes, the spikes, maybe more than that, and the antibodies didn't cut them during the mutations, comments Pulmonologist Sergei Purassev.
The doctor suggested that people with impaired immunity could carry an “ocmiron” more easily than those with a strong protective response.
It turns out that the body's strong response to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
That's what happens in pneumococcal infections when a young man is 30 years old and a 60-year-old man is carrying it.
The immune response of a young man is totally inadequate: where only a finger could be threatened, he beats like a gun on thieves, he locked Sergey Purassev.
The doctor also recalled that coronavirus had dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them were pneumonia.
Lung inflammation is bacterial and viral.
If the first one is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case only symptoms can be bought - all the hope of the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the start of intoxification of the body — temperature, weakness, inflammation.
Then there's respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, front of the throat, cough.
Pains on the right or on the left, abdominal pains may also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, a 12 - to 18 - year - old generation may be vaccinated in Russia by the end of the year.
The virologist, the head of the laboratory of the genetic engineering of the FTA, Pavel Volchkov, noted that this category is very heavily affected by icicles.
Adolescents who go to school have the maximum number of contacts.
This is the most socially active layer, like kindergarten students, said "Moscwe 24" Pavel Volchkov, a virologist, the head of the lab of the genetic engineering of the FTI.
Thanking the author very much for this article.
I'd love to freshen up my memories...
Teath-In.
In that distance, the seventy-eighty-eighties, no dancers ever did without the tunes of this group.
And at home, together with friends, they danced under their music.
Immunologists have developed a hypothesis as to why obese people are victims of icicles.
The authors examined the fatty tissue remaining from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells known as adipocytes could be infected with coronavirus.
The immune cells in the fatty tissue, the macrophages, were also infected, with a strong inflammatory reaction.
Scientists also examined the fatty tissue of patients who died of icicles and discovered particles of coronavirus in the fat surrounding various organs.
HIV and influenza are known to be hiding in the fatty tissue using it as a reservoir in an attempt to avoid immune response.
It's probably also capable of SARS-CoV-2.
Biologist described the causes of dementia
Semen Golosheikin, a candidate for biological sciences, described the causes of dementia and how to prevent it in a radio interview Sputnik.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome appears to be a gradual loss of cognitive function - in time, it is difficult for a person to point out even in a familiar environment.
Goloshakin noted that neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins were most common.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioural level, factors such as social exclusion and lack of active cognitive activity are possible," he said.
Dementia is also influenced by harmful habits — smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disturbances and lifestyles.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and lower abstract thinking.
“The discussion that loss of hearing can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease and a risk factor for its emergence” added the biologist.
In order to prevent the occurrence of the disease, WHO recommends that the necessary level of fissure be maintained, that cognitive skills and abilities be trained that require memory and logic.
Previously, Professor of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics, FGAOU, in his early years as a professor of neurosurgery, neurosurgery and medical genetics.
N.I. Pirogova, head of the Cognition Division of the Federal Centre of Brain and Neurotechnology, Anna Bogolepov, described the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returned some 30,000 illegal artifacts from the country
Over the past 10 years, the Government of Cairo has succeeded in returning some 30,000 artifacts that have been smuggled out of the country illegally.
This was reported on Saturday, 11 December, by Al-Hayat, the Chief Inspector of the Department of Ancient Repatriation of the Ministry of Tourism and Ancient Egypt Shaaban Abdel Gauad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian State has returned 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, the Bible Museum in Washington discovered 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization," he said.
Abdel Gauad explained that all smuggled by the artifacts were registered in the archives.
Department staff are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts “track auctions around the world and online sales” through foreign and Egyptian websites and social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that after the return, cultural values were restored and then exhibited in museums.
He said that one of the returned artifacts was discovered in Belgium by an ancient skeleton of a man who is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help find Pharaoh Tutankhamon's bust sold at an auction in London.
Christie's auction house held trades on 4 July at which a bust over 3,000 years of age was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million roubles).
This caused discontent on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that art was smuggled from the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, as depicted in the image of the sun god of Ammon, was kept in a private collection and was not traded since 1985.
How the relic fell into Europe is unknown.
Egypt has been actively seeking to repatriate illegally removed ancient monuments in recent years.
According to the authorities, 95 per cent of the smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological surveys of black diggers.
“No account is taken of the Crimean Tatars” - and this is correct, because the Crimean Tatars (232,000) are a separate people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42,000 people live in the Crimea.
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of that people is two words.
Only the Turkish language group unites them.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to personal mobile devices for staff
Credit Suisse requires its staff to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, writes Financial Times.
The point is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss Bank does not issue corporate communication devices to its employees, instead offering a discount on the acquisition of a mobile phone or smartphone from a telecommunications operator partner.
According to the rules in force, the bank can see information on corporate devices issued to its employees because they are used to deal with business issues with colleagues or clients.
The Bank has the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if the staff member has used it to meet a client who has not been approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many staff members have moved to a remote mode of work, the bank wants to extend this rule to all the devices that have been used to deal with the working issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank’s management has set a deadline for staff members to get to know the new rule.
Officially, there is no comment on the new requirement in Credit Suisse.

Part 4
The last year of the life of Sergey Asenin, 1925, was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the most difficult for an earthly poet and his ego.
He's already out of any literary associations, he's immersed in immobilism, he's by himself, but he's famous, he's scared, he's sometimes strong with critics, even mean, but the audience is ready to carry him around.
In a year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them true masterpieces, completed the cycle "Persid Motives", written by Anna Snegina, published by 8 books, the collection "Russia Soviets".
And the main success, at the end of June 25th, Gozizdat entered into a contract with Eseni for the publication of his third volumes.
None of the modern-day Sergey Alexandrovich's poets had such honor, he was the first!
In addition, it was worth very good money - under the contract the fee was 1000 roubles per month for 20 months (the factory director, for example, received 300 rubs per month, engineer - 200).
The funds that year were needed more than ever.
Esenin married the granddaughter of Lviv Tolstoy Sofie Tolstoy, and she had to attend a family home, to support the sisters Katyu and Sasha, as well as her mother.
Life seems to be in tune, there is something to be rejoiced about, but for him it is mostly dark tones, as if the Black Man nightmare (written in November 1925 and published after the death of Autumn):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don't know where that pain came from.
It's the wind blowing.
Over the deserted and deserted field,
I'm growing up in September.
He's filling his brains with alcohol.
Many acquaintances noted that Esenin had given up heavily, looked ill, apparently ill.
There's more and more confusion, nerve breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not just in alcoholism...
After all, if this is a diagnosis of alcoholism -- Sergey Alexandrovich -- someone who did, there are no valid documents left.
Let's say, as far as May 1923, when Esenin insists on the fourth wife, American woman Eisedora Duncan was fixing health at a clinic in Paris at Professor Peter Gannushkin (against him Esenin will be two years later, already in Moscow).
And here's the testimony of the poets, the scandals on this soil, the police being brought to the police, and they're being torn apart by dozens of memoirs.
Since the early 20s, the fearsome novel of a poet with a green snake has evolved rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Esenin settled for a short time with a friend named Ivan Starceva.
Surprisingly, however, Esenin’s very good income never had his own home in Moscow or Peter, and he stayed in rented apartments, hotels, or acquaintances.
The elders recall:
"He came only to stay at night, and in most cases in uninterrupted, drunk state.
One day, when Esenin came home at four o'clock in the morning, he fell on a stairwell...
Falling, scratching his face and snorkeling.
With a little bit of self, he kept coughing, stabbing his entire bloodstream..."
And Esenin himself, after the European and U.S. War, was a dry law, but Duncan took along a good supply of alcohol, and admitted:
"I didn't see anything there, except the cobbets and the streets...
I'm done and people stop remembering...
And he was, of course...
And I drank because the toast was frozen."

Matras Promex-Oient Duet Latex Econom 100x195
Promtex Orient Duet Latex Econom is a modern-day budget model in the premium-class linear.
The base of the mattress is a block of independent double springs duet.
A softer small spring is inserted inside the large spring.
This allows for a uniform distribution of the load on the mattress.
On both sides, the mattress is supplemented by a filling device, an artificial latex.
It's like a natural latex, but it's more dense and less expensive.
The flexibility and flexibility of this material enhances the comfort of the mattress.
The artificial latex is hypoallergenic; it does not absorb moisture and dust.
Matras is going to be great for a couple with a big difference in weight (of 30 kilos).

He's almost 16 now, and he hasn't been wanted for a long time.
All the energy is about choosing what he's going to make for his life.
He's much more responsible than I was in his age or my husband, who had a periodic problem with the law before the wedding.
Father takes care of his young daughter.
And he loves it, like Lermontov wrote, "foreign love."
Why did the girl cry at the exam when she didn't fail him?
Why didn't he tell his daughter it wasn't school.
Well, she'll have a tail.
So what?
Redeal.
Millions of students know that.
What's this all about?
MID Poland believes that Belarus uses migrants as a “weapon” against the EU
MID Poland believes that Belarus uses migrants as “arms”
Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland Pavel Jablonsky expressed the view that President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus used refugees as “arm” against the European Union and intended to return to such “operation” next year.
A related statement was made in an interview with the Australian Financial Review in the title of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
According to Jablonsky, sanctions against Belarus have been temporarily “stopped by Lukashenko”, but he is “active in the search for new ways”.
The Polish official is also confident that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons “in many places of the world”.
As the website kp.ru wrote, the European Union had previously put into effect the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He referred to 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, there was a willingness to continue to expand restrictive measures against the Republic, “if the situation in the country does not improve”.
Minsk responded by imposing a food embargo on a broad list of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not on the Shadow Hat" When a velvet jacket makes a man laugh
The 2021 world events were dominated by velvet jackets.
Perhaps the first to make a new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
As early as September, at the premiere of the film, “No Time to Die”, he appeared in the barchatine robin pajaca and the traditional band-aided grandmother.
After his example, Prince William was followed twice by a green velvet pyjac at the award ceremony of The Earthshot Prize, which was not in line with the Royal dress code, and then he chose a more classic version for the Royal Variety charity event.
A few weeks ago, the trend was like that of Lionel Messia.
The football player came to pick up the seventh Golden Ball in a burgundy jacket Dolce & Gabbana.
By the way, his sons were dressed the same way.
Ali Express already notes the growing demand for men's velvet jackets in Russia.
According to analysts at Gazeta.Ru, they began to be purchased 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are the warm velvet jackets with a lining and a silhouette, the main colors are dark, running, onboard, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of these models is between 3 and 6 thousand rubles, and men prefer to buy exclusively jackets - they choose smaller sets of powder suits.
They're not the only ones you can buy from online retailers.
Budget options are in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the range of pyjacas from the brooch this season is presented in almost all brands - Brioni, Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Gucci model, in which he went to one of the premiere films "Dom Gucci" ambassador brand Jared Leto.
By choosing the jackets of expensive stamps, you can be sure that the powder is made of silk.
A special threading technology produces a thick cloth with an external texture and a smooth inner side.
More budgeted options are made of cotton or polyamide, but they also serve less.
The fashionable expert, Lamoda Ilya Vahoshkin, warns that, in the case of powdery jackets, it is not his model or his face, but his relevance.
"Barhat requires the evening light, so such a jacket is perfect if you're going to a party or a solemn event, explains Vachoshkin. "He's going to do it if you have a "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie" in the invitation.
Another important criterion, which is allowed to choose for the amber jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"The man in the burgundy jacket, in the first place, has to get to the right advanced carnage with enough," says Telegram-canal authors of the men's fashion "Crazowwich Brammel."
They are simply being invited to a lively world event where Dress code is always mentioned.
Ilya Vahoshkin offers to combine a teddy jacket with the same stuff: classic brunettes with arrows, single shirts, silk tie, Lopheres with cysts, stickers.
Too simple and everyday things will look inappropriate.
The fashionable experts at Beautybucket Brammel are confident that it will also be inappropriate to have a private corporate employee in a bargat jacket, and that is to say, “the leader of those who are in charge of this activity is yes” to him.
If the employee is lower, and the aim is to move more in the company’s complicated hierarchy or to beat off financial bonuses, it is best not to wear a velvet jacket.
The guide will definitely appreciate it with the phrase "not on the Shadow Hat" - the editors of the Telegram Channel about men's fashion.
Very mixed feelings of voice.
It's an unnatural temp, so worn out.
And she's completely out of touch with a pretty young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of the environment.
But with all my heart, I wish you luck in life!
It's all about money - alternative energy is well lobbying, that is, it's paying.
Billions of investments.
Do they grieve?
No, the price of electricity has risen.
Traditional energy is also not in charge - both gas and oil, and coal is cheaper than it is now selling.
Wild demand for fuel.
It's digging.
Then who's in the air?
As usual, a regular buyer.

Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered as idiots who have lost their energy crisis.

He didn't see any beautiful people in the pictures in the article.
It's just mediocre mediocres.
Perhaps if such characters are so confident of their beauty that they decide to show it on the whole wagon, they will not be able to sit down like that.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such beautiful ones, but certainly not because of their appearance.

Immunologist stated that recovery after 4-5 months would help to protect against the strain of coronavirus " micron "
Revaccination within four or five months can protect against the new strain of coronary infection of micron.
This statement was made by Immunologist Nikolay Kruchkov, who called it a habit six months later, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, “very long period”
"In the previous strains, this period was normal, but now it is best to follow the procedure in five months, and the people with chronic diseases in four," said the expert, in parallel with the vaccination campaign, to engage in rehabilitation.
Krychkov also noted that early recovery provides a good titre of neutralizing antibodies.
“If a person has received two vaccinations and a booster, or has been vaccinated and vaccinated and is over, he has received “hybrid immunity”, which is an antibody of many and neutralizing enough”, the expert clarified.
"The Big Seven" warned Russia of "major consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The Greater Seven countries (United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan, France and the United States) issued a statement following the meeting of heads of the LID in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that Russia's “military aggression” against Ukraine “will have enormous consequences and will be costly” to Moscow, but no concrete measures are described in the document.
“We, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of the increased military strength of Russia and the aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine”, the statement states.
The Ministers further call on Russia to “relieve escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations regarding transparency of military activities”, as President Baiden of the United States spoke to President Putin on 7 December during the video call.
“We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany, in the Norman format, to achieve full implementation of the Minsk Agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine”, said the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the 7th.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia must not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have enormous consequences and a serious price in response," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign State to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," the statement also states.
Earlier in the day, British diplomacy chief Elizabeth Trass stated that Russia would be subjected to “serious consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
She said that the meeting showed “one voice from the countries of the Greater Seven, which accounted for 50 per cent of the world's GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have a huge impact on Russia”.
Pfizer vaccine was found to be 32 times less effective than omicron strain.
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the coronavirus omicron strain is 32 times lower than the remaining diseases.
Scientists at the University of Hong Kong and the University of China of Hong Kong have come to that conclusion and transmits South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was found to be less effective on the basis of a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of COVID-19.
“We see that most people have had a high level of antiviral activity against the Sars-CoV-2 baseline, but this ability has been significantly reduced against omicron diversity”, said Professor Malik Pairis.
In doing so, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe disease from coronavirus infection.
Previously, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of a coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the impact of the omicron strain.
The authors of the study concluded that omicron strain could trigger a new wave of viral circulation and increase mortality unless additional measures were taken.
The head of Ukraine's Minoborone accused the FWG of blocking NATO arms transfers to Kiev
The head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence, Alexei Reznikov, accused the Government of the former Chancellor of the FWG, Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev's acquisition of lethal weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on 12 December, Reznikov recalled that last month, Germany vetoed the purchase by Ukraine of anti-Sniper systems and rifles to defeat drones.
It is noted that later Berlin softened its position on rifles by recognizing their non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defence, Kiev intends to acquire the above-mentioned weapons through bilateral agreements with allies.
These include the United States, Britain, Lithuania and France.
FT notes, however, that the position of the new German Government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholtz on the authorization of arms transfers to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ambassador Andrey Melnik of Ukraine in Germany expressed the view that Kiev should not wait for Berlin to deliver arms to Chancellor Scholce.
He said that the previous FWG leadership had explained its refusal to provide arms with a risk of developing a military escalation of the conflict in Donbass despite the “occupation by Russia” of part of Ukrainian territory.
The same “nillogical” position, a certain diplomat, Germany will remain with the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky stated that Kiev was awaiting assistance from Berlin in equipping the navy.
In Ukraine, it is expected that Germany will “be a technical partner of Ukraine” added the President.
It was also noted that, in the spring of this year, FWG Co-Chair Robert Habeck visited a republic where he advocated the sale of defence weapons to Kiev.

Discovered Ways to Return Stolen Through Online Money Shops
There are several ways to return money stolen through internet stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
Information security experts interviewed the RBC revealed them.
For example, it is recommended that, in order to reduce the risk of significant losses in the acquisition of data from a bank map into the hands of maliciouss, the main assets are stored in a map or bank account that are not used in online shopping.
A portion of the savings may be deferred to a savings account and withdrawn as necessary.
Experts also recommend that a separate purchase map be established on the network.
If the money has been stolen from shops that do not use 3D Secure technology, a refund procedure may be initiated.
“As part of the rules established by the payment systems on unauthorized transactions carried out without 3D Secure, the responsibility rests with the participant in the settlement chain who does not use the service”, specified the representative of the Promotion Bank.
The expert from Ecommpayer Ecommpay Artur Qezba stressed that the buyer had the right to apply to the bank to challenge the fraud operation not later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender used an online resource map that did not require two-factory authorization, the transaction could be protested and returned.
It is noted that in some cases Internet stores themselves return funds to the client if the order has not yet been shipped.
On 19 November, a member of the Public Chamber, the Director of the Safe Internet League, Ekaterina Mizulina, reported that 11,000 cases of fraud had been received in 2021 alone, ranging from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
She said that an effective solution in the current circumstances could be to create a single window for online fraud complaints.
Scholtz arrived in Poland to discuss North Stream-2 and EU legislation
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholtz, has arrived in Warsaw to negotiate a crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the strengthening of Russian troops within Ukraine's borders and the situation with the Russian pipeline North Stream-2.
Although Scholz expressed his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unequivocal expectations of each other.
Prime Minister Mateusz Moravecki stated that he would encourage Scholtz to take action against the North Stream-2, which would lead Russian gas to Germany to bypass Ukraine.
According to Moravecki, Russia can use gas pipelines against Europe as a means of political pressure.
Germany, in turn, supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels resolve the crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for the disagreement.
The European Court of Justice fined Poland, finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party “Right and justice” violated EU law.
Poland refused to pay a fine, and its Supreme Court ruled that national legislation had priority over EU rules.
The new German Government, sworn on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, did not undertake to stop the North Stream-2 work in the event of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany about the gas pipeline stopping if Russia invaded Ukraine, a senior US Congressman reported on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm these communications, but Scholz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia violated the border of Ukraine, and this position was confirmed on Sunday by the representatives of the "The Big Seven".

Just don't let them get dirty.

The money found in the church wall is worth $20,000.
The Santechnician, who found money in the church wall in the U.S. state of Texas, will pay the prize.
This is reported in a press release from Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place in the great Evangelical Church of Lakewood, where pastor Joel Austin preaches, promising that God - fearing Christians will be rich and prosperous.
In November 2021, Justin Coley's Santechnician repaired one of the church toilets and found thousands of packages with money and cheques under thermal insulation.
He handed over the founding of the church, and he said that he did not receive even thanks from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you've done and what you could do," he quotes him as KPRC-TV.
Apparently, the discovery is related to a theft that took place in the Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then about $200,000 was lost in cash and $400,000 in checks stored in a church safe.
The money was insured, so the church suffered no loss.
Nevertheless, they have awarded $25,000 for information on criminals.
Justin Coley could not claim this amount, since the prize has expired.
Despite this, the non-profit Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at the time awarded $5,000 and later received an additional $20,000 gift from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the integrity of the plumber.
He'll get $20,000.
It was previously reported that the police questioned pastor Joel Austin about the money found on the wall of Lakewood.

This is reported by CNN Brasil.

Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
And inside of the post-vaccination vaccine, we get the most of the G immunoglobulins (antibodies).
And if you inject both vaccines, you get a lot of A and G immunoglobulins, but there is no solution for double vaccination," said the doctor.
UrFO chief prophylaxis, medical doctor Sergey Tokarev, in turn, stated that the primary advantage of nasal vaccination in conjunction with the injection was the possibility to stop being the carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help in such a case that the body’s protection was supposed to be maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Lowland Region, David Melik-Gusaynov, stated that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic would lead to the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, this is what he sees in other countries, where another wave of the pandemic has come before.

Mass protests of vaccine opponents continue to occur in Europe
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators entered the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with restrictive measures and plans by the authorities to make the cask vaccination compulsory.
Since February of the next year, non-privileged people will have to pay a fine of Euro3,600.
The Spanish, outraged health authorities, conducted a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held posters with the inscription "It's a false pandemic," "I won't be vaccinated."
A major protest against health passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the Autonomous Community, co-certificate is compulsory for access to bars, restaurants, sports halls, nursing homes and night entertainment facilities.
The decision to introduce health passports has been taken by the authorities in several regions in view of the increasing number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than thousands of demonstrators protested the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then it became a clash with the guards of order.
A group of demonstrators began throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officials applied watermarks.

WHO has discovered a “mycron” in six dozen States
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the new strain of the micron corona virus had already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that spreading the new strain could have disastrous consequences.
The rate of spread of the strain was reported in a WHO report.
According to the organization, the strain was already identified in 63 countries on 9 December, in all six WHO regions.
This is because it has become active only since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rate of proliferation of the new version of the coronavirus.
WHO experts are concerned that the new strain on preliminary data could bypass the rate of distribution of Delta strain, the same Indian version of coronavirus, which is now ruling in all absolute countries without exception.
Prior to that, World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhan Gebreyesus stated that the omicron strain could have a significant impact on the progress of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar findings were also found in the United Kingdom.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that the “memicron” in the coming months will wipe out the delta.
And the number of people who are sick only in Britain will be about 1 million, with an official “omecrone” currently suffering from several hundred people in the Kingdom and estimated to be up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the micron strain, while more than 2,000 people will be transported daily to the hospital on peak.
What the British health system will fail to do.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the micron strain is 32 times lower than that of the other diseases.
How Russia's Sputnik V reacts to the micron is not yet known - this will be understandable in the next few weeks.
The Gamalei Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the mictron strain.

In Brazil, seven people died as a result of torrential rains
At least seven people were killed and 175 were injured as a result of heavy castings that hit the north-eastern Brazilian state of Bahia and its neighbours, Minas Gerais.
This is reported in the TSS with reference to rescue services.
In the middle of the week, these states have been circling an extratropical cyclone, resulting in the dropout rate of 450 mm in the region. The 25 municipalities in the state of Bahia have declared a state of emergency, and some of them have experienced the most devastating floods in 35 years.
Several bridges, two dams, blocked traffic on three routes, were destroyed by Stychia.
According to rescuers, some 5,000 people were left without blood, and another 6,000 were forced to leave their homes.
Over 85,000 people in the region were affected by the disaster.

Russians warned of a new scheme of fraud
Instigators have begun to seek new manoeuvres for fraud in video messages.
This is written by News with reference to experts.
According to the director for Ivideon Zaura Abutalimov, the main risk associated with the distribution of video communications is diphtheria.
In this case, a fake video is created by fraud based on real records involving the victim.
As a result, neurosurgery is able to accurately reproduce the characteristics of a person’s conduct.
Butaalimov added that using a dipfike, maliciouss could call familiar victims on video or create a video clip with a copy of the person for blackmail purposes.
“These counterfeitings can easily provoke bulging, because a confounded wretch can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudoscenarios,” said the expert.
The leading system engineer, Varonis Alexander Vetkol, in turn noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could pose specific risks in the case of video-based technologies.

Five actions have been listed to help avoid diabetes
Problems with the level of sugar in blood are among the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to it, nor do they give up.
Diabetes can lead to severe complications, even death, over time.
Preventive activities play a major role in preventing disease formation.
For example, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the amount of various drinks and turning to regular water have a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet products increase blood sugar levels to a dangerous level when used in excess quantities.
Therefore, the first step toward a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
Not only is wrong eating a disease affected, but it also affects habits.
Much movement is needed to reduce the risks of diabetes mellitus.
Specialists advise to adhere to a low-carbon diet.
Such diet will not only help reduce weight, but will also protect against sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
Many cells must be eaten to protect against diabetes.

Dr. Pavlov told us about "Migraine on the weekend" in the laborers.
A few factors may lead to a worsening of sympathies during weekends
The reason for the deterioration of self-esteem after working buildings is often the “migrenia of the weekend” was reported by a well-known medical physician, a medical candidate, a senior professor at the Faculty of Basic Medicine of the Ministry of Science, a scientific director of the Zuhr Pavlov Systemic Medicine clinic in his telegram.
She said that this is especially true of the hardworking ones who suffer from headaches, breakdowns, and weakness during the weekends.
Dr. Pavlov noted that in addition to the fatigue accumulated over the week, there are quite a number of objective reasons for the body’s negative reaction to changing conditions.
On weekends, our lives change radically.
"We've been sleeping for a long time, lying on the couch all day, probably eating more, and drinking less," the doctor argued.
It is heavy and broken because of the transfer and lack of water.”
An additional role is played by the late rise.
So if you stand three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction called the Jetlag.
It occurs in travellers who cross several hourly belts.
To determine which of the factors playing a crucial role in the deterioration of self - feeling, Paul recommended that it be observed that the most important thing is to turn into weekends.

South Africa scientists have stated that Pfizer against the “Omicon” vaccine has been low.
In South Africa, Pfizer vaccine against the "Omicon" was reported to be low.
Scientists in the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
It is estimated that it (the level of neutralization of the "Omikron") corresponds to the (level) effectiveness of the vaccine in 22.5 per cent against the symptom infection, which leads to... doubting the vaccine's ability to protect against infection, the text of a study published on the MedRxiv portal.
At the same time, experts have clarified that the medicine can save you from a severe disease.
Previously, in London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was projected that a coronavirus ometron could cause a new pandemic wave in Britain with more hospitalizations than a year ago.
How many sugars are hidden in ordinary products?
Sugar is not the best source of useful nutrients.
Its excess diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should bear in mind that an unknown word in the product may indicate hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to calorie sugar, composition and glycemic index.
The label may contain several dozen names, essentially identifying sugar.
Some of the most common and common names are glucose and fructose.
Other raw sugars may also be such as dextrose (sugar obtained from maize), levulose (fructose sugar), melassa (black duck), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that are related to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in conditioners, but also in ketchup, in the doctoral sausage, bread, etc.
According to Roscort, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to use whole and unprocessed products, as well as to draw attention to the label and to the many different names of sugar.
The different types of sugar are tastefully different, but whatever the ingredient of the product is called syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white, it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar because not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package but also that vegetables, fruit, etc. contain a certain amount of sugar initially.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be much higher than indicated on the label.
Chancellor Scholtz of Germany: gas will lose its importance to the FWG in 25 years' time
The new Chancellor of the FWG, Olaf Scholz, said that gas imports were losing importance for Germany, as the country continued to decarbonize the economy.
He said that by 2045, Germany planned to completely phase out gas, oil and coal, becoming a climate-neutral country.
“That is 25 years from now the world will be such that the issue of gas transport to the FWG and Europe will play a different role,” said the chancellor.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to be committed to transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as this resource is now important for energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States had made a statement outlining Berlin ' s support for the energy transformation of Ukraine.
Earlier, Germany’s Head of the MoU, Annalen Berbok, stated that the process of certification of the North Stream-2 gas pipeline was ongoing.
According to the Minister, European law on energy should apply to energy projects in the framework of coalition negotiations and the discussion of a coalition treaty.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline was not in conformity with the requirements of the European Union.

In a referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, concluded with the same outcome as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, 12 December, at noon, most New Caledonians voted during a referendum against the independence of their territory.
In doing so, the level of participation in this third vote has been significantly lower than in the two previous votes.
According to preliminary results published by the local authorities, the independence of New Caledonia from France was 3.51 per cent (2,755) of the voters, while 96.49 per cent (75,762) voted "against".
The turnout was 43.90 per cent, with more than 80,000 New Caledonians participating in the elections.
France-Presse commented on these interim findings, “the outcome of these elections did not leave room for doubt” because independence supporters called for voters not to vote.
As proponents of the referendum, they opposed it on 12 December, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevented a full and “honor” election campaign from taking place.
This non-participation thus opened the way to the third victory of the French New Caledonian supporters, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
56.7 per cent of the population voted against independence in 2018, 53.3 per cent in 2020.
According to separatists, they did not accept the results of the last vote and would challenge them at the United Nations.
The President of France, Emmanuel Macron, was told on Sunday, 12 December, in the Elysian Palace, to follow up on this referendum.
The topic of independence of New Caledonia has greatly revived the presidential campaign in France in recent weeks.
Several presidential candidates have expressed their preference for the Territory to remain French, since it is “the last region of the European Union presence in the Pacific”.
“New Caledonia must remain French”, said Eric Zemmoor on several occasions.
The same statement was made by a candidate from the Republicans of Valery Pecres, who published a column in Le Figaro at the end of October calling on the Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position “because it is not his responsibility”.
Nevertheless, the President added, “France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia”.
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed “the strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians be the choice of France”.
Holy, oh, hello!
I'm a little... embarrassed, still awkward, embarrassing.
Thank you for not turning away from my canal.

WSJ readers criticized the article on Russian and US relations
The Wall Street Journal criticized Professor Christopher Hartwell, who described his vision of Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West allegedly offered Ukraine as a victim of Russia.
In his article, he convinced readers of the danger posed by Moscow and allowed a number of insulting remarks addressed to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the end Hartwell called on the Western countries to “take a united front against Russia”.
The WSJ readers disagreed with the position of the U.S. professor.
“This article contains a lot of false information”, RIA Novosti comments one reader.
"Europe is not ours to lose, and Ukraine is not our land.
The US and NATO allies will never enter the nuclear war with Russia for Ukraine," said another.

Magnitude earthquake 5.2 occurred in the Kuryl Islands region
Magnitude Earthquake 5.2 occurred near the island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the earthquake epicentre was 23.1.8 kilometres north-east of the city of North-Kurilsk.
The hearse lay 92.5 km deep.
Previously, seismologists recorded an earthquake of 7.5 in Peru, which affected ten people.

Ukraine will start producing new generation jet drones
The new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will start the development of ANKA-type unmanned jets (BPLAs).
On 11 December, the visiting adviser to the head of the office of Ukrainian President Alexei Arestovic reported this.
That is, they are able to act against air objects, against other drones.
Even against air traffic.
There will be Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish aircraft: hull and the like," the Dialogue.ua quoted him.
In commenting on the main features of ANKA, Arestović said that they were reactive, not disruptive BPLA.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which surpasses it “in all its characteristics”.
The first batch of BPLA should be made by the factory at the end of next year, concluded Arestovic.
ANKA was established by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of a drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve of the Ukrainian headquarters, data were recorded on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile complexes during the military operations of the combined forces in Donbass.
On 6 December, the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelensky, reported that the construction of a factory for the manufacture of modern military drones had begun.
He said that Ukraine intended to use drones.
On 29 September, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Minoborons entered into an agreement on the construction of a centre in Kiev to train staff as well as the testing and maintenance of Turkish BPLA Bayraktar.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called the memorandum “a major real step forward”.
Two lions fled the airport from the container
Lions fled to Singapore airport.
The Straits Times report this.
Two predators were able to leave the container with seven lions arriving on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the runaway lions is lying on the roof of the container.
The beasts could not get away from it because of a line of protective nets.
The opposition ended after Mandai Wildlife Group arrived at the airport with all Singapore Zoos.
They have disabled lions by means of wires with a tranquilizer and are planning to bring them to a quarantine facility.
It was previously reported that in Phnom Penh, Cambodia’s capital, the lion fled from his master’s house and ran down the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, and the people were not harmed.
Specialists warned of cancer threat due to vitamin B9
Studies show that the excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The release of Daily Express warned of this.
Experts believe that there is strong evidence that people who lack folic acid are less likely to develop certain cancers, particularly colorectal cancers.
However, the excess of the required dose on the other hand contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, nutritionist Beth Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
Cancer is increased only if it significantly deviates from this figure to a greater or smaller extent.
Kitchin recommends that vitamin B9 should not be used in tablets without the advice of a doctor, that you monitor the dosage and avoid milking and other food products containing folic acid.
Previously, Rachel Fine, a nutrition consultant, called folic acid, a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is included in the avocado, among other things, Fine recommended that men be more likely to eat the fruit after 50 years.
In Britain, about 75,000 people may die due to the omicron strain.
British scientists forecast that the proliferation of the coronavirus omicron strain in the next five months in England could cause the death of up to 75,000 people unless restrictive measures were tightened in winter.
This was reported by The Guardian, referring to a study by experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast by April 2022, at least 25,000 deaths due to omicron strain will be registered in the country, and about 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the same time, more than 2,000 daily infected persons will be admitted to hospital at the peak of the disease.
“Serious measures to combat coronavirus may be necessary to prevent the overload of the National Health Service if the circulatory strain becomes more contagious than the delta option and the vaccines in force cannot eliminate the infection”, said LSHTM mathematician Rosen Barnard.
The British Health Safety Agency had previously informed that if the rate of spread of the strain remained at the current level, about 1 million cases of contamination would be detected in the country by the end of the year.
By mid-December, however, the strain of omicrons could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
Currently, 1,988 cases of omicron strain coronavirus infection have been detected in Britain, of which 633 have been detected in recent days.
On 9 December, however, the head of British Minhras Sajid Javid indicated that this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.

Richard Kray, I think you think you're not very accessible to most people.
What do you mean, that those in the instagrams are acting, or that they're making sure they're doing it because they're not pretending to be?

If you have a goal and a good dig, you can find something in the junk.

The demand for superpowers has risen by a quarter in the world.
This year ' s rivalry and next year ' s orders are all record in the world, despite calls for a reduction in the hydrocarbon footprint and the fight against climate change.
In the world registry of ships, the number of ordered yachts was 1,200, a quarter more than last year.
In the era of combating the effects of climate change on greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for £50 million and above will not decrease, says Guardian.
But more and more are going on.
This year, 25 per cent more courts were ordered than the previous one.
Brokers say there's been no such fuss in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of land-based contamination and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to coronavirus.
If all of these people used to go to the office and meet business partners personally, the absolute majority of them are now working remotely and the negotiations are zooming.
Broker Will Christy told the paper that the shipyards are taking orders for new yachts 2025 years later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more if only their yacht is ready for at least a year or two before.
"People just want freedom, and super-rich people can afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behaviors of the rich and call them decadent.
Rich, sociologists say, they don't want to understand that in times of deprivation of space, life on yachts or flights on their own planes is a nuisance in society because the elite do not want to share responsibility for climate change with all other humanity.
Economists call on Governments to act and suggest that new taxes and regulations be introduced for superrich people, although they understand that in this mobility, it will be very difficult to implement.
However, only the number of super-achts ordered is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a sternal length of more than 100 metres.
The Norwegian billionaire Reka builds the REV Ocean yacht 183 metres long.
After the drop, it'll be the largest boat in the world.
There is a “loan basin” and an underwater boat designed to study the depths of the sea.
In the existing super-achts, helicopter sites, open-air cinemas, and in some of them, such as McGregor's yacht, were used as a platform for monobars.A professor of economic anthropology at American University, Indiana, Richard Wilk, says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gas choices, carbon footprints produced by super-rich, is negligible.
But it's symbolic, given that there are almost 2,000 billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overuse by a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the emissions from the billionaires are thousands of times larger than that of the world’s average statistician.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, Roman Abramovic is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that have been released into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of the emissary trail was concealed on his Eclipse yacht at a distance of 162.5 metres.
Even if the owner is not on board, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and get the crew to take the boat, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
The superpowers do not bring sympathy to other people when, like Australia's richest woman, Gina Reinhard, who owns mines on the continent, complains through YouTube that there is no place for their giant courts to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships to wash 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol leading to the development of intestinal cancer has been determined.
American scientists have determined how much alcohol per week increases the risk of cancer.
This is what the Daily Express edition says.
Specialists concluded that the use of four or more drinks per week was associated with an increased risk of cancer.
However, the risk of developing the disease increases with an increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, moderately drinking men are more likely to develop intestinal cancer than women.
The exact reason for this type of oncology cannot be determined by scientists, noting only that certain factors have led to the pernicious process of the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or more, dog lovers are confident that these creatures are very intelligent.
But they don't even know how well the four-legged petals really are.
For many years biologists have experimented with various experiments to find out how animal intelligence is developed.
Although the dog’s vocabulary is not as extensive as human, a new study proves that the dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The work of scientists has been published in Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play chess or make poems, they don't make any sense in politics, economics and art, but they often fool their masters.
Some breeds are considered by experts to show better results in understanding the words of the human language, but statistics for accurate conclusions are not yet sufficient.
Some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses, such as Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are able to think logically and that a two - year - old child is not able to learn.

In Ukraine, prepared for U.S. and Russian trade
US and Russia will be “trading” on Ukraine’s NATO entry, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in his article for “Glavred”.
In his view, Washington and Moscow were planning to continue negotiations soon on United States safeguards that Ukraine would not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of US leader Joe Baden on the right of countries to “enter wherever possible”.
If you are offered something unacceptably unacceptable, such as selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not trade, but simply send the offerr.
And with regard to Ukraine, there is a trade," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia did not plan to attack Ukraine, but sought dialogue with Kiev.
"The preparations are made in secret, quickly and immediately towards offensive action, and do not wait for the group to discover and deploy the forces of opposition," he noted.
China promotes the railway industry
Chinese advanced technology attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the China International Rail Transport Exhibition and the production of equipment from 2021, held in the city of Zhuzhou Province of Hunan /Central China.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. enable trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical defects, noted Ho Zhuzhouen's representative.
High-speed trains on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into service at the beginning of this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure the reliability and working capacity of the rolling stock.
In the past six months, China has significantly increased the export of railway vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe have witnessed China's speed.
In May of this year, the first two-story express trains designed in China to export to Europe were created by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co.
At a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometres per hour, these trains will be routed along the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, a subway train developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey began to operate.
The train will be travelling through a metropolis connecting the Istanbul Centre to the airport of the city.
The subway will be opened next year.
This will be Turkey's fastest subway line at a speed of 120 kilometres per hour.
“China’s rail equipment manufacturing industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness”, said Feng Yaoyan, head of the China Trade and Investment Department of the International Trade Promotion Committee /CCSIMT/.
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-end equipment on the world market," said Fen Yaoyan.
After more than 60 years of hard work, through a number of independent research and development, China has established a front-line system for the production of railway equipment, full support facilities and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaosan, the country ranks first on the level of railway electrification and on the running of high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist listed early signs of dementia
Semen Golosheikin, a candidate for biological sciences in conversation with Sputnik radio, listed early signs of dementia.
He said that forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive disorders, such as inability to concentrate, planning, and reduction of abstract thinking, could be signs of future dementia.
Discussions are under way that loss of hearing can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence, said the specialist.
Goloshakin stressed that the causes of dementia could be neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer’s disease and atherosclerosis of the brain receptacles were the most common causes of the syndrome.
The biologist noted that medical experts do not yet know how to treat dementia effectively.
It is therefore necessary to initiate prevention in time.
He said that learning foreign languages and active communication would help reduce the risk of dementia.
WHO also recommends that a moderate level of exercise be maintained, that cognitive skills be regularly trained through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and thinking logic
“Recommendations on the application of various BADs are in place, but their effectiveness and desirability are still being discussed in the scientific community”, said Golosheikin.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of exercise, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies, requiring intense involvement of memory and thinking logic”, said Golosheikin.
Previously, a charity organization for dementia research in the United Kingdom stated that disease is increasingly affecting people over 40 years of age.
Medical experts called early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.
The first warning sign is vision problems, which make it difficult for a patient to identify objects.
Another sign of developing weakness has been called a phase, a state in which a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
Neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent to treatment abroad.
Former President of Georgia, Mikhail Saakashvili, needs psychosocial treatment and rehabilitation abroad, told journalists of the neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of a consulate of doctors established under the Ombudsman of Georgia.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is the leading disease.
The problems of movement, coordination, change of character” said the specialist, noting that this did not go beyond the normative framework and that the ex-president needed to be sent to special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neuro-rehabilitation and psycho-rehabilitation, which we have not found in Georgia," said Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that is not in Georgia.
On the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began to sabotage medical treatment after the prison staff had disciplined him.
Georgian policy has quickly succeeded in abolishing punishment and restoring itself to former rights.

In Spain, protests against COVID passports took place
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests against a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate have taken place, transmitted to Europa Press.
In the capital city of Catalonia, the number of participants was approximately 3,000.
In Barcelona, COVID passports became compulsory to go to bars, restaurants, sports halls, nursing homes and night entertainment facilities.
Many of the manifests came to the action without masks.
They accused the State of totalitarianism of their poster and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, passports for vaccination will also be required for entry into entertainment facilities and restaurants with capacity of more than 50 people.
The protestors in this city claimed a medical dictatorship and the vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infections have been detected since the outbreak of the pandemic, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
It is also planned to impose restrictions on non-vaccinants in Russia.
The drafts on a single QR-code system were introduced by the Government to Gosdum on 12 November.
It is expected that the Russians will be able to visit the venues of mass events, cultural institutions, catering facilities and retail trade with the introduction of either a certificate of vaccination or a transfer of disease, or a medicated discharge from vaccination.
The same rules will be laid down for travel on trains and aircraft.

Great lift: how the Chinese become miners
The Olympics must attract millions of people and help create international resorts in the country
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will allow President CJingpin 1 trillion Yuan to gather, but also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
Tywu ski resort in Zhangziakou, located near the winter Olympics, is becoming more popular with Chinese people.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, greening works are carried out: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to accept international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts, including Zhangzjakou, are located, there are problems with snow.
The main challenge for the long term is to ensure a comfortable and interesting rest in Chinese resorts so that all newcomers will be forever.
But it's a long way from that.
Game Counsellor Justin Downs says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed to ignorance.
Every year, more and more Chinese are sent to the slopes in the winter.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite major changes, it would take many years to create a mining culture here, according to Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to develop actively and create the necessary infrastructure for recreation there.
The 70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chungli, near the venues of the Olympic Winter Games.
He noted that there had been a boom in winter sports in recent years.
Two years ago, no local residents had lost their jobs from Beijing in Chungli.
More and more shops are opening up to trade in clothes and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes, the common halls of the national kitchen are opened.
There is now even a COVID-19 testing station in Taiwan.
China seeks to create a prosperous winter sport industry, its athletes must become leaders of major international competitions, and its resorts and equipment must reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, reported to WHO
More than 500 million people in the world can be plunged into extreme poverty because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed the progress of humanity on universal access to health services, has been declared at the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
Two complementary reports have been published on 12 December by WHO and BB on the International Day for Universal Health.
They found that the pandemic had led to disruptions in the provision of medicine, causing excessive tension in health care systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, the population ' s immunization coverage has decreased, and the mortality rate has increased from tuberculosis and malaria.
WHO and WB stressed that the pandemic had caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it became more difficult for people to pay for treatment”.
This situation pushes over 500 million people “to extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services from their own pocket”.
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated that the coronavirus pandemic had brought more than 100 million people into poverty, and more than four billion people had little social support.

Reuters: Minister of Taiwan has been disconnected from the "Sammy for Democracy" broadcast requested by the White House
The statement by Taiwan's Minister of Digital Technology Audrey Tan to the panel discussion during the U.S. Summit for Democracy was translated into video-free mode, indicates the recording of the summit on YouTube.
With reference to sources, Reuters argues that the image was unlocked at the request of the White House.
They reported that a map had been used to distinguish Taiwan with a distinct colour from the PRC, which considered the island to be its territory.
The map presented by Ms. Tan was drawn up by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world on the level of civil rights.
Taiwan was named green as "free" and the PRC, the DPRK, Laos and Viet Nam were red as "closed".
After the Minister showed the map, the picture on her side was replaced by a boxette with a note that the views of the panellists “are not necessarily expressing the position of the United States Government”.
The PRC was not invited to the Summit for Democracy.
Reuters sources note that the map demonstrated by the Taiwanese Minister could have been contrary to the one-China policy, which Washington adheres to.
One source of the agency stated that, following the demonstration of the map, the U.S. National Security Council had been angry with the State Department, accusing him of having shown Taiwan by a separate country.
The Summit for Democracy, organized by Washington, D.C., took place from 9 to 10 December with the participation of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia wasn't invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" summit of the Nobel Peace Prize winner, the editor-in-chief of the New Gazette, Dmitry Muratov, called for the establishment of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, Under-Secretary of Sowbez RF Yuri Averyanov stated that the summit carried the “anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge”.

A joint mechanism for the prevention and control of the CNR Council of State released a circular requiring the strengthening of the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where the land crossings are located in order to further prevent the introduction of infection from abroad.

Those who arrive in the cities where the land crossing points are located shall, upon arrival, pass at least one COVID-19 nuclear acid test.
The document states that these requirements will be in effect from the day on which the respective provincial administrative units define and publish the zones of the cities concerned until 15 March 2022.
It is also noted that cities with land crossings that meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones to prevent and control the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs described the “insect” between Russia and the United States
Sergey Ryabkov, Russia's Ministry of the Interior, in an interview with News, assessed Moscow and Washington's prospects for relations.
He noted that the long path of interaction had led to sad conclusions, and problems between the two countries had not begun yesterday.
There is a single-sided negative predictability, and in some respects the prospects for improving relations are completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion as a result of the long journey that we have taken with the current administration and with Tramp and Obama.
The problems did not begin yesterday," said the diplomat.
According to Ryabkova, the problems are linked to the U.S.'s desire to impose multiple approaches on Russia.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that it would not risk providing optimistic forecasts of prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington ' s position.
He explained that, except for such areas as strategic stability and cybersecurity, there was no progress.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Formerly Head of the Ministry of the Russian Federation, Sergei Lavrov, in a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, stated that Moscow is ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warned of the risk of vaccination with a COVID nasal substance outside the hospital
The nasal vaccines from COVID-19 may have an allergy and need medical attention, so the first points for the drug to be applied should not be organized at airports and shopping centres.
This was reported by TASS virologist, Correspondent RAN, BioNanatechnologist, Microbiology and virology at the NovoSibir State University, Sergey Netesov.
Organize vaccination sites with nasal vaccines at airports and shopping malls, but I would only do so at first sight in medical facilities.
The problem is that there is a risk of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, it is small, but it is desirable that a person then sit next to a doctor's office.
Doctors have a special set of anti-allergenics that operate literally in a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," Netesov said.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think of vaccinations in shopping malls when experience in the use of the drug is gained.
He also stressed that using a nasal vaccine, it was important that it fall onto the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
However, it is likely that the vaccine will not reach the destination if the nose attached is pumped after injection.

Sandkov warned of the suffering of Western countries imposing anti-Russian sanctions
President Dmitry Peskov, Spokesman of the RF President, commented on the possible imposition of anti-Russian sanctions if “aggressive action” continued against Ukraine, including because of the alleged “invasion” of the country.
“There are restrictions on Russia and it is not possible to suffer alone”, said the official representative of Kremlin on the TV channel Russia 1.
Peskov claims it's "comprehensible to everyone in the world".
Previously, it was reported that the United States was considering the introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the field of energy as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union are planning to impose restrictions to complicate the conversion of roubles into dollars against Russian banks and the Russian direct investment fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank Hermann Greff is confident that this cannot be done.

New Caledoniaans rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final outcome of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the overwhelming majority of participants refused to withdraw from France.
On 12 December, the French television channel BFM.TV reported it.
96.5% of voters opposed independence.
Supported independence from France for 3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific.
The results have been cancelled by 2.99 per cent of the bulletins.
The voting rate on this day was very low: about 55% of the inhabitants of the archipelago arrived at the sites.
According to experts, the low turnout was due to calls by separatists to abandon participation in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the residents of New Caledonia expressed their opposition to independence from France in a referendum.
A referendum on independence had already been held in the region in 2018.
Most residents supported the finding of an archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is nearly 20,000 kilometres from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia to be its own.
Some 270,000 people live in the archipelago, and the Territory has special administrative and territorial status.
A 1998 agreement is in place between Paris and the New Caledonian administration, according to which the region can hold a two-year vote on its independence.

WHO prejudges “miquiron” as less dangerous than “delta”
The World Health Organization (WHO) tentatively believes that the micron is less dangerous than the delta strain of coronavirus.
However, there is evidence of a decrease in vaccine effectiveness with the new COVID-19 option.
According to the information on 9 December, "mikitron" is registered in 63 countries.
“Preliminary data and significantly modified antigen profile of the micron strain strain suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and the transmission of the option.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it (the severity of the disease) may be less severe than in the Delta, according to the WHO Technical Communication.
The Organization notes that so far, all recorded cases of contamination of the “omicon” in the EU are easily or without any symptoms.
However, the new strain, according to preliminary data, is subject to faster deltas.
Two cases of omicron strain infection have been reported in Russia.
They were “pre-immunized”, reported the Gamalei Centre.
President Rospowiadzor Anna Popov stated that there were no reliable data so far that the new version of the coronavirus was less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine four scenarios for Greensko
Ex-Deputy of the Supreme Council Vadim Denisenko listed four options for the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelenski, in 2022.
In his view, the head of State could remain without the support of the West, as well as perhaps compromise on Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko presented this in a publication on the "Glavred" portal.
The first option Denisenko called the “ideal storm” implies that Ukraine will cease to support key Western countries by reaching agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such developments would contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev could face in 2023.
“The prices of key goods, which we traditionally export <...> internal protests and opposition of power with key FPGs (financial and industrial groups)”, added the ex-parliamentary.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario of the situation: “war against all”.
This forecast will be the case in the case of high turbulence in the world policy in which the Ukrainian authorities face a number of challenges.
Because of this state of affairs, Ukraine ' s leadership could compromise on Donbassa, which would result in a possible domestic confrontation.
At the end of the summer, the position of the Green will be weakened, the probability of such a situation, according to the former nardrepa, is up to 50 to 55 per cent.
The third option of developing the situation in Ukrainian politics is the opposition to the Green Group and the President, which makes it possible to take control of the force bloc and implement “populistic initiatives”.
In this way of crisis, the Green will begin “reformation of power” added Denisenko.
Another scenario is turning the Green into the father of the nation.
This may be caused by an event that will be a great shock to society.
“The event must be large enough to trigger reactions from external partners and to increase Ukraine’s support”, Denisenko said.
This option is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technological disaster or aggressive action by Russia, it is considered an ex-deputate.
In doing so, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any “attack” on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that it was the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that increased military activity at Russian borders.
Earlier, on 11 November, a survey of the sociological group "Rating" showed that the Ukrainian president's rating fell to a record low of 19.3 per cent.
This is the lowest indicator since the election of its Head of State.
Analysts predicted a situation in which, in the case of the upcoming elections of the President of Ukraine for Greens, only 21.8% would cast their votes, whereas for the ex-president of Petr Porosenko, 14.5%.
Of all those interviewed, only 19.3 per cent were expressed to the President.

The poet who was arrested for the Red Square's action: "For the quotation of Evtushenko, 10 days is given, and this is the power of poetry!"
In the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Aleksandra Volchenkova was arrested ten days later.
The U.S. student was detained on Red Square with a poster on which hešteg #poetrossy is a great poet.
This quote belongs to the writer Eugenius Eutusenko.
A protocol on the administrative article on the recurrence of public action was drawn up on Alexander.
For the first time, he was detained on 23 January in Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalna.
"The aim was to draw attention to poetry in general, now its interest, unfortunately, has been lost, to the collapse of a common culture in Russia, and the very little hope of inspiring unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We have contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to make his message more widely known.
How did the police treat you this time and before?
What was asked in the department, how did they comment on your action?
This time, staff were more correct, detention was as polite as it might sound in some contexts.
At Pushkin, the gunmen took the gun and took it hard.
They asked standard questions about motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked, if they didn't approve, they understood.
With the exception of all four sides of the monkey, everything was perfectly correct, but I knew what I was going on.
And if after the action under this hashtag starts writing their poems, at least a few people, I'm going to be dead for 10 days.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak tumba-yumba even in the language of the Tumba-yumba tribe.
In public and official events, they speak the language of the public, so that everyone understands what happened in Bundestag on 25 September 2001 or in the native language through the interpreter.
It's a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks beautifully in Russian, and yet she's using the interpreter.

Researchers described how potatoes helped combat age violations
The study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and micronutrients that help improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The root contains vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, follium and pantotic acid.
All these elements help to function the system of the body.
Potatoes also help to combat age violations.

In early December, the Commersant newspaper warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in private households and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, currently only imports could be replaced by a shortage of products.

"This idea developed by the Poles" would be to say that Poland only redesigned the idea of 1776, but developed it quite efficiently.
In fact, the slogan "Okraina-Not Russia" appeared in 1848.
Which, in general, doesn't change much.

The broad circle, framed by the "molecular" of the light, provides maximum uniform and bright light to the space.
A "nuclear" or "molecular" design that reflects the nature and nature of each subject, does not lose its relevance and allows for the advantage of putting emphasis on the interior.
One characteristic of such lamps is the lack of awareness of the design.
The thin, almost invisible wires that are adjustable in height create a feeling that the mirror is steaming in the air.

Only quality and premium fillings have been included in the articles, which have proved to be on the best side only.
Springs: an independent spring block of micropacket is installed in the centre of the model.
This means that there are 2,000 spirals in the bedroom, which operate completely autonomously.

Chargers: a combination of the layers of anchor and natural latex is installed from the spring top and bottom of the spring.
The only difference is the order of swimming.
If one surface has latex, the other has coconut crust.
This kind of charger tandem has long been classical since it passes the mattress not only on orthopedic but also on anatomical properties.
If the cortex provides correct back support, latex gives the surface adaptation under the human body.
Steel: the model is supplied in a flat knitted iron Aloe Vera.
At the client's request, it can be made both dull and stationary.
Total height of the article - 27 cm, recommended space load - 170 kg.

Estonian scientists will be looking for life in Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, prepares three space missions to Venus to find signs of life in the atmosphere, reported on Sunday at the "Actual Chamber".
The purpose of the five-year missions is to assess the viability of the Venus clouds and then to search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed instruments to measure acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
To date, Venus, nearer to Earth, was assumed to be too acidic to have life there, but probably originally Venus was an Earth-type planet.
During the third mission, a sample with Venus should be received.
Suppose we find life there, the main question will be whether it is earthly or different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that life on earth did not begin.
But if it is different, it may be more likely that life was born on Earth," said the manager of the Estonian team of the project "Venus Life Finder" Mihkel Pausal.

Meta-university is changing Russian business.
The theme of the Meta-Valests became popular in the autumn of this year when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook had become Meta.
For the market, this event has become an important signal: the largest game has confirmed the development of a new format for digital interaction among people.
Thus, business in Russia, as in the world, will invest in the creation of its own meta-invasives and their subsequent monetization.
Meta-universes should be seen as continuing objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend towards remotely interacting in a pandemic is that people are tired of divorcing and limiting.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of the business's desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models to them.
Third, they are a logical continuation of the trend of the digitization of assets, where any rights, securities, works of art and even money are translated into digital formats.
Anya, you're right, changing nutrition is an informed process.
When you start eating right, you don't want anything too fat and harmful.
Of course, we're going to have a holiday and a traditional olive, and we're going to have a sledgehammer, but no one's making me eat all the time.
You can eat on the bed, try and stop.
Indeed, ten days of weekends are ahead of you, and you can prepare any delicious and useful dishes.
And how much hell she needed in practice, how much time, how much money she needed in practice.
And when she had done five fourths, she was left without gold.
She also realized that four years before the next Olympics, she would never be an Olympic champion.
And those who did not just engage in sports or could not imagine all the circles of hell that she had gone through, do not lie down with condemnation.
British economist failed to predict 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to predict 2022 because he believed that such attempts would fail.
He wrote about it in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the following year will be filled with unpredictableness and any trend may change the turnover.
The most important factor remains the pandemic of coronavirus, and second, inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether the price increase was temporary or not.
According to the expert, before the pandemic, it was clear that “the world of the infinite generosity of central banks has already survived” and it is time to return to the relationship where inflation-based interest rates will be correlated with the expected rate of GDP growth.
O'Neill noted that, against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of excessive economic policies could, in the opinion of some experts, lead to a new rise in inflation.
In addition, the question of productivity growth, as well as increasing poverty and climate change, was highlighted by O'Neill.
In the past, Michael Schulgin, Head of the Global Research Division, Opening Investment, reported that positive expectations for the dollar for 2022 remained, with the potential for growth being less significant.
Among the risks to the course of the dollar was the monetary policy of the FRC, the evolution of oil prices and the fear of the pandemic of the coronavirus.
Forced to accept.
But one thing is good: If you compare yourself to yourself, five years ago there were fewer containers.
It's better now.

The Russians gave around 4.5% of the country's GDP to motorists.
As a result of the 10 months of 2021, the Russians spent 2 trillion roubles, 28% more than in the same period last year, according to Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI) statistics.
To understand the scale, about the same amount (about 3 trillion roubles) was spent by the State to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount was comparable to more than 4.5 per cent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
On income from the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia runs.
In 10 months of the year, it was able to implement 325.7 billion roubles, nearly 24 per cent more than in the previous year.
The Hyundai birthline has an even greater increase of over 35 per cent, and the profit from selling cars is estimated at 279.3 billion roubles.
At the leading positions, the brand grew by almost 21% in Hyundai and by increasing the weighted average price of the car, to 1.94 million roubles, only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
However, sales from the Korean Brands did not increase so much: according to the statistics of the Automotive Committees of the Association of European Business in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia implemented 9.4 per cent more of the cars in the same period than in the previous year.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
The three leaders close to Japan ' s Toyota ' s cash sales volume - the Russians spent 10 months on the cars of the brand 275.5 billion roubles, 14% more than the previous year.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with a figure of 266.1 billion roubles (+75 per cent) - German premium brand grew and sales (37 per cent) and a weighted average car price (almost 28 per cent to 8.2 million roubles).
"Mercedes-Benz also has a good growth in sales and weighted averages -- more than BMW, for example, hence a higher increase in the financial capacity -- explained the director of the NIP of Tatyana Arabaji.
At the rate of growth, the sales of fantastic indicators show Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased the financial capacity this year.”
Russia's Income Growth Lada shows medium-market indicators (plus 28 per cent), and Russian cars have spent 10 months on 229.4 billion roubles.
At the level of last year's financial capacity, there are companies whose car sales fell in 2021: Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan in particular.
In less than 10 months, the Russians spent 12 billion roubles on off-roaders and pickups of this brand, compared to 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of problems with the supply of auto-companies and disruptions in production covering the entire world's highway, auto companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same "AutoWAZ" increased the cost of the Lada models seven times a year, the latest trip (to 8-10 thousand rubles) took place at the end of November.
Prices are regularly copied to their products and to other car manufacturers.
The volume of the Russian car market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation is making its contribution, as well as the desire of the autoconcerns to play past losses, experts believe.
In the context of a car shortage, I think that many of the autoconcerns have even been able to partially translate into consumers the cost of past periods that they could not have cost cars before,
Says analyst "VTB Capitala" on Vladimir Bespalov Automobile. -
I believe that, financially, car manufacturers are feeling very good right now, supporting the high marginality of sales."
An indirect indicator of this is the rate of increase in the cost of vehicles observed during 2021; prices for new vehicles are increasing faster inflation, the expert said.
In the long term, the market will grow in quantitative terms and in cash, but mainly through inflation and the complexity of the construction of the machines themselves, Besparov predicts.
With the increase in supply, opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian author will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the increase in the cost of the car slows down, the car manufacturers will be able to earn their income by volume, notes independent Automobile Consultant Sergei Burgasliev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now seeking the greatest profit from every car sold, Burgasliev notes.
The increase in machine production is not expected for the next six months, while in Russia the insurgency is also fuelled by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the market situation, cars were a good investment target - the car purchased a year ago, even with a run, could now be sold more valuablely, according to the expert.
Biden expressed support for the transfer of U.S. military to Ukraine in the event of an invasion of Russia
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending U.S. military to Ukraine in the event of an invasion of Russia.
The President of the United States, Joe Biden, made such a statement.
“There has never been such a plan,” said the head of the White House, responding to a journalist's question as to whether the United States has given up such an idea.
Biden noted that in the case of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia would face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the US and NATO had no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using U.S. troops unilaterally for Ukraine ' s defence was not an issue.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the United States would move forces to the eastern European countries of NATO (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
“We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 all NATO countries against which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia”, said Bayden.
Earlier, Russian President Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow had no intention of entering Ukraine.
In doing so, he pointed out that Moscow sees the problem of the military use by Kiev of drones imposed by Turkey and that “American weapons are approaching our territory”.
