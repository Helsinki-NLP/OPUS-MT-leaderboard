The Triumph of Right Pulsists in Austria, combined with 29 per cent
The appreciable weakening of both sides of the existing large coalition and the significant strengthening of right-wing populist parties have resulted in the first preliminary results of Sunday's early parliamentary elections in Austria.
In particular, the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) has suffered severe losses, where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Korutan Heitman Jörg Haider, is planning a triumphal return to national politics.
According to the preliminary results, the strongest party in the country remains social democracy (SPÖ), with 29.8 per cent of the votes, but the final 2006 elections lose 5.5 per cent of the votes.
Even worse, ÖVP lost 25.6 percent of nearly nine percent of the votes.
These are the worst results of both of these great parties in Austria's post-war history, and especially of the people who have called for early elections, literally a disastrous result.
At the beginning of July, when ÖVP came out of the coalition, the people had a significant lead in favour of SPÖ.
However, the voters evidently punished them for having the government destroyed.
In the first reactions to the results, speculation was heard about the possible resignation of the President of the Party and former Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could happen on Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the Bureau of the Party.
Such a development would probably facilitate the path to the most likely outcome of the election, i.e. the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populistic parties - free (FPÖ) - 18 per cent in advance and 11 per cent in BZÖ - the social Democrats also raised concerns about the repeat of 1999, when the people agreed with the populists (the FPÖ was still unified, in 2005 from BZÖ to the common government, which even called for sanctions by the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and anticipates returning to Vienna to national policy.
The Green Party has also reached Parliament, which has easily lost and has fallen between the Austrian political parties from third to fifth.
Obviously, none of the other parties crossed a four-percent line and did not get to Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool off
If the problem could not be solved with Czech scientists who were accused of illegally collecting bugs in India, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg there would be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister reported it in New York following a meeting today with his Indian protégé, Pranáb Mukherdjim.
"If it hadn't been resolved, then yes, then there would have been some cooling," he concluded after a meeting that had taken place from the Czech initiative.
Mukherdji said that the power of executive power can be difficult to intervene in judicial matters.
However, he stated that in the case of Peter Švách, who was acquitted and punished with fines, the central government may deal with the local government in Dardžiling, whose jurisdiction falls within the jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
For Emil Kučer sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherdji's view would be the best way to appeal to a higher instance.
He could then ask for bail and wait for judgment on freedom, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed himself in the course of the meeting.
"It recommends an appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon it," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech party can enter the matter is to provide "competent legal aid" to the convicted persons, said the Indian Minister.
At the same time, he said that the Indian side was already providing such assistance.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relationships with India that have a long tradition.
Indians also recognise it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as the Czech Republic said, he stressed in front of his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider the deep mistake of incarceration and prosecution of these Czech scientists," he said.
The answer to the question of whether the Indian side made the promise to deal with matters was avoided by the Minister.
"I've got quite enough promises," he said.
Czech judges the battle for the seabed
They shall approach the walled electronic map on which Australia and adjacent maritime areas are shown.
But he is not interested in the continent, but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, and along with it is the seabed.
The area, however, is as big as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosso, who is part of the 30-member team of UN Division workers on ocean affairs and maritime law.
His boss, division director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, interprets and sometimes completes.
He's in charge of the workhouse and the enthusiasm.
The seabed hides a little known world, rich in natural resources.
There can be found oil, ores and other mineral materials, but also unknown living organisms that carry the key to developing cancer medicine.
Bottom greater than the mainland
Today, coastal states have begun to run for the new submarine territory.
According to the UN Convention, they exercise their rights under which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so - called Continental Hagoll, which often stretches up to a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the country.
According to the Convention, she has an exclusive right to all the sources of the continental gnarf.
"In a simple way, for a continental jackal there is this part of the seabed and its base, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It goes beyond the coastline, often beyond two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Commission for the definition of the outer limits of the continental cradle must be accompanied by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of a number of years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical assistance.
The Commission has so far discussed five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three of the last mentioned countries have yet to succeed," says Mikulka.
The world’s vote recorded recently Australia’s success as the first major expansion of its submarine countries.
But he also acquired New Zealand, the seabed area that the Commission admitted to him last week, about 1.6 million square kilometres, about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit they will reap in the future from the use of the seabed will be inestimable, as they promise.
Other States shall submit their applications in a gradual manner.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified "the Treaty of Montego Bay".
Where the continental jackal ends, the ocean bottom area begins, declared "the common heritage of mankind".
No state has an exclusive position here.
The right of mining in this area shall be conferred on the Convention by an international institution established.
"The sea bottom, however, is not a Klondajek," says director Mikulka, in his superstition, saying that his "single areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contractually anchored".
Cherries in Pacific
Today part of the seabed belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other countries of the former Eastern Block within the common organisation "Interoceanmetal".
It was acquired in 1991 by the Convention, as well as the investors of several other states, the status of the so-called "pre-copier investor".
He is entitled to enjoy the ClarionClipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean, lying between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The investor's research area is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is a member, it's a kind of undersea Tater replica.
"There can be a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich find of polymetallic convections containing nickel, copper, cobalt and mangan," says another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian division worker, Robert Sandev, is bringing one such virtue to the fore.
It reminds us of a little potato or, in a little fantasy, a fabulous scheme that legend has revived Golem.
Germany's special deployment units were freed hostages
The Egyptian government has asked to deal with the hostage crisis for assistance from Germany - experts have arrived.
When the situation erupted, the special units were ready, but no deployment occurred.
Further details are gradually given to the public on the circumstances of the liberation of 11 European tourists abducted in Egypt.
German special forces were involved indirectly in the rescue action, according to the Ministry of Defence and the Interior.
According to the Ministry's comments, both the experts of the Federal Army and members of the anti-terrorist group of the German police GSG9 were at the site of the liberation, and also the logistics experts from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk).
However, according to a further announcement by the speakers, both ministries from Monday afternoon were not required by the German forces, since the kidnappers let their captives go and flee when they recognized signs of forced release.
According to the Egyptian government, the aid offered by Germany was adopted as a support force for action on the ground.
"Unfortunately, it didn't," said one of the speakers of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian, and eight Egyptian guides to the south of Egypt on 19 September.
After the kidnapping in the desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages moved between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment, as well as details of the release or possible redemption of the ransom.
In the present, the rescues are in order in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said that the liberation of the hostages was in the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of his release.
Information is not yet available in Berlin when the rescue will return to Germany.
According to the letter "Bild", all five tourists should also fly with special forces to one of the German Airbuss and to Germany on Tuesday.
US House of Representatives Rejected Rescue Package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress had the bailout of $700 billion in financial markets.
The Dow Jones index went down hard.
In a ratio of 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. Assembly rejected the government's rescue package for financial markets.
Despite all the challenges of US President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both sides, the majority has not been found for a program that should alleviate chaos in financial markets.
Dramatic events were desperate for criticism of a $700 billion package, yet still convincing.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, called on the Member to give his consent before voting, even though, as he said, the plan is not popular.
"It is difficult to gain political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he acknowledged.
During the vote, the Dow Jones index fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason was the investor's concern that the state rescue package might fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index rose so that, after the notification of the failure of the package, the steepness would fall again.
Experts now count on other serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, the approval of the House of Representatives and the Senate is required.
Travel agents record rising booking rates
It seems that winter will be good for German tourism entrepreneurs:
According to one study, even more than 30 per cent of the winter season’s turnover rose at the next month’s travel bookings compared to the previous year.
Despite weak economic growth, the Germans' desire to travel remains undefiled.
In winter season reservations, travel agents recorded an increase of 31 per cent compared to the same period of last year, as stated by the German Travel Union (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) in Berlin on Monday.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute, an increased number of reservations have already been made available for the autumn months.
The turnover was thus 11 per cent higher in October compared to 2007.
These results are based on the GfK numbers, which evaluates data on reservations from 1200 German travel agencies each month and interpolates them to the general market.
In this result the reservation of tours that took place by the end of August 2008 were included.
Due to a weak dollar course, travel to the U.S. is mainly requested, DRV said.
For these trips, an increase of about one third is made by reservations.
In addition, the Germans are particularly requested targets of Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic water.
Mostly organized tours are on course, said President Klaus Laepple of the DRV.
In view of the rising expenditure on energy and food, there are costs "for the customer, the burden is calculated rather than for individual organised holidays".
Laepple explained that money can be saved by consumers, among other things, by using discounts for early booking or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of reservations was very good, so compared to the previous year, a higher turnover will be recorded again - although according to another study the number of Germans who made a trip has dropped compared to the previous year.
My first Octoberfest
Tonastic repetitive pop, barbeque beer and prominents in the edges of famous designers.
First time on a beer meadow.
Susan Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, TV moderator, and she wears a leather cut.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is from secondhand.
But one thing connects us: we're not even three minutes away on a beer meadow, and the photographers are throwing themselves at us, and the memory cards are full of momentum - it flatters me, for I'm at Oktoberfest for the first time.
This is how you can make friends.
It seems my cheap cut has fulfilled its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and live north of the sausage equator, and so my feeling of comfort was rather limited.
But right after you arrive at Theresienwise, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone wears a woman's dress or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is completely normal.
The special views of a banana stand in chocolate harvest only my apron.
One monk reminds me that I wrongly tied it to myself: "On the left you are free, in the middle of a virgin, on the right, in the back, widowed."
They're going to cut their heads from behind to the left.
"All right," he says, and smiles.
Others with subtle flirting techniques don't care so much and they're wearing simple plastic hats with the inscription "To Drunk to get dressed!" and they pop on the passing naked buttocks.
A young man with such flashing tendencies is called Bob, is from England, and he came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
He's like "gorgeous", with an extended "ooh."
That's what he's telling me after you've been out of your hair.
Right next to one of the hydrants everyone thinks are trash bins.
So Bob is one of the feared Wildbieslers, as in Bavaria it is said to the public to freely urinate.
Others are fortunate to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around 8:00 p.m., the Octoberfest takes place, the medics who have to take care of the poor drinkers.
Medical doctors always show up in flocks - in four they wear covered stretchers from tent to tent.
They work like most visitors to the beer meadow: empty there, full back again.
Anyone lying under the tarpaulin of this casket of error can't be seen.
"That's the one that can't go on," one of the medical officers answered my question and disappeared into the crowd.
The police leaked the name of the victim of the accident.
The name of the 30-year-old woman who died in the hospital after being hit by a car in Essex.
An accident at Shenfield Road, Brentwood, on Friday afternoon, hit Carole Paulson from the Chelmsford Road.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but she died later.
After the accident, an 11-year-old man was arrested for suspected of riding recklessly.
He's already been released for bail.
Turkish diplomatic horizons expanding
Long before Turkey began trying to enter the European Union, they longed for European powers to enter deep into the Turkish border.
On the eastern shore of Bosporus, perhaps only twenty steps in Asia, is one of the best monuments to this unsuccessful imperial ambition.
The Hydarpaša railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Con in a non-orientating style.
That's what the tour guide will tell you.
The building sits at the end of the platform with a tower on each corner of the intersection, looking at the non-recognition from a provincial German town hall.
Rock is dirty.
The whole building is slowly falling apart.
But once a man gets inside a jeweled treasury, he can no longer doubt the size of the company whose most western gate was.
The station opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, which was late involved in the game of empires, intended to pursue its ambition to control the Middle East by means of this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in the territory of Saudi Arabia today.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Their tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular units.
Relative isolation from surrounding areas, caused by frozen borders of cold war, is gone
British and colonial units proceed from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
And bad news has also come to Hydarpas Station.
In 1917, it destroyed the ammunition train explosion of its broken roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has been gradually plunging, and history has surrounded it.
Today, however, these gates to Anatolia and further east serve - at least symbolic - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling party Justice and Development - the ACP - has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from surrounding areas, created by frozen borders of cold war, is gone.
A new policy is now in place - Turkey is engaged.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I sat on a night train to the Turkish capital of Ankara, where I was to meet one of the leading ACP experts on foreign policy, Turkish MEP Suat Kiniclioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a jumbled ride along the tracks, which reminded the ancient rhythms of the famous Night Mail document, I arrived in the Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for the secular state, which wants to turn my backs on its Ottoman past.
However, with its well-known Islamic roots, the ACP is presenting a shift in the paradigm of the Turkish consensus.
In the West, she raised suspicions, especially in Washington.
Taxi brought me to the main state of ACP, ultra-modern stone and metal building, deliberately built on a growing suburb, surrounded by half-deconstructed commercial houses and merchants to power where middle managers in business clothes - both men and women - meet to do early morning trades.
Suat Kiniclioglu could well be a central policy of almost any other European political party.
Saka, tie, I'm sure Blackberry had one too.
"The aim of the foreign policy of the party is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate surroundings.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he told me.
Turkey has been cut off from its perimeter.
Today he must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
Must have done both.
"But surely a moment will come," I asked, "when may Turkey have to decide?"
"Turek," he said, "didn't wish that such a decision had to be made."
He then stressed that almost everyone I spoke to in this room said almost every memory: Turkish relations not only with the Middle East but also with the Caucasus and the surrounding Black Sea are for the benefit of Europe and the United States as well as Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, follow these tracks east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back to Hydarpas, after most of the night, I was thinking about the two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who were watching this building build a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be if they found that European ambitions in the Middle East could now be, from a substantial part, in Turkish hands.
And when I waited at the port for a ferry back through Bospor, I remembered that in those days, Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least then there were not many doubts which the continent should be entitled to on this fascinating country.
Memorable lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As a Guildford musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrolog, September 11th) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir.
As part of the district music plan, he founded a year for this excellent young Proteus congregation.
He was about 21 years old, but when Proteus last sang in 1979, several of us were almost 30 - we simply refused to give up the congregation.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shapeshifter) represented the willingness and ability of the congregation to play any music that was presented to it - whether madrigals or Messiaen, either alone or with the entire orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young congregation was often overwhelming, always exciting, all thanks to the inspiration of the only man and the enthusiasm for music that remained completely constant all the time.
How often only Todd told us to "let the music speak for ourselves".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
So sing it!"
His tactical technique was absolutely clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor Mayan.
Wherever the music was, he always picked him up.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor was to match the knight, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades, when he conducted the Guildford Philharomenic from 1962 to 1982.
In the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed with any of them - and I have been inspired many times.
Todd Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, according to his words, simply "touched around the world one or two leaky furnaces".
Many of us will be missing.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary, William Woodruff (September 25th) claims that "in 1946 he returned to the economic history of Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... and also studied at BSc, MA and PhD."
This comes from Woodruff's notes by the author at Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953, he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and then completed dissertation work at the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and then published it in 1958 as a publication of the British rubber industry.
He actually spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and summer 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he finally left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It's not known why Woodruff went through this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resina "Flamenco and Life" because his documentary black and white photos are amazing.
I was immersed by the simplicity and strength of the charge with which it affects the viewers, and by the consideration and respect of the photographers.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
"Resina can capture magical moments."
The Honda attack with its best seller for the second time.
In November, Honda will start selling the second generation model Jazz.
If the predecessor of this one-spatial vehicle has already had considerable space, he now offers even more spacious interiors.
This involves improved engines that increase driving comfort and allow more fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view, the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes on this one-spatial vehicle.
It is necessary to mention, for example, innovative design, new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Before we examine the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes to the market six years after the introduction of the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing we notice is that Honda needed a shorter period than other producers to cool this model.
Although jazz is a less-known model in Europe, it has become a phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case with Japan, where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also during this year 2008.
Almost a million pieces have been sold since the release of Honda Jazz in Japan.
The second market became an old continent with approximately half a million pieces sold in six years.
However, the Honda aims to increase sales in its category by the new Jazz.
So while in 2007, this Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Honda Jazz units, in 2009 estimates are made of 100,000 cars, which would mean an increase of 17% in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, since 2002, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 pieces of Jazz, representing 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
With regard to the new generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects the sale of 2,000 pieces throughout the year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly ease the decline in sales in Spain.
Car management thus de facto expects the year to end with a total number of 22,000 sold pieces, which means 4,000 less than in 2007 and a 16% drop.
Despite this increase in sales, the Honda increased its share in the Spanish market to 1,8 %, compared to 1,6 % last year.
In 2010, this Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the success of its next new model.
It is Honda Insight, a five-door hybrid with a compact size of 4.37 meters, from which Japan’s company promises worldwide sales of approximately 200,000 pieces a year.
As far as the markets are concerned, the Japanese producer estimates that 50% of Insight will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the old continent and Japan.
The launch of the sale of Honda Insight is expected in the first months of the next year, as soon as the public is presented in January in Valencia.
Unlike the first generation, all dimensions increased in the new Jazz.
Its length has increased to 3.9 meters (by 5 centimeters more), width to 1.69 meters (by two inches more) and speed of axles to 2.5 meters, which means an extension of five centimeters.
On the contrary, the height has not changed and is still 1,52 meters.
Increasing the dimensions has also increased the inner space.
However, this advantage was achieved by using the new platform, but by storing the fuel tank in the middle of the car, which was already used for the previous Honda Jazz.
Also the volume of luggage space - which has a double bottom system - has increased to 399 litres, by 19 litres more than the volume of luggage space of the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur on the version with engine 1.4, as the volume of luggage space at Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Another improvement in addition to external elements - such as rear LED lights or the possibility of equipment with a panoramic roof - is easier access to rear seats.
Door leading to the second row of seats allows the opening angle of 80 degrees opposite 67 for the first Jazz model.
For the second generation of Honda Jazz, there are new engines.
From the beginning, this small model will be offered with two petrol engines 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines are using i-VTEC technology, which allows lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and brings excellent improvements in the propulsion system while at a high torque in full engine speed.
The first motor with a volume of 1.2 litres has 90 horses at 6,000 speeds with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 speeds.
This engine - which at the previous generation of the car Jazz 78 horses - has a consumption of 5.3 liters and an emission of 125 grams CO2.
Unlike the previous engine, which was 83 horses in the previous generation, it will now be 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 horses has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams CO2.
"Auto bee" prevents precipitation
To progress in the development of technologies to protect against accidents, Nissan was this time inspired in nature, specifically by bees.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes the role of bee flying, thus preventing precipitation.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in precipitation prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Centre for Technical Progress of Nissan Motor Co. robotics developed in collaboration with the Centre for Progress in Scientific and Technological Research the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhir Doie, director general of public relations for technology, research and brand development, BR23C is presented as an extension of the four zones of the Nissan security shield.
Robot is tasked with strengthening the ability to prevent precipitation in the vehicles of this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is very similar to the Nissan security shield.
Most important, however, are composite bee eyes that can be seen in all directions at a angle of more than 300 degrees, which allows the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
In creating this visual function, engineers proposed what they called a laser localizer (Laser Range Finder).
It records obstacles that are located up to a distance of two meters in a 180 degree radius before BR23C, calculates the distance of the object in question and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which will immediately transfer it to warning of the collision.
"The moment the obstacle is recorded, the robot will imitate the bee's movements and immediately change direction by turning the wheels to the right or even greater angle to prevent the collision.
The greatest difference from any existing system is the fact that all evasive maneuvers are entirely instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to respond quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the robot cannot move upwards and downwards or diagonally, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and to a direction that allows its wheels to rotate, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities like bees.
Therefore, in addition to speeding up and slowing down, Nissan also used the rotation function to prevent the robot from crashing.
"The device only needs to process the information every few seconds and to behave according to this data.
It does not require retaining information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, which can work without interrupting with just two dozen kB memories.
It may surprise you, but we're not talking about a gig or a mega."
This is the first step in developing new technologies to immediately prevent precipitation, a technology in which Nissan predicts the use of serial cars in ten years.
Robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion.
Another possible future use of this technology could be to build a unit into a GPS satellite navigation system that would lead the driver into the target and avoid obstacles on the road.
Enjoy the fear before you take the mortgage.
It should be recognised that, in addition to having sufficient capital to distribute injections, the U.S. Treasury does not lack ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risks with banks with doubtful solvency, it created a popular-scientific game on the Internet "Bad Credit Hotel".
Or "The Hotel of Bad Loans"... or a mixed hotel.
The hotel and its receptionists in particular look grim to think once, twice and three times about whether it is the right moment to ask for a loan.
And especially where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is, the game contains useful information, although not very detailed.
It's a site that's more suitable for young people than a space for the whole public.
And what happens when the game is over?
There's a dream room inside the hotel.
Well, at least something, because I'd rather not talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley is opening his capital MUFG
Morgan Stanley's banking house reported that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank that spends nine billion dollars to get 21% of its capital, and the adoption of this report led to a significant decline in its exchange rate.
A week after they discovered their preliminary agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was planning to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's current stock at a single dollar of $25.25, representing a total turnover of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19 % lower than the book value of the securities by 31 August.
MUFG invests another $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities, which will provide it with 10% return and whose exchange price is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the whole operation would be carried out on the basis of the average uniform price of $29, i.e. 28% under its current course.
Morgan Stanley's shares, however, lost 6.79% and reached $23.07 around 17.00 in greenwich time.
"This strategic merger represents an important opportunity to speed up Morgan Stanley's transition to banking status," explained John Mack, director general of this American group.
The new statute was adopted by Morgan Stanley last week, which is intended to allow him to diversify his activities, but it also places him under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Its merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest essay from Wall Street to take a much more cautious approach than before.
The conditions presented on Monday show, among other things, that the agreement has been amended over the last few days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japanese people for approximately $8.5 billion.
"Just a week ago we thought," explained Mizuno, Executive Director of MUFG, in Tokyo, "that our participation will consist exclusively of ordinary shares.
However, given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to limit the risks to the minimum and also to cover ourselves."
On the basis of the weighted average price, the MUFG will pay Morgan Stanley 7 % less than their book value.
And the operation will result in a reduction of share profit by about 20%.
The agreement assumes that the MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in one year if the latter will be rescheduled for a certain period of time at a price of 50% exceeding the exchange price, i.e. about $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that MUFG brings will allow him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his cash flow.
However, the speaking groups refused to provide precise information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following the investment, Morgan Stanley should boast the Tier One ratio of about 15%, which is one of the best in the sector.
Morgan pointed out that he had reduced his balance from the end of August.
The past weeks have been difficult for the group, because its exchange rate has fallen by half, while the insurance costs against the risk of non-payment associated with the debt have risen sharply.
These costs were reversed on Monday, but remained high, about 12 %.
Last week she announced Goldman Sachs, the only other survivor from the big Wall Street investment banks after the break of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the Merrill Lynch buy-in that she picked $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
To re-establish the Republic around socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuela Hugo Chávez, Bolivia's Eva Morales and Ecuador's Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third person appointed to vote, following the example of his relatives and friends, proposed a new Constitution.
And its mission is accomplished, because 64% of the voters, according to official results covering 80% of the votes, voted in the 'yes' referendum.
"No" according to these results obtained 28 %, 7 % of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the ballots were empty.
In order for the Constitution to be adopted, he had to obtain half the votes plus one.
Two polls conducted in the eastern part of the election room and the count of the non-governmental organization predicted on Sunday a clear "yes" victory, with 63 % to 70 %.
Rafael Correa insisted on winning his constitutional proposal on Sunday night.
"The Constitution has won the whole line," assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians at Guayaquil Governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
He understands himself that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chávez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote that took place in a calm manner, according to the observer mission of the Organization of States of America (OEA), related to the text of 444 points which were "new socialism" promoted by the president.
The proposal of the Constitution dedicates the power of the State over the economy by favouring it with the "planning of development" of a country that mainly lives on oil mining by foreign companies and from the foreign exchange that send its expatriates.
The proposal endorsed by Correa, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the Head of State, which will be able to carry out two consecutive four-year mandates and be able to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that it will exercise this power and will apply for a new mandate in February 2009.
Among other things, the Constitution strengthens the principle of free health care and education, which the president began to introduce in the country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also includes a ban on the presence of foreign troops, ending an agreement between Washington and Quit on the use of the Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American drug operations.
19 hostages released in Chad
The Egyptian commando attacked 11 tourists and their eight - member escorts who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held in captivity in the desert for ten days, were alive on Monday and transported to the Egyptian capital.
During the morning, Chad freed the Egyptian commando.
The hostages arrived around 15:30, clearly in good form, on board a special aircraft on the al-Maza military base, just adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred without being able to express themselves in the press, on board a helicopter to a hospital in Maadi, the district residential district of Cairo, to be subjected to medical examinations there.
"They are completely ill" and "no ransom payments were paid to the kidnappers", said Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garran at the airport on the road.
Since its captivity on 19 September during the safari in a vehicle with the propulsion of all four wheels at the foot of Mount Uanat, at the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages were dragged from one hideout to the other 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border director of the Agency Aegyptus, the organizers of safari.
A leader of Egyptian security forces indicated that 30 members of special forces approaching the site on board two helicopters went to the skeletal during the night just before dawn.
"There was a shootout, half the kidnappers were killed and the others fled," said this source, which wished to remain anonymous.
He indicated that a total of 150 Egyptian special forces from the "light" unit were sent to Sudan, where they received support from the German and Italian command teams.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini was mentioned from Belgrade, where he is currently located, by secret agents and Italian special forces.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the people of our secret services, by special forces," he said without further clarification.
He also denied that the ransom would be paid.
In the evening before, the Sudanese army declared that the four-wheel drive vehicle on which the kidnappers were on board had been detained while patrolling, with six of them killed, including the Chadian commander and two arrested.
The army claimed that they were connected to a group of rebels in Darfur, the Movement for the Liberation of Sudan - Unite (SLA-U), which immediately rejected the movement.
Letters - Quiet majority of cultural resort
The debate on the financing of culture is full of newspaper headlines and is a topic of the ongoing campaign.
That's better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise to search for poor sums that are provided to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, and national memorial sites that are starving?
Which politicians dare to remind the federal government that they will forget their monuments and their historical buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have laws that actually protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to the restoration of a mere Chinon castle in the Loira Valley?
For our American neighbours it is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all regional organizations, in cooperation.
In Québek, at the Québek History Association, at least 40,000 volunteers from the history, monuments, archives and genealogy companies are seeking to unveil history, to preserve a collection of private archives and to protect archaeological remains for a few small ones.
Often these companies are guarding the dogs of our monuments, which are hopelessly protested by the promoters and the leaders of the activators to release their bulldozers on the old stones and forgotten cemeterys.
When do we finally meet the Tributes of History and Monuments?
Benelux governments the county of Fortis bank
The Benelux States will help the Belgian-Holland Bank Fortis, which was the first to get into trouble in Europe due to the widespread impact of the Americas mortgage market crisis, with a partial withdrawal of EUR 11.2 billion in support of the three countries' monetary and insurance institutions, which also has capital participation in Hungary.
This weekend was agreed at the highest level by the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments, with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Fortis is the first in the euro area, which, in the context of the international financial market crisis, has been spreading in waves for more than a year, has reached a major crisis, and the decisions made in this case could be considered as precedents in a certain way.
In the sense of the decision that was born on Sunday night, all three states will purchase almost half (49 percent) of the bank’s assets there.
The bank will sell a portion of its capital participation with complete certainty, especially - mainly insurance - activities purchased in the last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
The shares of Fortis Bank began to decline sharply last week, in the second half of the week, serious signs of the crisis have already emerged in the constitution.
However, analysts agree that the bank is too large to let its 85,000 employees fail.
Company securities fell by only 12 percent on Friday, to a 14-year minimum.
The value of shares has fallen by more than two thirds since January.
However, given the current stock prices, the group's overall market capital value is around EUR 14 billion, according to the company's leaders it is unrealistic.
The management of the company is, in fact, guilty of the collapse of the Fortis stock of uncertainty on the overseas market in connection with the adoption of an US package plan worth $700 billion.
There's been a slight stock hike on Monday.
On Friday, the new CEO, Filip Dierckx, was appointed to head the bank.
Even private buyers have been looking for the monetary institution, but no one has submitted a more serious offer so far.
The Belgian Government has announced earlier that investors do not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
There's still no panic among the bank's clients, and the branch office hasn't been attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and also bought several leasing companies.
The fox in the hen
Life and health insurance companies in America, based on people's data on the purchase of drugs, often refuse to enter into an insurance contract with the applicant.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme which binds the use of drug prescribing data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
He must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we trust a fox hen," quotes Washington Post Richard Dick, the author of a drug-prescription program.
Insurance companies shall make insurance companies and amounts paid in case of insurance events depending on the health status of the applicants and, if the risk is assessed as too large, they shall not close the insurance with it.
They used to send the medical examinations concerned and only concluded the contract when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick came up with a much cheaper procedure: based on the customer identification number of the pharmacists, it is easy to find out what drugs he bought in the last year and a half, from which the program himself derives from, what disease he suffers and what his condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys a large amount of cholesterol-reducing medicines, this suggests that he has virtually uncontrollable high blood fat levels, which immediately puts him in a higher risk category.
In circulation there are several versions of the program, some also determine the risk coefficient, so there is almost no work left in the insurance sector, although small difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include that Lecter medicines can be used for several purposes, for example, some compounds are used against migraines or hot flushes, but they are also effective against depression.
These represent a significant risk-increasing factor from the point of view of commercial insurance undertakings, although the problems first identified are not significant.
In order to request and process the data, specific companies were created which, before they could obtain the necessary information from the pharmacists, would request the patient's permission.
To this end, the authorities are already under pressure, even though they have not been punished for their current negligence.
Some companies have recently also processed the results of laboratory examinations that link with the data on medicines used, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the medical condition of patients.
Data is increasingly accessed by companies, while controlling their use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a specific Act on the protection of health data, but its effectiveness applies only to health service providers and insurance companies.
The proposal for a law which gives the authorities the power to control data-specific undertakings is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: that is why he has developed his program so that the data transfer is tied to the express consent of the person concerned.
The other thing is that the consent in question can hardly be denied, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him.
So the chickens are only somewhat denouncing the fox of good will.
Global Marseille Menu
The European Union and India will double the turnover of trade
Since the European Union and India are the leading trading partners, this theme has led alongside others, mainly global problems, also the ninth-level meeting agenda at the highest level.
Today there will also be a French-Indian summit, which will focus on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union recognises that India is a developing democratic power that should be given a greater opportunity to speak on international issues, but it has not yet been possible for Member States to find a common denominator in the question of supporting New Delhi's permanent membership in the UN Security Council.
This question was thus not further discussed at the ninth summit held in Marseille last night.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as current President of the Union, respectfully President José Manuel Barroso of the European Commission and High Representative for Foreign Policy Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed to double the turnover of trade within five years, or increase to more than one hundred billion euros.
Since between 2000 and 2007, the exchange of goods has risen from 25 billion to 55 billion, it is not an overly ambitious objective.
Twenty-six existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation have been brought into line with this in legal terms, so that it has also been given a green light into future air transport.
By the end of 2009, India and the Union would like to sign a free trade agreement.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is among the EU's partners in the ninth place.
Summit also focused on a global issue.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, respecting terrorism, both sides condemned in all its forms and called for an urgent convening of a UN conference.
They also settled the end of the Dauga business cycle, although both have a large share in its present failure.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate programme, namely that it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20 per cent by 2020.
India also agreed, as would the need for the next year's climate conference to conclude a global agreement and the production of gases causing the greenhouse effect to reduce by 50 percent by 2050.
Both parties would also like to prevent rising food prices and to support the convening of an international conference to address the financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Prime Minister is coming to the French capital, where a bilateral meeting is about to close a deal on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
Paris believes that the investment of 20 billion euros in Indian nuclear reactors will be acquired by French companies.
According to the Agency’s reports, the Agreement should be valid for 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Large participation by Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of Buchmes, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International Frankfurt Book Fair expects over seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred different countries to take 171,790 square metres of the fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see with Turkey as an honorable guest.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government at the Italian Pavilion inaugural ceremony: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – at 264 square metres of exhibition area.
It will be followed by a press meeting at Room Struktur Buchmes in pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives regarding the state of publishing in Italy.
According to data, the importance of foreign authors' books in relation to total Italian production continues to decline, mainly due to literature for children and adults.
Found a plane called Steve Fosset, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The rest of Steve Fossett's plane was found, a millionaire who disappeared on October 3, 2007, while flying across the desert in Nevada.
Threats were discovered on one mountain plane at an altitude of 3,000 meters above sea level, in the Mammoth Lakes area of Sir Nevada, at the border between California and Nevada.
But there were no human remains inside the plane.
Sheriff Madera County, John Anderson, expressed doubts that remained: "The aircraft was found, we sent a team there, and now we are sure that this is exactly the one where Steve Fosset flew the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore made it clear that no human remains were found in either the aircraft or the surrounding area.
A 63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The U.S. Agency for Transport Safety (Ntsb) announced that several hours after the discovery of the wreckage, an investigation team was sent, which eventually identified the aircraft: it is precisely Bellancu 8kcab, missing from September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, near the Nevada border, some Fosset personal items were found one couple close to their residence in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fosset's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, money in cash and one jacket.
The Fosset's search was interrupted a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire has won a place in history thanks to the long collection of the championship.
In 2002, for the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete his journey around the world in an air balloon: two weeks alone.
Three years later, the world flew around on a plane without landing.
Among his many records are also a 15,445-meter flight above the Andes, even with a copilot.
Glk, a commercial you don't expect.
One unusual Suv with original design and precisely defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last born Glk of the "complex" jeeps of the home of the star, by which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring the news into this sector.
It is thanks to its non-traditional processing that there will be unexpected and unconventional communication, which will accompany the placing of Suv Glk on the market and which will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17th.
In this way, the advertising campaign, which will accompany the debut of the new vehicle, will also launch an unofficial way of communication thanks to the 3D futuristic poster campaign, which is used for the first time in Italy for the car brand.
Project maxi posters, broken down into three different phases, will dominate the main business class of Milan, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin by presenting a car in stereoscopic vision and using special glasses that will be distributed near Corsa Como, you will see the new Suv in almost real dimensions and in a three-dimensional format.
Indeed, when you look at the picture, you will feel the car leaving the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of the innovative technology Elumi8 the new Glk will be illuminated in various moments in all its little things to recommence itself in a single image.
Without a doubt, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical area of car communication with this advertisement.
Will he succeed in this way in raising the interest of future customers? We will see.
Now we know who the Italian hooligans are.
Trivenet, they're risking Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been following Nazionale azzurra for years and which has so far, in truth, never made excessive problems.
She's never even met a rival fan.
Group orientation's right.
Founders come from Trivenet.
Verona, Padua, Terstu, Udine.
In Sofia they were joined by groups (in fact few groups) from Campania and Puglia.
They have three-colored flags on which cities of origin of the participants appear: on Saturday evening they removed them to avoid being recognized.
They're inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found true Nazi fans, Levsky.
Figc gave the Italian fans 144 tickets to the match: all in name, i.e. easily controlled.
And Viminale actually checked them all: there was no one with the ongoing Dasle among those who went to Sofia, no one who was forbidden to visit the stadiums.
Four blue fans, who had earlier transgressions from the stadium, were denied the ticket and the game was banned.
Now Viminale waits to read the reports that will come from the Bulgarian police, then will take action: In this case it is possible to give Dapo to at least five years of fans who were arrested or who were identified during the riot.
International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer enter one stadium.
For luck.
But now there is fear of emulation: that means that more than one hundred and fifty will be added.
"We must immediately put out this fire and not justify those who act this way," the Viminal confirm.
So, "clear eyes, mostly because of the national game on Wednesday in Leča."
There's a small core of support in Puglia right now.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio meets, on Tuesday, Cass, who can count on one part of Aise, is a secret service that takes care of the problems at the stadiums.
"Corretful Leader-Lander and tense arms during Mamelie's anthem? In Bulgaria, that's not a crime."
This is the idea of Domenica Mazzilli (expressed in a really little happy way), who is the director of the Viminál Osservatoria for a few weeks (he won a place that was formerly Francesca Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzie).
Mazzilli was formerly a Quaestor in Terst, where is the core of Ultras Italia supporters founded in 2002.
It's true, as Mazzilli says, in Bulgaria it's not a crime to celebrate a leader, but of course, the behavior of these 150-200 fans is disgraceful.
"I'm not a sociologist - adds the Osservatorial refrigerator – crimes are attributed to the country in which they happened.
So far, this group has remained within limits, now we're going to take a good look at what happened and evaluate it for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistling at Mameli's anthem: it's not even a crime, but if you'll excuse me, it's rude..."
