TickTok hides inappropriate videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of which are under 18 years old
Imagine China / Reuters
The Chinese social network TikTok censored videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibet's independence, or Falungun's proscribed religious group, says The Guardian.
Documents from the publication tell us that TikTok (ByteDance company) uses the app to advance China ' s foreign policy objectives abroad.
The bulk of the violations related to China's policy are “encouragement of hatred”.
In each case, TikTok places inappropriate publications in a context suitable under general rules so that the action of the social network does not look censored.
For example, the ban on criticizing the socialist system of China falls under the general prohibition of “criticism or attacks on policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.”.
The ban on mentioning incidents in Tiananmen Square or genocide in Cambodia falls under the “telling of the history of China or other countries”.
The document also contains a list of the prohibited names of twenty “foreign leaders or public figures”, including the North Korean leaders Kim Chen Ira, Kim Ir Sena and Kim Chen Yin, the Indian policy of Mahatmu Gandhi, the American Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japan's Prime Minister Sinzo Abe, South Korean President Pak Kye, President Joko Vidodo of Indonesia and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, as set out in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
First-class publications are removed by socialist administrators and may lead to a blockage of the user.
Non-serious violations are of the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.
Representatives of ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules were obsolete and no longer applied: “We are currently using a localized approach, as well as attracting independent local experts.”
The Russian TikTok users do not have specific restrictions on publications, reports Rust Bogdanov, co-founder of the Prodüzer Centre.
"Praciusrian Center" is a Russian media company that is officially cooperating with TikTok.
All the advertising materials of the "Produsher Centre" bloggers are consistent with the social media, but user materials can be placed without any agreement, passed on to Bogdanov.
To the question of whether politics or Putin could be spoken of in TikTok, Bogdanov responded positively and said that he had seen such publications.
The founder of Our Didgital Roman Zaripov agrees with Bogdanov: “The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: you cannot express shocking content discriminating words and so on.”
But under these rules, any content that is displeased with moderators is noted by Zaripov.
Zaripov is another Russian partner, TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of its users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of which are under 18 years of age.
By user agreement, TikTok can only be used by persons over the age of 13.
Social administrators check their age by using artificial intelligence: neurosecution analyzes faces and determines how many years a person looks like, reports Bogdanov.
If neuroscientist decides that the user is younger, his account can be deleted, he adds.
According to the RBK, in September 2019 ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of Kovorkinga WeWork.

Russians Warned of False Calls From Banks
In Russia, the number of calls from fraud has increased to replace the bank's phone number.
This is reported by Kommersanto with reference to the data of the Central Bank.
In the summer of 2019, the controller transmitted to the communication operators more than 2.5 thousand telephone numbers to clients of various financial organizations.
In 189 cases, operators found a replacement number.
218 additional numbers were blocked and 59 were restricted to financial services.
The Deputy Head of the Information Security Department of CB Artem Sychev said that a large number of Russian banks had been replaced.
He explained that operators did not always respond to the Central Bank's warnings on fraud calls, referring to the absence of such an obligation in the Communications Act.
In the Open Bank, Rosbanke and Alpha Banke confirmed the increase in the number of fake calls with a replacement number.
According to the Bilayna Press Service, some of the fraud information transmitted by the CB was incorrect: the numbers actually used by banks to communicate with customers were included in the lists.
Their blocking would lead to disruptions in the organization's work.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank is planning to establish a database of fraud numbers to which the communication operator will address each call to verify the number.
He explained that such a framework would require legislative amendments.

Stoltenberg discussed with Ukraine's accession to NATO
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and President Vladimir Zelensky discussed Ukraine's membership in the alliance in the fields of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
Genecus told us about this during his presentation at Columbia University in New York.
Responding to the question of whether the topic had been raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg stated that they had indeed discussed the issue and stressed that he had not replied to the deadline for Ukraine to join NATO.
According to him, any country wishing to join the North Atlantic Alliance has a duty to meet certain conditions in order to meet specific standards, RT writes.
In Crimea, they offered a Green Alternative course to NATO
The President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelensky, should engage in good-neighbourly relations with Russia instead of a course to join NATO.
On Friday, 27 September, this was reported by the Co-Chair of the Assembly of the Slavs of the Republic of Crimea Roman Čegranets.
"The President of Ukraine does not need to repeat the predecessor's mistake, but should listen to the council [US President] Donald Trump, who has listened to the sour face and to have relations with the President of Russia," said Czech journalist RIA Novosti.
A Czech said that Zelensky was a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
He said that only if relations with the Russian Federation were established would the Ukrainian President succeed.

Money is more important than football.
Barcelona blackmails Neymar.
Spanish Barcelona and her former Brazilian footballer, Neymar, are trying to settle the financial dispute that arose after the attack on the French Paris Saint-Jerman.
The case almost reached court, but the Catalonians suggested that the player settle the dispute without femida’s intervention.
Otherwise, they refuse to return.
Niamar and his cunning father, who is also an agent of the Brazilians, had an interesting focus: in agreement with Barsa, which had been signed in 2016, he was due to receive 40 million euros.
However, literally a year later, the forward was in the "PJ" for a record €222 million.
Nevertheless, he received 22 million from the Catalonians and now wants to take the remaining 18.
In fact, Brazilian lawyers insist that the club owes him interest on the late payment.
When Neymar’s claims became known in the capital city of Catalonia, Barcelona filed a counterclaim.
Blue Borders insist that the bonus was in favour of the entire contract, from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that only a quarter of the 40 million Euro was relied on by the player and requires a return of a proportional portion of the first payment.
But the interesting thing is, in the summer of Naymar and Barsa, they almost agreed to return the prodigal player to Catalonia.
True, the deal was broken, but the hope of a reverse forward shift remains.
And so, according to Sports.Ru, referring to insiders, the club's lawyers told the players that if the issue of financial claims was not settled in pre-trial terms, it would rule out the possibility of returning the Brazilian.
Naymar himself wants to come back so badly that he asked for guarantees that the Catalonians would buy him back.

But Laar replied that the goal of the Reform Party was to obtain two seats on the Board of the Bank of Estonia, so that Andres Sutt would join the Council in addition to Jaanus Tamkivi.

Mass disturbances on three
The Moscow case against the Summer Protests is more noticeable and is losing political momentum.
Evidence of the “mass disturbances” itself does not stand the test, but in the absence of a political decision to drop the case on brakes, a weak evidentiary base would not necessarily lead to the withdrawal of charges.
The collapse of the case must inspire society, but it will certainly leave the forces in extreme irritation, whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence have proved to be in vain.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three defendants in article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass disturbances) - Alexei Minjaylo was unexpectedly released from detention without any obligation, and several hours later and completely rehabilitated: the SDR dropped the charges.
He was arrested for almost two months, followed by several professional communities: historians, priests, literaryists.
The case was followed by only two accused of mass disturbances (originally accused of 13): Sergei Fomin, who was transferred on 3 September under house arrest, and Samariddin Rajabov, who had been arrested by the previous court until the end of December (he is also accused of violence against a representative of power, art. 318).

The Ministry of Internal Affairs proposes to punish police on the Internet
The Ministry of the Interior of Russia has prepared amendments to the Police Act in order to protect the law against defamation and misrepresentation of information on the Internet.
On Friday, the Federal Legal Portal requested a public discussion of the bill and the draft document itself had not yet been published.

Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help to prolong youth?
The topic of phytoandrogens has been studied poorly.
Of the most famous, it's the dust.
The phytoestrogens have been well studied and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain diseases associated with age (including cardiovascular, certain cancers).
Known sources of phytoestrogen are all beans (most popular soybean), hops, seeds lax.
In fact, many experts believe that such BADS cannot be a full substitute for natural hormones.
It is also not possible to exclude possible harm from such additives.
In the background, for example, they may reduce the production of their own hormones by making too many analogues outside the body.

He's got a huge story and great fans.
I wish them all the best, and I believe that the authorities of the city will return their home club!" He wrote to the Instagram.

The Hydromett Centre has named faithful folk lavishes
In Russia, there are many folk primates that people are trying to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them are working.
At the Hydromett Centre, they've checked all the artifacts that they're supposed to be working on.
Meteorologists concluded that only two of them could be truly trusted, indeed, in the short term.
As scientific director of the Russian Hydromett Centre Roman Wilfand said, if the sun is red during the sunset, the next day will really be warmer, as our ancestors pointed out.
And if the celestial lights are white, the next day will be rain.
The second working note is based on bird observation.
It's more common to talk about handkerchiefs, if they're flying low, it's usually rainy.
This is explained simply by the fact that when the air humidity is high, the moisturizers moisturize the wings and the feathered feathers are forced to fall to hunt insects, the TSS writes.
On different continents, there are people's phantoms.
Surka Day is the traditional folk holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on 2 February.
It is thought that this day must be observed by a stork coming out of its burrow to determine the time of spring’s arrival.
Unrecognized oil stains found on beaches in northeastern Brazil
Oil stains of unknown origin were found on 99 beaches in north-east Brazil.
Contaminants were scattered two thousand miles [2,000 km] of the coastline.
Reports of the first found oil stains began to take place on the second of September.
Each day, however, up to Thursday, their number, as well as territorial coverage, continued to increase.
The Brazilian Institute of the Environment conducted a chemical analysis of the samples identified.
It turns out they're all identical and it's about crude oil.
In the Petrobras State Oil Corporation, which was transferred to the analysis of the found samples, it was stated that they did not correspond to the oil obtained from the Brazilian oil fields.
"It's solid oil.
It can be dropped off one of the ships after the tanks have been cleaned.
Many continue to do so.
She was most likely caught in the ocean," told the Brazilian news portal G1 the coordinator of the trade union of the oil industry in Pernambuku and Paraiba Rogerio Almeida.
He also added that, despite the ban on this practice, many ships continued to dispose of waste on the high seas.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states in the north-east, environmentalists discovered nine sea turtles covered in full oil film.
Only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Institute of the Environment, together with Petrobras, will start cleaning up contaminated beaches.
In the meantime, the Institute recommends that tourists and local residents bypass the oil spots and notify all contaminated sites.

The Russians have nothing to do with retiring - W. Matvienko.
The Speaker of the Council of the Federation, Valentina Matvienko, believes that the Russians do not have sufficient savings to fully earn a guaranteed pension product bill in the country.
The practice of increasing pension by personal savings in the world is quite widespread.
Another question is how timely it is for us to introduce it.
“In my view, a large part of the population now has incomes, of which they simply have nothing to allocate to increase pension benefits in the future”, said V. Matvienko.
The Russian speaker said that they could not understand the mechanisms for the establishment and assessment of the pension, since “the constant changes in this area have made them completely confused”.
This does not mean that I object to the improvement of the pension system governing its legislation.
“Russia is a social State, and we must do our utmost to ensure that pensions, social security for citizens are improved.
But the steps in this direction must be sound, responsible, taking into account the national realities," stated V. Matvienko “RIA Novosti”.
The head of the SF stressed that if this initiative (a guaranteed pension product bill) was to be developed, several basic principles, including volunteerism, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and strict guarantees and State responsibility for ensuring the preservation of pension savings, should be laid down.
The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced on 6 September a draft law on a guaranteed pension product (GPP).
Among its main elements are the voluntary procedure for citizens to join the savings system, guaranteeing the long-term pension savings of citizens by the State, registering the savings accounts of citizens by the central administrator, tax benefits for business and tax deductions for citizens.

Sony and Disney agreed.
The rightful owner of the picture Getty Images Image caption News of the departure of a favorite superhero from the movie-world Marvel has aroused anger among many loyal worshipers
One of the most famous comedian characters, the Spider-Man, will stay in Marvel's cinema.
Disney and Sony Pictures have been able to agree on the rights to use it in French films.
This became known from Sony press release, which states that the third part of the Human Spider with Tom Holland will be released on 16 July 2021.
It was previously reported that Disney and Sony Pictures were unable to reach a consensus on income-sharing, which would cause the Human Spider to leave Marvel.
The rules of cinema are in control of Sony.
She leased them to a movie called Marvel, which belongs to Disney.
As a result, Sony received income from the proceeds in the cinemas and Disney from souvenirs and toys.
It was reported that at some point this provision had ceased to exist, and the company wanted to review the agreement.
President Marvel Studios Kevin Fajgi said he was delighted.
It's amazing that Spidey's journey will continue in the movie house of Marvel.
"We're all very happy at Marvel Studios that we can continue working on it.
Spider-Man is a sign-up figure.
It is a hero whose history affects all generations and audiences all over the world," says his press release.
Faygi recalled that Sony was also creating its own cinema, built right around the Spider-Man.
"It so happens that he's the only super-powered superhero in a lot of movies.
So as long as Sony continues to develop its own space space space, the future can bring unexpected surprises," he said.
Tom Holland, who was playing Spider-Man in five films, apparently commenting on the news, put in his account "Instagram" a clip from the film "Walle Street" in which Leonardo de Caprio yells "I am not leaving!"
Information on company conflicts appeared in August.
According to the media, Disney wanted to receive half the cash receipts from films on Human Spider provided that both companies paid half the cost of producing paintings.
But that didn't fit Sony.
The news of the possible departure of a beloved superhero from the movie home of Marvel has aroused the anger of many loyal worshipers.
The details of the new conditions are not yet disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony refused to comment on the agreement, but stated: “We have cooperated well over the past four years, and our shared desire to continue working together has been commensurate with the wishes of many fans [Man’s Spider-Man].
We are glad that we can go forward together."
The film "Travels: Finals", which brought together the Human Spider, Tora, Halka and other superheroes Marvel, became the most caste in the history of the world cinema, mixed with the first place of the Avatara.

In press, the singer had previously explained that the artist had participated in the project in support of the International Day of Peace, which had been celebrated on 21 September, and had not changed his patriotic position.
Remind me, there's been a wave of outrage on the network.
It's called bullcraping.
How do artists who visited the occupied Crimea, who supported Putin’s policies, who unleashed a war on Donbass, where almost every day people die, can talk about peace?

The second round is just fighting, while the reception time is limited to 30 seconds.
The third round is all allowed.
When's the first rule tournament you've made up?
29 November.
In the Andercard of our fight with Cokleev.

The expert told me why you should give up tea in packages.
A team of scientists from Canada representing McGill University found that more than ten billion microplastic particles in a cup of tea would be placed in a cup in five minutes.
The packaged drinks may also be added to the particulates, said the National News Food Security Expert Elizabeth Tikhonova.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot obtain reliable information about the composition of the packaged tea - the manufacturer can add ingredients there that will not be included in the package.
The drinks don't come out at the end of the season, so they might end up in tea.
"It is not always the tea plants that are included in the packages," Tikhonova said.
She said that it would be better to give up the use of such a drink in favour of the tea on the ground that is sold in specialized stores.
In addition, she stressed that the risk of packaged tea was not only in the composition but also in the method of production - micro particles were heated to high temperatures, so that they could begin to secrete harmful substances.
“It is best to buy pure green tea or black tea, at least one supplement in such a drink,” said the expert.

Regions were invited to share business support secrets
As noted by the Parliamentary Gazette, on 27 September, the Chairman of the Federation Economic Policy Council Committee, Andrey Kutepov, addressed a letter to Maksi Oreshkin and Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov, proposing to express his position on the initiatives taken by the Federation actors to improve legislation in support of small and medium-sized entrepreneurship (SME).
It is time to establish interregional ties
The Economic Policy Council Committee of the Federation has summarized the information received from the regions on the business development and legalization programmes in place, as well as on the results of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions shared with the senators the problems of SME development and submitted proposals to improve existing legislation.
“To date, communication between regions has not been sufficient, with the lack of information on regional enterprise development programmes across the country being identified by the business community in all regions by senators,” said Andrey Kutepov.
In the annex to the letter addressed to the Government, he presented a set of positive work done by the regions on the legalization of self-employment and summary data from the regions with proposals and issues (as available).
In addition to the relevant ministries, the consolidated data from the regions are also sent to the regional executive heads.
The exchange of information on well-reached jobs in the regions could give impetus to the development of entrepreneurship in general.
The first step towards such an exchange will be to send information available to the Committee on Economic Policy”, said the Parliamentary Journal of the Senator.
Experiences That Work
Today, in many regions, small and medium-sized business support programmes have been adopted and successfully implemented.
For example, there is the Centre for Enterprise Support in the Volo annually, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in certification of finished products.
In the Ivanov area, a business support system has been developed to implement the principle of one window through multi-functional centres.
In Krasnodar region, agricultural consumer cooperatives are granted grants from the country budget.
There is a cluster development centre in the Orlov Region.
The Amur area of the federal project “Acceleration of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises” provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators established by existing non-State co-arching centres through the federal budget.
A number of other regions have special support measures for youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed Continues to Get Out of the Shadow
In the view of the regional authorities, a number of changes in existing legislation should be made to support small and medium-sized businesses more effectively.
For example, the Archangelian Region proposed to replace the term “self-employment” with “business activity” because it “is best suited to the content of the public service to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens”.
In Ivanovsk region, amendments are considered necessary to expand the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including activities related to the separation and renovation of accommodations, buildings and physical training.
The British region considers it important to strengthen the monitoring of illicit dairy producers through the Mercuria veterinary system.
In the Kostromsk and Magadan areas, social entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship support are encouraged by the legal framework.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State programmes to support small and medium-sized entrepreneurship, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of specific bills.
“All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State programmes to support small and medium-sized entrepreneurship, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills”, said Andrey Kutepov.
The airline helped the passengers avoid being next door to the crying children
Japan Airlines (JAL) launched a new function, and it is now possible to find out where small children will be sitting when they are arming their seats.
It is now possible to avoid neighbouring them if they are to be desired.

The carrier has launched a function to track where the children will sit.
When selecting seats in the lounge during reservation of tickets, passengers will be able to see a picture of the child’s head in the field, which is occupied by children from eight days to two years of age.
Thus, those who do not want to fly close to the young can be as far away from them as possible because of their possible problems of crying.
Internet users who use airline services were thrilled with the innovation.
Some of them thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.
One of the Yuzers complained that a few weeks ago he had flown from New York to Doha, and he had three crying children sitting next to him.
Another commentator suggested introducing only “adults for adults”, expressing his willingness to pay for such a flight.
Many tourists noted that they are now trying to choose Japan Airlines for their movements because they see little pleasure flying near a crying child in a closed space.

Credits to Russia fell 100 times.
In the Government of the Russian Federation, it was estimated that agricultural and food supplies to Russia from countries under the Russian food embargo had declined more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to President Vladimir Putin, 31,000 tons of goods were imported from authorized countries in the first half of 2019, compared to 3 million 442,000 tons for the same period of 2013, Interfax reported.
At the same time, the value of imported products decreased to $226.5 million from $4 billion to $975.5 million, respectively.
It is the supply of goods that have not fallen under the embargo.
As indicated in the report, the quantities of imports prohibited were offset by an increase in imports from CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia, Serbia.
Recall that, at the end of August, the Government had extended until 31 December 2020 the rules on destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which were prohibited from importing into Russia in the framework of counter-claims.
In a document on the official legal information portal, it was noted that the rules were extended for a further one year, from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
Initially, the decision to destroy the sanctions applied to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, since 13 August 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Ukraine have joined the list since 1 January 2016.
Putin's decree on the illegal destruction of sanctions (products falling under the food embargo imposed by Moscow in response to the anti-Russian sanctions of the West) entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the Government has permitted the destruction of “sanction” food in any lawful manner.
As the sanctions persisted in the West, the RF has also extended its response.
However, products imported by citizens for personal use are not subject to this measure.
The prohibition does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption up to 5 kilograms.
However, Mikhail Fedotov, President of the Russian Federation for the development of civil society and human rights, had previously referred to food destruction as “just immoral” and this, he said, had had a negative impact on the education of people.
Moreover, in early June, Roskowiadzor took the initiative to prohibit the destruction of food suitable for consumption.
A similar recommendation was made to the Government by the Human Rights Council to President RF.
And Deputy Prime Minister Alexey Gordeev said that it was wrong to destroy food, and we should think about how we can use it for our purposes by assessing quality.

Chile started building a 1 billion-euro telescope
This is reported by ATS with reference to the Press Service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
ESO reports that the construction of the E-ELT telescope (European Extreme Large Telescope) has officially started this week, while the most expensive and ambitious ground astronomical project is being carried out.
Its total cost is estimated by ESO to exceed a billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on equipment and construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-sized mirror, with a diameter of approximately 39 meters.
It will be collected from 798 hexagon segments of 1.4 metres.
This huge mirror, as well as two supporting surfaces reflecting a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, will help E-ELT to obtain the first detailed photographs of the planets outside the solar system, the stars in other galaxies, as well as the search for Earth's doppelgangers.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the vicinity of Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole in the center of Milky Way.
Despite the fact that the dome has only been built, mirrors, scientific instruments and other components of the observatory, scientists, engineers and other experts have been developing for three years since the first E-ELT plans were announced.
The main mirror contract, totalling about 400 million euros, was awarded to the German firm SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
