Semilarski v. the Procurator's Office: the cassation of former Deputy Mayor Tartu will consider 4 August
This means that it is likely to be decided in early September.
The Courts of First Instance dismissed the Semilaran lawsuit, but in April the State Court accepted the appeal.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the complainant as her authorization was not within the competence of the Administrative Court.
The court ' s order stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damage caused during criminal proceedings.
“These issues must be settled by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office and the District Court”, explained to the correspondent of the ERR Press Secretary of the Tartu Courts Annette Craittsmann.
She said that Valvo Semilarski had appealed this order to the District Court, which had not changed the first instance court ruling on 5 February.
Now, the Lord will have to say his word.
According to counsel for Semilarski, juror Oliver Neess, his client had been suspected of bribery for about two years.
He now requires the Public Prosecutor ' s Office to refute the incorrect allegations to his own address and to compensate him for the moral damage.
The complaint was brought before the court by the Prosecutor for Special Cases of the Lyon District Prosecutor Margus Gross, who had been filed by him in October 2017, when Semilarski, together with the other at that time Deputy Mayor Tartu Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of several crimes.
“Remember that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Public Prosecutor ' s Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the whole Republic of Estonia that the Tartu leaders, one of the most influential local governments, were corrupt.
These aired public suspicions accompanied me for about two years.
Now that these allegations and suspicions have been false, the prosecution does not want to talk about it," said Semilarski in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nees, at a press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the Public Prosecutor ' s Office should operate.
“The allegation of bribery and corruption has proved false, but this is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia as well as on Lithuania that during the investigation the representatives of the State must be careful when choosing words to prevent suspects from being represented as criminals before sentencing.
To this end, the Public Prosecutor's Office is also obliged to assume innocence, which, unfortunately, has not been respected in this case against Valvo Semilarski," said Nees.
“The public submission of Semilarski as a serious offender and briber in circumstances where the facts underlying suspicion of bribery are still clarified is inadmissible, which is contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the complainant”, added counsel.
As Rus.err.ee wrote, the former Deputy Mayor Tartu Walvo Semilarski would not be held liable for bribery charges - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, a former official is accused of knowingly violating anti-corruption legislation in dealing on a particularly large scale.
According to the indictment, during the period 2015 to 2017, the former Deputy Mayor Tartu participated more than thirty times in the meetings of the City Authority in the decision-making process involving the companies in Tartu, whose owners or leaders Semilarski had been actively involved at the personal level during the extra-time period.
According to Gross, in all these cases, Semilarski had personal interests and therefore had to withdraw from taking decisions.
Previously, according to Russian.err.ee, the Public Prosecutor's Office had submitted Semila's suspicions of receiving bribes and violating anti-corruption legislation in special-sized transactions.
This happened in October 2016 when he was detained with another Deputy Mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centristian Party).
At that time, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office and the Security Police stated that there was substantial evidence against both vice mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
The Suvorov case was later brought to justice, which fully justified politics.
The judicial investigation of the Valvo Semilarski case is still ongoing.

United States called upon Qatar and its neighbours to cease the dispute
Confidence and unity between Qatar and other States must be restored, according to the US Special Representative for Iran, Brian Hooke.
He stated that the conflict between the emirate and other countries of the region had lasted too long and had damaged regional interests in the areas of stability, prosperity and security.

Diplomatic relations with Qatar three years ago broke up the OAU, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain.
They set up a transport blockade, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism.
In response, in Doha, the neighbours were simply jealous of Qatar's economic successes -- according to IMF data -- Qatar has been leading GDP per capita for several years with a large gap.
Emirate is the third natural gas inventory, the sixth natural gas exporter and the largest oil and petroleum exporter.

How CB’s decision to reduce key rate will affect the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to reduce the key rate again.
It went down by a further 0.25 percentage point, to 4.25 per cent of annual, a formal historical minimum.
Based on the return of a short step towards lowering the rate, as well as the tone of the CB statements and the updated projections of the Russian economy, the regulator sees economic prospects more optimistic than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary policy mitigation can soon be halted.
“We have continued to mitigate monetary policies, especially since inflation risks remain lower than 4 per cent in 2021,” said the head of the Bank of Russia, Elvir Nabillin.
These are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, decline in domestic and external demand.
The economic recovery, according to Nabillina, will take more than a year and a half.
It noted, however, that following the lifting of the restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes were revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand had recovered, construction and production of consumer goods had increased, and annual reductions in freight turnover, production had slowed.
According to the updated CB forecast, in 2020, the economic decline would be 4.5-5.5 per cent (probably 4-6 per cent) and the recovery growth in 2021 would be 3.5-4.5 per cent and 2.5-3.5 per cent in 2022.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per Urals barrel in 2020 and 2021 respectively.
Previously, the CB was expecting $27 and $35 a barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7 to 4.2 per cent against earlier expectations of 3.8 to 4.8 per cent.
The Bank of Russia's view of the economic situation is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the mitigation cycle, according to Russian and CIS economists, the Renaissance Capital Sofia Donets and Andrey Melaschenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has consistently reduced the key rate for more than a year, and since the beginning of last summer it has dropped by 3.5 per cent.
At a previous meeting in June, the CB reduced it immediately to one percentage point due to low inflation rates due to low demand and the need to stimulate a slow pandemic and its associated economies.
The chances for monetary policy development remain (at the next meeting on 18 September and before the end of the year), but the limit is close, according to chief analyst Rosbanka Evgeny Koschelev.
The combination of pro-inflationary risks also points to the proximity of a break in interest-rate policy - the broken supply chains, the potential increase in costs due to the prevention of the epidemic and a faster (than expected) recovery of demand, he said.
In addition to follow-up, the Bank of Russia will require greater attention to inflation during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has risen against the backdrop of geopolitical conflicts, says Koschelev.
In any case, a reduction in the key rate will lead to further lower rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as possibly by mortgage, says senior economist of the “Open” analytical management of Maksim Petronević Bank.
The rate adjustment would be less pronounced than the key rate reduction, he clarified.
Credit rates may fall by an additional 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, mortgage rates may be completed annually between 6.2 and 7 per cent, and do not exclude economist Anton Pokatovic, BCS Premier.
The average rate of deposits, in his opinion, would also fall - they could drop to 4.2-4.5 per cent in the coming months (currently just above 4.5 per cent).
Then they can go down to 4% if the CB lowers the key rate in autumn, says Pokatović.
The Centralist Party pledges to pay all its debts by the end of the year

The Alliance of peasants and the Greens of Lithuania, head of the Seima ruling coalition, led the party rating.
This showed a survey conducted by the company's sociological research company Vilmarus por order from the newspaper Lietuvos ritas.

However, recently, the President of Lithuania, Gitanas Nauseda, in assessing the electorate of the parties, said that the Alliance of peasants and “greens” after the parliamentary elections this year would probably be able to re-establish a coalition.
This statement caused disdain for conservatives.
The latest survey showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 per cent of voters would vote for peasants and 17.2 per cent for conservatives.
According to the director of Vilmorus Vladas Haydis, the gap is within error, but the ruling authorities have ceased to abandon the conservatives.

Third, the Social Democratic Party, which is now ready to vote for 7.1 per cent of respondents.

Fourth, Labour Party, headed by Russian businessman Viktor Uspassky (6.2 per cent).
The remaining political organizations, according to the survey, have not yet been able to overcome a 5 per cent electoral barrier.

Excess requirements for purchase requests will be excluded by law
The legislation may establish exhaustive requirements for procurement requests.
In the autumn session of the plenary, the Gosdumas are planning to consider, on second reading, a draft law setting out the content and composition of the request for participation in a procurement to which only small and medium-sized business entities can be involved.
Amendments are made by the Government to the Law on Procurement of Goods, Works and Services by Certain Legal Persons.
The bill has been developed on the road map for the implementation of the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Strategy in the RF until 2030 approved by the Government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on the exhaustive list of documents which the contracting entities have the right to require in the composition of an application from the procurement entities of small and medium-sized enterprises.
Also, a list of the requirements for those documents.
To date, the Procurement of Goods, Works and Services of Certain Legal Persons Act regulates the procurement of certain types of legal persons.
The requirements for the content, form, layout and composition of the request for participation in the procurement are set by the purchasers themselves in the procurement documentation.
“The result is that the contracting authorities impose excessive requirements for the content, layout of the application, mandatory availability in its composition of the certificates, certificates that are comparable in the time limit for the submission of applications in the authorized authorities, thus making it impossible to participate in such procurement and reducing the number of participants in the procurement”, explains the draft law.
The new bill provides for an exhaustive list of documents that the contracting authorities are entitled to require in the composition of an application from procurement participants who are subject to small and medium-sized entrepreneurship.
“The adoption of the document will preclude the arbitrary establishment by the contracting authorities of the requirements for composition and content of applications by participants who are subject to small and medium-sized entrepreneurship”, said the explanatory note.

The head of the region instructed the Acting Minister of Agriculture to move on, examine the milk management structure, review the experience of other Territories and identify options for addressing the problem.

The authorities of Podmozkowya told of the fate of closed landfills
In Podmozkowya, solid household waste areas continue to be closed.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 landfills are being upgraded to modern treatment plants.
But this option is not possible for every polygon - many of them have grown into a dense housing structure.
Once the polygon is shut down, it rises to recovery, the body of the polygon breaks through the ground, systems for degasification and dehydration are installed.
This can stop the chemical processes inside the landfill, so that it does not ignite, debilitate, poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former dumpling remains to be raised by useless dogs in the midst of its housing structure.
Why not make it useful?
For example, in Ruza, where the regeneration of the Anino polygon had just ended in the days, the authorities were considering the option of making a mountain slope out of the heap.
This polygon, which has been operated from 1976 to 2016, has grown so far that it has gone beyond the borders of the land allocated to it.
Therefore, in the course of the rehabilitation, neighbouring sites had to be purchased, de facto long ago killed by the debris under a cap.
"Sometimes it'll pass, the polygon's going to land, and we'll get the fort, and we'll think what we can do to get him started.
"He told the journalists the head of the Ruz District of Nikolai Parfenov.
Two polygons will be areas for renewable energy production
Turbeevo polygons in Lubérce and Temohovo in the Bogo District will be sites for the production of renewable energy from solar and biological gases.
By the end of the year, the Torbeeva will have a gas-fuelling plant capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatts of electricity per year and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy that will provide its own needs -- the heat supply of administrative and manufacturing facilities.
Temohovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt hours and will continue as a waste treatment plant.
A museum may be established on the Balachino district of Kucino, which was closed after complaints by residents on the Front Line with the president of the country.
“It was such an idea to create a museum for the rehabilitation of the Podmoskowya polygons”, said the Minister for Environment and Environmental Management of Dmitry Kurakin.

Vice-Minister Furgala went to the protesters for the first time
Vrio of Governor of Khabarovy Kraj Mikhail Degtierev went to the participants for the first time after his appointment in support of the arrested ex-head of the region of Sergey Furgal.
A broadcast of the meeting took place on his Instagram page.
"Moscow hears all of them, so I sent you a poem so the region wouldn't run out of power... and I repeat about Furgal, he's my friend, "b" is a one-party, "c" is a lot of concern for his fate, "the party's helping him, handing over the food, Girinowski's knocking into all the cabinets," said the governor's vortex.
According to Degtierev, the Habarov Land cannot now be without a leader, so President Vladimir Putin has been appointed as head of the region, so that “a wonderful building (the government of the province) is functioning, everything has worked, the budget has been spent on social needs”.
Vrio of the Governor explained that he had not gone to the protesters earlier because he could not communicate with thousands of demonstrators.
He therefore broadcasts in social networks and reads all the comments on them.
On 25 July, two consecutive protests took place in Khabarovsk.
The rallies in support of the former Governor have been held in the region since 11 July.
On the eve of another action, Mikhail Degtierev said he would leave town on the day of the rally.
His courtship was stopped by protestors and called for a statement about the fate of the arrested ex-Guernator Furgal.
Degtarev had previously refused to go to shares.
"There's something to do here to actually the manager than to go out and communicate with those who scream under the windows," said the governor's vortex.

Beautiful high-rises only adorned Aya Sofia
Again on Aya Sofia, the text of Vladimir Zelinsky, which, if you ask, must be protested.
First of all, there was a free entrance - Oorah!
I haven't been to Istanbul, but God's House is better free than paid.
Secondly, Muslims conquered the land as honestly as the Orthodox conquered the Volgo Oksky internegotiations, the Muslim Caucasus (and placed the Church in Grozny) and planted apples on Mars.
God Help!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
Are we going to return everything?
Do you think there are no pagans who will need to return their cape, the place where the Tenth Church is?
Thirdly, Muslims have improved the building and invested in it.
I mean, it's the same as the mills and dwellings that the Lennuts took from the bourgeoises into their property, they belong to the Leninians, Putin and other nomenclatures.
They've improved everything from Kremlin to Angara, so that's all of them right to progress.
The beautiful tall minarets very decorated Aya-Sofia, very much.
There was a stupid nun, a stupid nun with beautiful minarets.
Fourthly, there are no Islamic and Orthodox civilizations.
Believers, there are hypocrites, there are fetters that unite faith and hypocrisy.
A believer in civilization doesn't think.
It's the thought of a British Mida Toynbee official who's so ashamed to think so.
And to the believer everywhere is a place of prayer.
Always.
The believer does not pray only where they ask him to leave, and he withdraws to another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a defender.
We're the buckets, not the stones.

The decision to expand the IDP would not be supported by WEFA or FIFA
The President of the Russian Football Union (RFF) Alexander Dukov believes that it is wrong to expand the Russian Prime Minister (RPL) to 18 teams at present.

I knew that Bryant's self-love couldn't be touched by a flutter so as not to stimulate his sport anger.

On the platform, I complimented him, "Oh!
Kobby, I've got a good one, a good one!
Listening to my excited feedback, he almost forgot that he had to take the ball in his hands once more and get three or four more points.
We've talked well with Koby," says Kirilenko, "Moving Night Moscow."
He also told about his first game against Jordan.
"I've taken care of him.
For the first three minutes of the match, I ran in total admiration for the legend that he saw only on TV with me.
As long as I'm happy to have my breath in my tooth, Michael's got a lot of points.
Soon I'd gone away from the railings, once and for a while covered his brooches...
At that game my team won, and Jordan still scored 44 points," added head RFB.

An actor in the Russian series responded to allegations of “promotion of LGBT and feminism”
The actor of the Russian series "Chiki", whose creators were accused of "promotion of LGBT and feminism", replied to claims for the film.
The authors “understand the severity of the issues raised and wish not to offend anyone”, said American Steven Thomas Oxner in an interview with the edition of “Smoke”.
"I think it's a story about the strength and general aspects of human life.
It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism," said the actor who played the boy's father, who changed into women's clothes.
He stressed that “work is prideful” and did not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he was intimidated by the reaction of some people to the storyline: for example, there was a case when “a man in a deep sweat shot the set and said that it was all false”.
"Then there were a couple of cases when we met disgruntled locals who didn't understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so the people who came with the claims first started to help us," he said.
The shooting incident explains the publication, which took place in Cabardino-Balcaria in September 2019: a drunk man attacked a vehicle of a group of guns and was subsequently detained by police officers.
It has previously been reported that the Public Commissioner for Family Protection, Olga Baranets, filed a complaint with the Ministry of Public Affairs and Rossomnadzor for service of more.tv, which placed the Russian series "Chiki".
Baranets accused the creators of the series of "promotional non-traditional sexual relations and feminism", noting that the main heroes of the film are prostitutes, and the series itself contains "stages of physical and psychological violence".
The ombudsman also resented the fact that “a lot of attention has been given in the series to homosexual sexual orientation” of a minor.
Chiki's comedy drama tells of three prostitutes who started a new life and opened a business on the advice of a friend.
