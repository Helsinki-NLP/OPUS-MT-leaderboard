Valiant extra deputies are concerned about what looks like puppets.
Some Deputies do not understand why their democratic status should be changed to "member of Parliament of Wales".
The Deputies failed because of plans to change the name of the local east to the name "Parliament Wales".
The MPs of all political opinions suggest it's an accident.
One deputator said that his colleagues were concerned that it rhymed with the words 'stupid' and 'donkey'.
For readers outside of Wales: In valiant twp means 'stupid' and pwp means 'don'treme'.
She said that her group was completely displeased and offered an alternative.
The Valiant Conservatives said their group was ready to discuss the change in the name of the East, but noted that it was a short word transition from a member of the Valiant Parliament to a "marinet".
In this sense a Valiangese letter is pronounced in the same way as the English-speaking words of the letter u.
The Assembly's commission, which is currently drafting a draft law on substantiation of changes to name, made a statement: “The final decision, by any description of what eastern deputies call, will, of course, be the question of the members themselves”.
The Law of State of Wales of 2017 gives the Welsh East the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a national consultation on proposals for wide support to call it the Parliament of Wales.
As for the title of the additional deputate, the Commission preferred Members of Parliament, Wales or the HR, but the EP's decision received the greatest support during public consultations.
Some other Deputies are obviously offering alternative options, but the way to reach a consensus can be a headache for an elder, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill of change for a few weeks.
Reform commands will also include other changes in their personal work, such as the rules on disqualification of additional deputies and changes in the structure of their department.
Some other deputies will hold a final vote on what they should be called when they're doing their job.
Macedonians are moving on a referendum after a change in country name
On Sunday, voters voted in favour of changing their country's names to or against the Republic of North Macedonia.
The national vote was organised to resolve a multi-annual issue with a neighbouring Greece, which has its own area under the name of Macedonia.
In Athens, it's been a long time since their northern neighbour's name has been a claim on their territory, which has prevented Macedonia from turning on and on in the Northern Atlantic Alliance.
President George Ivanov of Macedonia, a referendum worker for a change of name, said he would not take part in the voting.
But the referendum adherents, including Prime Minister Zoran Zae, claim that change in name is just the cost to be paid for entering the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
Called the Temple of St. Martin conspiring, the Churches of Harlem fighting for existence
"There was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today it's neither."
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People have different attitudes and facts at present," he said.
"Bars are no longer comfortable local living rooms, where people walk constantly."
As to the church, he was concerned that the money from the sale of acts did not stop for as long a period as the leaders expected it, and sooner or later they would come back to where they had started.
The churches," he added, "may be replaced by the dwelling houses with the candames, filled with people, who will not help the temples which will stay in the neighbourhood.
"The overwhelming majority of the residents who buy candidatures in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore it accelerates the day when these churches shut up together, because it is unlikely that the majority of the people who move into these candidams will be members of these churches."
Both churches were built with a bunch of whites before Harlem became a black neighbourhood -- the Church of the Static City in 1870 -- the Church of St. Martin's in a decade's time.
Initial white methodic abscess came out in the 1930s.
The black area which was drawn to the vicinity got the property right for the building.
St. Martin's Church was fascinated by a globular citizen who was led by a passing John Howard Johnson, who had decreed a boycott of merchants on a major trade in Harlem 125th Street, where they refused to hire or sell a blacksmith.
The fire in 1939 had left the building severely damaged, but the believers in the direction of Johnson's Island planned a reconstruction: they had entered into operation by the brougham.
Like David Johnson, the son of Johnson's father, and his successor to St. Martin's Church, proudly called the brougham "the names of the poor people".
The expert who played the karillion in the cast called it "Cultural Treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical tool".
The expert, Cifani Ng, from Michigan University, also noted that this was the first in the world to be the world's carillion, at which player Dionysio A. Lind played a blacksmith, who 18 years ago moved to a larger broth in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Maryvenger said that in St. Martin's Church he was not replaced.
What has happened in the Church of St. Martin in the last few months has been a complicated story between architects and traitors, some of whom have been attracted by the untrue Church leaders, and others by the diocese.
The horsemen's east, driving the organ of the coming, consisting of the captain's assistants, wrote in an eparchy in the eparchy, with the caution that the diocese "trys to translate the expenses" into the horsemen's east, although the East was not involved in the hiring of architects and subcontractors whom the diocese had sent.
Some arrivals complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
The shark injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for fishing lobbyists in California.
On Saturday, the shark struck and injured a 13-year-old boy who hunted Lobsters in California on the day of opening the season to catch lobbyists.
The attack took place about 7 o'clock in the morning at the beach Bacon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that Saturday afternoon he was engaged in dawinga with his friends for half an hour when he heard the boy scream for help, and then sailed with the others to help him out of the water.
At first, he thought it was just an excitement from catching a lobbystar, but then he realized something bad was happening, 'I've been bitten!
I've been bitten!"
"The whole key of his was torn," said Hamel, adding that he noticed it when he walked up to the boy.
And I called out to everyone to come out of the water, "In the water next to the shark!" said Hamel.
The boy was transported in air to Raydie's children's hospital in San Diego, where he's in critical condition.
The intelligence of the shark, which made the attack, is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles' rescuer stated to the brifing media that the shark had been observed in this place a few weeks earlier, but it was decided that this was a secure species.
Giles added that the victims received injuries from the upper torso.
The officers closed their approaches to the Pont Beach beach in Casablanca to Swami in Esinitas for 48 hours to conduct the investigation and for safety.
Giles pointed out that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's planning to move on British beauty market
Sainsbury's going to work with Boots, Super Two, and Debenhams, opening department with beauty stores in the university where trained specialists will work.
As a large advance to the UK beauty market is projected at 2.8 billion pounds of sterling that continues to grow, while the volume of sales of fashion clothes and domestic goods decreases, larger beauty ladies will be represented in 11 salons across the country and also in other new salons next year that demonstrate success.
The investment in beauty comes because supermarkets are looking for a way to fill a place on shelves that used to be occupied by television sets, microwave ovens, and house stores.
Sainsbury's said it would double the volume of beauty goods, offering up to 3,000 products, including brandys like Revlon, Essie, Tweizerman and Dr. PawPaw, which would appear first.
There's an appeal from the L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also be given more room in business departments as well as what can be found in such shops as Boots.
Big stores also restart their Boutique makeup ruler, so most products will fit the vegans, and this course becomes increasingly demanded among young buyers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop's perfume shop will test a concession in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in the south of London, and the second is opened in Sali-Ouk (Birmingham) at the end of this year.
Shopping on the Internet and going to buy a small amount of food every day in local shops around the house leads to the fact that supermarkets have to do more work to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Cooper, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that trading points would be more and more similar to the University because the supermarkets network is trying to compete with Aldi's distributors, Lidl, using a lot of services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's placed the trading points of Argos in hundreds of shops, and arranged several dots of Habitats since the time that two years ago acquired both networks, that, in his words, contributed to the increase in the sale of food products and made the acquisition of more profitable.
Previous attempt at supermarkets to reconstruct their beauty and optics failed successfully.
Sainsbury's protested a compulsive venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but an attempt to split the income from the optical shop ended after a number of deliberations on supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's three years ago sold her aesthetic business together with 281 Celesio's owner of Lloyds Pharmacy's optical network for 125 million pounds sterling.
It was stated that Lloyds played his role in this respect by expanding the range of luxury brandys by caring for the skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said, "We've changed the look of our beauty salons to improve conditions for our customers.
We also invested in teaching our employees how to offer their recommendations.
Our brand assortment designed according to all needs, and attractive equipment and comfortable accommodation make us the best home of beauty that resists the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones settled down after Holly Willowby gave up the deal by 11 million pounds sterling.
The Star of Dragons Den Peter Jones settled down after the audience of Holly Wilbby gave up 11 million pounds sterling with his brand, specializing in the image of life, to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Uley doesn't have time for a brand of goods for Truly's house and accessories.
The business of a couple became like a brand of Guinean Peltra Goop.
This morning a 37-year-old teller announced to the Instagram that she was going away.
Holly Wilby left Dragon's Den Peter Jones, who is now splitting up with his profitable business of creating brandy clothes to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources report that Jones was settled when a "golden" television girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlowe, that her new stakes of up to 1.5 million pounds sterling meant that she would no longer have time to do domestic goods and accessories of Brand Truly.
The business was like a Guinean Peltra's Goop brand and was doubled to double the well-being of Wilube's 11 million pounds sterling.
When 37-year-old Willy announced to Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew away from Great Britain and headed for one of her home vacations.
The source reported: Truly was Holly's main priority.
It turned out to be her long-term future, which she saw in a couple of decades.
Her decision to refuse had left all the participants absolutely stunned.
No one wanted to believe in what was going on Tuesday, very quickly it had to start dinner.
There's a warehouse at Marlow's headquarters, full of goods ready to be sold.
The experts suggest that the seat of the leading This Morning, which comes into the number of the most significant British stars, can cost millions of companies because of huge investments in different goods, from pillows and candles to clothes and domestic goods, and also because of the possible further delay in their operations.
And this could mean the end of a long friendship.
Danny's mother-in-law, and Dan Baldwin's husband, were close to Jones and his wife, Tarai Cap, for ten years.
Uvalby founded Truly & Capp in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined the mayor's post in March.
The couple rests together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in a Baldwin TV firm.
So if you look at this, we're going to end up replacing McPentlin as the leading ITV, and I'm going to be the famous brand representative, and you're going to swap this with M&S. And you're going to swap this McPentlin as the famous ITV.
Last night a source close to Jones announced, "We will not comment on his affairs."
And I was like, "Well, after all, that's what we fell in love with."
He scrambling over criticisms which he received from means of mass information for his comments, which he considered to be "non-presidential" for speaking positively of a North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump giving up a lot of things?
The Trump said in a friendly "disclosure" voice.
"I'm not giving up on anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first meeting in June in Singapore had been announced by Trump as a great step towards denuclearization by North Korea.
But the speeches for the denuclearization had come to an impasse.
Three months later, after the June summit in Singapore, a leading diplomat from North Korea, Lee Eon-Ho, declared to the world leader at the AAN General Assembly on Saturday, that the United States of America did not wait for the "correspondences" to respond to the previous move by North Korea in the field of consultation.
Instead, he noted, the US continues to apply the sanctions directed at maintaining pressure.
The Trump has taken a much more optimistic position in your speech.
"We are very successful in building an alliance with North Korea," he said.
"Everything could have ended in a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a good deal."
He said that his efforts to improve his contact with Kim brought positive results: the completion of rocket trials, the help in releasing the hostages, and the return of the remains of the American military home.
And he defended his extraordinary approach in the conversation about Kim's relationship.
"It's very easy to be on the side of the president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded arena, we'll have about 200 people already," said Trump, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunamis and the earthquake in Indonesia have ravaged the islands, killed hundreds of people.
For example, after the Lamboc earthquake, the foreign failed organizations said they were unnecessary.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of the Lamboc population have been resettled, no national disaster has been announced, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it was realized that they were not turning to international help, so it was a little difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Home Save the Children Foundation and collects a team to travel to the Pole until it is clear whether foreign employees can work on their seats.
Mr. Sutopo, the representative of the national disaster management agency, said that Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in the field to see if the international agency would be allowed to assist.
Despite the earthquakes, which always survives Indonesia, the country is still well prepared for the surprises of nature.
While in the hearth there were built shelters, at the other shore-towns there were almost none.
An obvious lack of sulphur for warning of the tsunamis in Paul's led to a large number of victims, though a warning was.
Even in the best times, moving between many islands of Indonesia has been a difficult task.
And the resilient disasters made it difficult for us to move around.
The hospital vessel, which was stationed on the w. Earthquake for the treatment of the victim, is approaching Palu, but the path to the new place of disaster will take at least three days.
President Joe Odeda has set up his pre-election campaign to improve the decommissioned infrastructure of Indonesia and has spent money on motor vehicles and railways.
But the lack of funding is the holdup of the Jok administration because next year there will be new elections.
Mr. Joe also comes under the pressure of prolonged interfaith tension in Indonesia, where Muslim majority representatives take more conservative Islam.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows, and shots and other cold weapons.

The Parliamentary statue of Cromwell has become the last monumental blow to the matter of “writing history”.
His edition would be poetic justice for him to be like the Taliban destruction of many cultural and religious artefacts of England by his fanatic Puritan followers.
"But Cromwell's Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "foolishness" and "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, said: In the course of the present debate about the demoralization of the statue, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's monument to the Westminster Palace would become the object of these acts.
The occupation of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps poor Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestors, Thomas, in the previous century.
The strong representation of Mr. William Ham Tornicroft on Cromwell is a testimony to the thought of the 19th century and to the hysteria of an act which, as many believe, must be honored.
Mr. Goldsmith stated The Sunday Telegraph: "There are so many people who know better from the end of the 19th century than today, as parliament's defender from external pressure, in his case it was a monarchy.
Is that a perfectly precise submission, subject of lengthy historical debate.
There is no doubt that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century formed the following development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual identification figure, which represents one of the sides of this encounter.
His achievements as a lord-protector also deserve to be celebrated and honored by them."
A killing pig was killed by a Chinese farmer.
As reported by local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in southwestern China.
"The man who knows only by name – Yuan, was found dead with torn arteries and inflamed blood, beside the loaves on the Lupanshei market in the provinces of the Guineas," the South China Post reported Sunday.
The swine was preparing to introduce a pig's vaccine into the Sininese province of Tsinhai on 30 May 2005.
He is reportedly along with his cousin on Wednesday came from the neighbouring province of Yunnan to sell 15 piglets on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and saw that the door in the neighbouring pighouse opened.
He said that in his journal there was a large mustache with blood on it.
According to the report, medical forensics confirmed that the farmer's 550-pound office had decommissioned the farmer.
"My cousin's feet were covered and damaged," said the cousin with the exclamation Wu (as the citation Guyyang Evening News).
A surveillance video showed that Yuan went to the market on Thursday at 04:40 to feed his piglets.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager reported the Evening News that the pig was shut down to prevent an attack on anyone else, while the police collected evidence at the scene.
According to the reports, the Yuan family and the administration of the market will negotiate compensation for his death.
Although pigs are attacking people, they're rare, but they've been before.
So, in 2016 a pig was attacked by a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in serious injuries to a man.
Ten years before a pig weighs £650, a valiant farmer pressed it to his tractor and held it until his wife gave it away.
After a farmer from Oregon had been eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a triggering raven.
"They're just playful.
They're curvy and very curious... they don't want to hurt anybody.
You just have to give them a proper amount of respect," he said.
The remains of the Roza hurricane will bring heavy snowfall to the south-west of the United States.
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weaker because it's moving over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the near future, Roza will bring in a flood in northern Mexico and in the south-west of the United States.
The speed of the Rose, the hurricane of the 1 category, was 85 million per hour at 5 o'clock in the morning, leading to Eastern Time on Sunday, and it was recorded 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
'The Rose' is expected to move on north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, across the Pacific, the ocean starts to shape the area of low pressure, which is moving east, to the western U.S. coast. When on Monday the Rose nears the peninsula of Lower California is like a tropical storm, it starts to push the deep tropical moisture down to the north, to the southwest of the U.S.
On Monday, the Rose will bring in some parts of Mexico to 10 inches of precipitation.
Then the tropical moisture, which interacts with the emerging area of low pressure, will in the next few days cause strong lions in the southwest.
Places from 1 to 4 inches of precipitation cause dangerous sudden floods, selenium floods, and possible amnesia in the desert.
Deep tropical dampness will result in the number of habitats reaching 2-3 inches per hour, particularly in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas of north-west, particularly in most parts of Arizona, we expect from 2 to 4 inches of precipitation.
Because of the grouped portions of the tropical rainforest, a possible sudden flood may occur when the conditions are worsened rapidly.
It would be extremely undesirable to walk out into the desert on account of the possibility of threats to tropical rainfalls.
The heavy rain may lead to the land becoming a stormy river, and the rain will be accompanied by ravaged wind and dust.
The incoming area of low pressure will bring heavy rain to the coast of South California.
There may be more than half a dozen sad falls that can lead to a slight stream of garbage and make a slippery path.
This will be the first left in the rain season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin at the end of Sunday and at the beginning of Monday, before the rain goes anywhere at the end of Monday and on Tuesday.
Heavy rain will be spread in the 4th district on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October may observe a severe temperature fluctuation in the United States, as the Arctic is getting colder, but the Tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes it leads to a sharp change in temperature in the near future.
There's a good example of a sharp temperature fluctuation in the middle of the United States on a Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Amahay (Nebraska), St. Louis and De Moinem (Ayowa State), the temperature difference is nearly 20 degrees.
For the next few days, continuing summer heat will try to tighten and expand again.
It is expected that in many central and eastern states the United States will start a warm turn at 80 degrees temperature, from South plains to North-East.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees to the Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows the high probability of higher temperatures in the eastern US to the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavana listen.
Over 20 million people on six television networks watched an interesting demonstration of Thursday's witnesses in the Supreme Court in a case involving Brett Cavanaugh and Christine Blaise Ford, who accused him of sexual violence, which was supposed to have taken place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, a political opposition persists, and the winners interrupted their regular programs for the benefit of the extraordinary news Friday: a guess developed by the Arizona Senator Jeff Flaycam for the FBI: it consisted in conducting a week of prosecutions.
The Ford told the Senate Court Bureau that she was 100 percent sure that the drunks of Cavanaugh grabbed her and tried to pull her clothes off at a high school dinner.
Cavanaugh, in his keen testimony, said that 100% sure he didn't.
It is likely that over 20.4 million people, of whom Nielsen reported on Friday, were watching it.
The company counted the average number of viewers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available for other networks which showed it including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen has often had problems with rating people watching TV at offices.
To compare: the size of an audience is the same as playing a play-off or an Oscar prize.
"The Fox News Channel, whose experts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, ruled by an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day," said Nielsen, in a campaign.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
"CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million," said Nielsen.
The curiosity remained high and after the hearing.
Flake was the main figure of the drama on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican published the statement that it would vote in support of the Cavanaugh, it was captured by CNN and CBS on Friday morning, when the protestors shouted at his address and when he tried to get up on the lift at the hearing at the Court Chamber.
He stood with his drab eyes for a few minutes when he was barked, and it was broadcast live on the CNN channel.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
'Do you think he's telling the truth of the country?'
He was told, "You have power, but a lot of women are deprived of it."
Blake said his office published the application, and reported before the elevator closed that he still had something to say at the hearings in the department.
All cable and bridal networks for several hours led by a straight broadcast, when the Judicial Committee had to vote on the matter of selection of Kavan's candidature at the Senate quorum.
But Flake said he would do it, just realizing that the FBI is considering accusing a candidate next week, to which democratics from the number of minorities call for it.
Flake was convinced by some conversation with his friend, Senator Democrat Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kuns and several Flake senators, they made a decision.
Voltage Flaka had the power, because it was obvious that there would be no votes in the Republic to confirm the Kauna without investigation.
President Trump has started an indictment investigation against Kavanaugh at the FBI.
British Prime Minister Mei charges criticism of "game in politics" because of bristice
During the interview it was the Sunday Times that Prime Minister Teresa May accused her of leaving the European Union of playing politics with the future of Britain and of fueling national interests.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain, Terres May, came to the Conference of the Conservative Party in British Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
One of the interviews with her on the first shelf of the newspaper was by her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, who spoke against her so-called "welcome" plan for brilliance, stating that the proposal to the Great Britain and the EC had one fare was "just ridiculous".
Wade Simms murder: The police arrested the suspect in death of an LSU player named Stephen Simpson.
The police arrested a suspected mortal shot at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana University.
"Diatheon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and imprisoned for second-degree murder," reported the Baton-Rouge police leadership.
The officers showed videos of the shooting between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the raid.
"The police took the glasses from the scene and said that Simpsana's DNA was found on them," said WAFB, CBS branch.
After questioning Simpson the police said he confessed to the death shot at Wade.
"The cost of the facility is set at $350,000," says Advocate.
The next implementation of East Baton-Rouge was published on Friday in the previous report, in which it is said that the cause of death is an agile wound to the head and neck.
A department of an operating group of Louisiana State Police, a state police crime lab, South University Police Department to ask the residents for help in an arrest investigation.
Competition director of Louisiana University, Joe Aleva, thanked the law-enforcement authorities of the district for their “prevention and commitment to justice”.
Simsu was only 20 years old.
Attacking an increase of 6 feet grew up in Button Rose, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the Louisiana University team.
In the middle of the last season, he recruited 5.6 points, 2.6 selections per game.
On Friday morning, a coach at the Louisiana University basketball team, Will Wade said that the team was "desecrated" and "was shocked" by Wade's death.
"That's what I always worry about," said Wade.
Vulcan spews ashes in Mexico City
Ashes that erupted in the volcano of Papacatpetl reached the southern outskirts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for the Warning of Stylish Disasters on Saturday offered to the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater had become active and 183 incidents of gas and ash had been recorded for 24 hours.
In the middle there was audible rumble and a sense of jolt.
Images in social networks have shown that there are thin layers of populous crevices in the vicinity of Mexico, like Sochimlika, that are covered with car windscreens.
The geophysics noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 km) from the northeast of the centrifugal steel after the 7.1 magnetium earthquake in the central part of Mexico in September 2017.
Vulcan, known as Don Goya, has been active since 1994.
Meeting the police with the Catalan Separatists on the eve of a non-independence anniversary
Saturday in Barcelona, six people were arrested after independence supporters met with police on the street in public order, and thousands others joined the demonstration in the appointment of the first anniversary of the polarization campaign by the separation of Catalonia.
A group of surveyors in masks that were suppressed by police officers in public order threw their eggs in and bloomed in steaming paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Later that very day the brawls broke out, when the police used their clubs to restrain the demonstrators.
Over the course of a few hours, a group of independence fighters, who have been chanting 'Don't forget, don't don't don't don't, faced with the presence of professional actors who shouted 'Live of Spain'.
According to local press reports, fourteen people received treatment from minor injuries in the course of a protest.
The tension in the region, which seeks independence, remains high a year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid declared illegal, but which marked the separatist Catalonians.
The selectors mostly distanced the preference for independence, although the turns of voters were low, which was largely explained by the fables of voice.
According to data from the Catalan authorities, there were almost 1,000 people wounded in the summer, after the police tried to stop voting in polling stations all over the region as a result of the actions of angry demonstrators.
The independent groups spent the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the Spanish national police.
The demonstration went on, but the protesters were forced to go another way.
68-year-old Narcisse Termes, an electrician who is present at a separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer hopes for Catalonia's independence.
"We had one of the best times last year.
I saw my parents cry out for joy when they could vote, but we are now tired," he said.
Despite life's important but small victory for regional elections in December of last year, the Catalonian parties, who are in favour of independence, tried hard to maintain momentum this year with many of their most famous leaders, and found themselves either in a welcome exile or in exile, awaiting trial for organizing a referendum and the next announcement of independence.
A 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Pouch, who writes protest in support of the police on the phone, said that the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting harder and harder," he said.
On Saturday, Arioel Junkeras, one of the nine Catalonian leaders who have been in SIS since the end of last year, announced that they will participate in elections in the European Parliament next year.
"Exclusion as a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regress of democratic values and reprisals that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Landry: Men arrested after being billed home on the car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after their car repeatedly crashed into a house in London.
The incident took place in the district of Belliniard-Credent on Thursday, about 7:30 p.m. in British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said that the gate and the building themselves had been damaged.
Perhaps at some point a bullet was fired at the car.
As a result of this beating, Lingstan has won the Rangers against 1:0.
The first goal of the fate of Mangui for the benefit of Livingstone assured them of victory
The success of Livingstone was astounded by Rangers, and that was enough to appoint Stephen Gerard after his several contests in 18 games for the seat of the Ibrox club manager.
The impact of Dolly Mengui was remarkable, because Harry Holt's raised himself to one level with the Hibernians in the second division.
Gerard's team at this season won't win a premiere and next Sunday's team will meet the leaders, the Harts team, who stand by eight points.
Prior to that, Rangers in the League of Europe takes on Thursday Vienna's Rapid.
Livingstone, meanwhile, continued his playing series in the division to six games, and Chief Coach Holt still suffered a failure after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone misses a chance because of the rough visitors
The Holt team had to warn them long before they killed, but the Rangers called for many different problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but lost his chance of killing at the gate, after which Alan Litgo could only direct his efforts wider to meet the blow of Craig Halket.
The landlords were glad to let the Rangers play ahead of them, knowing they might bother a visitor at some point.
And that's how the goal was achieved.
Rangers gave a fine shot, and Livingstone worked the debate out, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined together to overcome the Mengoes, who had made it fit and killed from the middle of the field.
So far, Rangers has dominated, but it turns out that the team's defense is inadequate, and Liam Callie's collar has been practically unactivated.
And so it went on and on in the second half, though Alfred Marelas had actually saved Calleigh.
The ball from Scott Pittman was shot by the Rangers' Bracket Alan McGregar, and the Litgos had far moved away from the second Lingstan set.
The swords were constantly caught at the Lebanese Gate and were beaten, while the two demands of the penny were fought, after which Halket was summoned to replace Glen Middleton, and the demand for punishment for the hand game were rejected.
"Penomen" from "Lewingstan" – Analysis
Journalist for BBC Scotland Alesdeir Lamant on Arena Tony Macaroni
Phenomenal productivity and results for Livingstone.
For men they were wonderful, continuing beyond expectations on this ascendant track.
Their style of play and composition have practically not changed since they returned to the higher level, but should pay tribute to Holt for the way he has stimulated the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hulkett was grand, building up a well-organized defense, while the Menga kept Conor Goldsan and Joe Warall everywhere in the field.
Rangers didn't get any inspiration.
The kind of good that they were at Gerard's they didn't comply with that standard.
In the last match they didn't own, only once killing at a gate, which had something like a disturbing bell for Rangers, which ended up in the middle of the list.
Joining Erdogan in Cologne
Saturday, September 29, we saw smiles and felt groundless lethargic when leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of theverse visit of President Erdagan to Germany which is directed at restoring the relationship between the Allies to NATO.
They fought because of the problems with human rights, freedom of press and entry of Turkey into the EC.
Erdogan headed to Cologne to open a new gigantic sword.
The largest number of people living in the city is outside Turkey.
The police had run into safety to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from getting ready before the sword, but a great deal of supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds protesting against Erdagan, many of whom were Kurds, also made their judgment condemning both Erdagan's politics and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
They're protesting for and against reflect the discords on a guest that some German Turks have announced as a hero, while others are sued as an autocrat.
DTZ in Deptford: Ravarys died on collision with the car
Ravarist died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near crossing the streets of Beestud Street and Evelyn Street, a brisk road in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, about 10:15 a.m. in British time.
The driver had stopped, had come medical workers, but the man had died on the spot.
The accident took place months after the other cyclist had died as a result of a collision on Childers Street, about a mile from the place of the Saturday crash.
The permanent police said that their employees were working to save the man and report him to their next cousin.
Around that place there are road gardens and bus stops, and the car driver was recommended to avoid this region.
Long-Lartine Tour: Six employees injured during riots
"Six prison officials have been injured as a result of riots in a prison of the strict men's regime," reports the Penitentiary Implementation.
The misfits broke out at the Long Lartin prison in Wooster about 9:30 p.m. on Sunday, and they continue on the road.
A special group called "Tarnada" was drawn to fight the riots in which eight prisoners are part of one wing.
There was a slight trauma to the experience of the employees.
A staff member of the Penitentiary Service said, "The special-trained coaches have been directed to combat those who have committed riots at Long Latin prison.
Six employees were treated after retrieval of the injuries.
We will not take violence into our prisons and realize that the perpetrators will be transferred to the police and can spend more time behind bars."
The Royal Lung Latin prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the leader of the prison was undergoing a medical treatment in the hospital after the prisoner had been attacked.
And in October of last year, police officers in the security forces were summoned to prison to deal with a serious riot, during which workers were subjected to an attack with swords for the Waterpole.
Hurricane Rosa threatens the city of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City strong floods (which could be useful for drylands)
Trapian enemies rarely live in Arizona, but that's exactly what might happen at the beginning of the next week, because the Roses have traces of the south-west desert that pose a risk of sudden floods.
The national meteorological service already published on Monday and Tuesday data on emergency floods in western Arizona and in south and east Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Roza's Tuesday will go a straight way through Phoenix, approaching the rain on Monday.
The Phoenician National Meteorological Service observed in Twitter that only “ten of the tropical Cyclides brought a tropical storm or a fall of pressure within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the state of Arizona.”
The last model of the National Center of Hurricanes predicts precipitation from 2 to 4 inches in individual places, with it at a level of 6 inches in the Magalion district of Arizona.
In other areas of south-west deserts, including central rocky mountains and the Great Basin, it's likely that between 1 and 2 inches is likely to work, with these individual beneficial values which can reach 4 inches.
For those who are beyond the risk of sudden flood, hurricane “Rose” might be long overdue because their region suffers from drought.
While the flood is a very serious problem, some of these precipitations will probably be useful, as droughts are currently observed in the southwest.
According to the American Drought Monitoring Agency, at least a little over 40 percent of the territory of Arizona survives the extreme drought of another category," saysweather.com.
First, Hurricane Roza's path leads to a resemblance to the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
On a Sunday morning, Roza still had the power of a hurricane with a maximum wind of 85 miles an hour and 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and moving north at 12 miles an hour.
The storm collides with more cold waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore sighs.
Thus, it is expected that in Mexico a tropical storm will come out the river from the shores day or night on Monday.
Precipitation in many parts of Mexico can be strong, creating a considerable risk of drowning.
"There is a total number of precipitations ranging from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to Northwestern Sunny, where there are possible precipitation to 10 inches," saysweather.com.
Then the rose would be moving north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of the Arizona early in the morning into the Tuesday as a tropical fall of the pressure, which then would continue the movement through Arizona and the southern part of Utah state to the evening of the Tuesday.
"The real danger is expected from Rosa or her remains, it's very heavy rain in Lower California and the north-west of Santora and South-west desert in the US," the National Centre of Hurricanes reported.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life-threatening and sudden floods and migratory streams and landslides in the mountainous region.
Attacking at Midsamer Norton: four attempts to arrest the assassins
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old body with a dozen glaring wounds in Summersette.
Three teenage boys were found wounded in the Terrassexier neighbourhood in Midsomer Norton for about 4 hours on Saturday.
He was placed in a hospital where he remained in a "steady" state.
"A 17-year-old boy and both, 18 and 20 years old, were arrested at night in Redstock, Avon and Summers," the police said.
The police turned to everyone who could have any evidence on the cell phone what had happened to make progress in their search for it.
'Cavano is suffering from the depravity and anger of the Democratic Party',' said Trump.
"The voice for Judge Cavanaugh is a voice for the abolition of the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump on the rally in Wiling, eastern Virginia.
Trump stated that the Cavanaugh process of being selected by the Democratic Party is “suffered from depravity and anger”.
Kavano gave the messages to Cangress on Thursday, intensely and emotionally denying the charges of Christina Blacey Ford for sexually molesting her for decades when they were still teenagers.
The Ford also gave indications during the hearing of her accusation.
On Saturday, the president stated that "in this day the Americans saw a brilliant, qualitative and manly character" of Cavanaugh.
"The voice in the support of Judge Kavano is a voice for one of the most perfect experts in the field of law in our time, a lawyer with a wonderful history of state service," he declared a crowd of supporters of Western Virginia.
The president summarily referred to Kavano 's selection by talking about the importance of Republican appearance in the period of intermediate elections.
"Five weeks has left till one of the most important choices of our time.
I'm not just late, but I'm really late," he answered.
"That's why I'm everywhere fighting for big candidates."
It's a disaster that Democrats intend to "compile and hinder".
"It is expected that the first key procedural vote on the Senate level after the selection will take place no later than Friday," said CNN, the senior assistant to Parliament's leadership.
Hundreds of people have died as a result of the earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia, the number of people affected is increasing.
"At least 384 people died, and many people disappeared as a result of the flood of gigantic waves on the beaches, when a violent earthquake and a tsunami began on the Indonesian island of Sulavia," said the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beaches of Palu on Friday, when waves of six metres high (18 feet) fought about the shore in twilight, killing many before death and destroying everything in their way.
After that, 7.5 Magnitude earthquakes hit the tsunami.
"When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still on the beach and they didn't run away right away, and they became victims," said a briefing at Jakarta's press secretary at the Indonesian disaster eradication agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
"The tunnels pulled the cars, the logs, the houses, striking everything about the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had gone through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (up to 497 miles/h) before the impact of the shoreline.
He said that some people survived just because they climbed trees to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 downtown Palu.
Aeroplanes, published by the Agency for Wildlife, showed that a lot of buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were spinning and lounging, and the sword was surrounded by water.
The following jolts continued to climb the suburbs on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes took place in the city with a population of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for Indonesia's Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy released as a result of a strong earthquake on Friday, about 200 times the capacity of an atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to his data, the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow cove, could increase the size of the tsunami.
The eel has called the damage 'large' and has reported that thousands of houses, hospitals, trade centers and hostels are destroyed.
He said that the whole of some victims were found under wreckage of destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 had been missing without a wedding.
"Avengers and harm may be larger along the coastline of 300 km (190 m) north of Palu, a area called Dongala, which is closer to an earthquake epicentre," said Nugroh.
The link in Dongala was "completely damaged," said Nugroh.
"There are over 300,000 people residing," said the Red Cross, adding that its employees and volunteers had been directed to the affected neighborhoods.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agencies were widely disconcerted for not reporting the tsunamis in Paul's, but the officials stated that the waves came at the time when the warnings were made.
In amateur photos published on social networks, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building with a desperate shout for people in the street warning of coming tsunamis.
In a few minutes the water wall fell onto the shore, dragging its buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not at once confirm the authenticity of the downloaded material.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a serious power cut, which disrupted communication around Paula, so the authorities found it difficult to guess the rescue actions.
According to the authorities, soldiers began to direct cargo planes with Jakarta and other towns, but evacuated still very much needed food and other items of first need.
The city's airport was opened only to show help and to be shut down before October.
On Sunday, President Joe Vida planned to visit the evacuation centre in Palu.
There were more than 800 people killed in Indonesia as a result of the tsunami.
It's very bad.
"While the World Vision employees from Danggala were successfully reaching out to the town of Paul, where the workers hid in the tarpaulin shelters set up at the yard of their office, along the road they saw the scene of desolation," said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they had seen a lot of broken houses," he answered.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups started gloomy actions on the basis of disaster relief mechanisms, some people complained that foreign workers with deep news were prevented from going to Palu.
According to the Indonesian rule, financing, supplies and human beings can only begin to do so if the disaster is declared a zone of national distress.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster on a provincial level," said Alia Arriani, a journalist for the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government says, "Okay, this is a national catastrophe," we can open up for international assistance, but that's not the status yet.
On the second night in Palo, after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, friends and family of disappeared without a vestige hoped that their close wonders would be among those who would leave the unhappiness plotting lines of undisturbed misery.
On Saturday the little boy was ousted from the sewer.
On Sunday the rescuers released a woman who had been under ruins for two days, and next to her was the body of her child.
Gendon Subandon, a coach of the Indonesian national team for paraplaneism, prepared two of the missing paraplanes for the Asia Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi, including the others who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, were his students.
"As the oldest in the branch of paraplaneism I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Hendon said that a few hours after the paraplanetarians in the community distributed news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel, he desperately sent messages to the Palu member of whatsApp who were at the beach festivals.
His messages, however, were marked by a single grey branch, not by two blue ones.
"It means that messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 during the bombing of the Newports on Levy
"On Friday, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brynka employee who founded bills at a bank in Newport, Newport, Libya," reports the Newport police department's press release.
"The driver of the machine used to rent a bankat in the amusement complex and was preparing to deliver more money," wrote Det. Dennis McCarthy in a release.
While he was busy, another man's 'fleeing from the employee of the Brink' and stole a fur with the money intended for delivery.
According to the report, witnesses noticed some suspects who had left the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their faces must contact the NYPD on the phone.
Kaney West: Reper has changed his name to Ye ("Ti").
Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Having announced a change in the name of Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "I look officially known as Kaney West."
A West with 41 years of age, by the name of Ye, was using that name as its eighth album, which came out in June.
The changes take place on the front of his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to start his new Yandhi album.
He replaces Aryan Grande's singer with a show that turned down for "empathetic reasons," said the show creator.
There was also a reduction in his current professional name, the West before that word said it had a religious value to him.
I believe that "ye" is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it's "tay," said the West earlier this year, discussing the name of the album, with the famous Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, we're you.
It went from Kaney, which means "the ones," to "the ones," which is a reflection of our good, our bad, our messiness, everything.
Album is more like who we are.
He's one of the most famous repertoires that changed his name.
Sean Combs was in a way known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his way back to Love and Brother Love.
There was also Weste's associate, Jay-Z, who did it without a link and with the capital letters.
AMLO in Mexico promises not to use an army against peaceful inhabitants
The elected President of Mexico, Andrés, Manuel López, Abrador, has never used military force against the civilian population, as the country is approaching the age of 50 from the day of the bloody newspaper against the students.
On Saturday, on the square of Tlatelolco Plaza López Abrador the Pobiets "never use the Vaisits to divide the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, the military launched a peaceful demonstration on the square, resulting in the death of about 300 people, while the left student movements took place throughout Latin America.
Lopez Abrador gibbies support young Mexicans, issuing monthly grants to learners, thus opening more free places at state universities.
"The work and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups," he said.
The US has to double funding for machine intelligence.
"As China becomes increasingly active in the field of machine intelligence, the United States must double the amount that they spend on research in this field," says the investor and specialist in Kai Fu Lee's machine intelligence working on Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
Comments appeared after various parts of the United States made statements about MI even if the United States did not have an official MI strategy.
Meanwhile, in the past year, China had presented its plan: by 2030 it was seeking to be the first in the branch of MI innovation.
"The double budgeting of research in the MI area would be a good thing, considering that all other countries are lagging behind the US, and we're waiting for the next breakthrough in the MI area," said Lee.
"Double finance can double the probability that the next great achievement of Ml will be achieved in the US," said Lee at CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book, "The State of Machine Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", was published this month by Haughton Mifflin Harkurt, is the principal executive director of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most famous MI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie-Melano, he worked on a machine intelligence system that won over the highest-ranking American player at Athel, and later he was the head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese distribution of Google to China.
I took note of a previous U.S. government technology competition, such as the Agency's front-end research project in the field of defence, and asked if it would be next to help determine the following windows:
"The US researcher has often had a lot of work to do to get state grants," said Lee.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders; it's corporations," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies in recent years have been recruiting lights from universities to work on MIs.
Lee said that changing immigration policy could also help the US to reinforce its efforts in the field of machine intelligence (MI).
"I think green cards should automatically be offered as a candidate in the MI branch," he said.
China's July 2017 government council released a plan to develop the machine intelligence of the next generation.
"China's National Science Foundation provides funding to people in educational institutions, as is the case with the National Science Fund and other government institutions making money for US researchers, but with the quality of academic work in China below," said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defence Ministry created a unified Centre of Machine Intelligence, where partners from industry and scientific circles are to be involved, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Department of Machine Intelligence.
And this month, an Agency for research in the defence branch announced a $2 billion investment project called AI Next.
As for the National Science Organisation (NSF), it currently invests over $100 million in research into MI per year.
Meanwhile, the U.S. occupation that was trying to create the Commission of National Safety with Machine Intelligence has failed to monitor what happened for months.
Macedonians claim to have their country name changed
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to change their name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which will allow them to settle a ten-year dispute with Greece, which blocked applications for participation in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which my province of Macedonia, states that her northern neighbour's name represents a claim on her territory, and has vetoed NATO and the EC.
In June both governments concluded a deal with the proposed new name, but nationalist workers claim that these changes undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slav population.
The president, George Ivanov, said he would not vote on the referendum, and the boycott company questioned whether the voters would act to meet the minimum of 50 percent needed to conduct the referendum.
The question of advertising on the referendum is, "You're a member of NATO and EC with the consent of the Greeks."
Name changers, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaewal, claim to be the cost to be paid for reception in bodies such as EC and NATO Macedonia, one of the countries that came after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they could live freely under the guidance of the European Union, because it means a more secure life for all of us," said Oliver Georgiewska, 79 years old, Skopje.
While that is not a legally binding force, enough members of parliament have said that they will take account of the consequences of voting to make it decisive.
Change your name will take more than two thirds of a parliament.
The polling commission said that there was no report before 1 hour of the day on the breaches.
However, the figure was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old voters in Skopje's capital, José Tanevski.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaew, his wife Zarica and his son Shower voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia, dedicated to the change in the name of the country that opens the way for her to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
Before parliament's building in Skopje, Vladimir the Quadrards, 54 years old, prepared a small stage and laid chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We're for NATO and the EU, but we want to connect with raised heads, not through service doors," the Cavalry said.
"We are a poor country, but we have the honour.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, for example China and Russia, and become a part of the Eurasian integration."
The Prime Minister has announced that NATO friends will make the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be 'for', because over 80 percent of our citizens support EC and NATO," said the Borrowing after the voting.
He said that the result of yes is that we're going to be confirmed by our future.
In a survey published on last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies, it is said that the referendum will take place from 30 to 43 percent of the voters below the required figure.
Another survey carried out by Macedonian television said 57 percent of those surveyed who were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they were "yes".
To succeed in the referendum, the specimen must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum will be the first major blow to the politics of the interim government since its arrival in May of last year.
Look, Sergio Aguire from Manchester City is passing to the gate through all defenses of Britain.
On Saturday, Sergio Aguier and Rahim Sterling solved the problem of protecting from Braitan by winning Manchester City with 2: 0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
For the 65th minute auguer had easily done so.
Argentine assault got a belt in the middle of the field.
He was running between three British defence officers before hitting the open field.
Then Aguerre appeared among the four green shirts.
He walked round one defender and pipped some more on the edge of the British field.
Then he pushed the trigger onto the left flank, finding Sterling.
English attacking the first touch of the fine gave Aguire's ball, which used his right kick to bypass Brittany's Matthew Ryan to hit the right side of the network.
"Avery has some problems with her feet," said the journalist, the head of Pep Guardiola.
"We talked about the way he played for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It is fortunate that he killed the goal at the same moment."
But it was Sirling that gave Sky Blues the first advantage in fighting in the Primer-lise.
This goal occurred for the 29th minute.
Aguire received this ball in the depths of Brittany's territory.
He sent a beautiful ball through the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sein had made a few points before Sterling could reach the far-off track.
Sey Blaze was attacking the net before he jumped over the line.

The server wants to play the role of the "election points" against the Rocky
After the Nationals had been shut down from competition in the playoff, there was no special reason to formalise a new start.
But he's constantly competing, and he's hoping to take a stab Sunday against "The Rockies," but only when there's still the consequences of a playoff for Rocky who stays in the leadership after one game from Los Angeles Dodgers in the West.
The years have subdued, at least, a clear place with the winning number 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still hope to get their first title in the division.
"Even though we're playing just so at least we can deal with the situation, knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team, will come together so that the game is likely to be at the highest level of all I've faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete with this?
The Nationals has not yet announced a start on Sunday, but it is reported that they are inclined to give the Governor the ball in such a situation.
The sheriff, who was going to do his 34th start, Thursday spent a session with the KPZ and will be on his regular rest Sunday.

Trump speaks in West Virginia
The president summarized himself up for a situation around his election to be the Supreme Court of Breta Cavanaugh, referring to the importance of the Republicans' appearance in the intermediate elections.
"All we've done is under threat in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not late, but I'm really late, so I'm fighting everywhere for big candidates," he said.
The Trump continued: 'You see this awful, awful radical group of Democrats going on, you see that it's happening now.
And they're determined to regain their power using any means necessary, you see, meanness, annihilation.
They don't care who they're covering for who they need to stop to get power and control, it's what they want, it's power and control that we're not going to turn over."
He said that Democrats intended "to resist and hinder".
'And you see it in the last four days,' he said, calling the Democrats 'evil, vile, otherwise and false.'
He was sent back to the Senate Court Bureau for the former recognition of Senator Diana Feynstein's Democratic Group, who received a high score from the audience.
'Remember her answer?
You accepted the document place?
Uh, what.
No, I don't expect--it was a very bad nonverbal language--the worst language I have ever seen."
Job is no longer the foundation of a church.
It's an impatience to those who express their judgment
When activists in my local party voted for being wounded, it was hardly a surprise.
Finally, I – the last of a series of Members of Parliament -- from a Labour party they say is that we are not welcome -- all to express their opinion.
My colleagues in Parliament, Joan Ryan, had received a similar feedback because she was decisively opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship was disconcerting me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, about the irony of fate, is of such questions as Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In a meeting held on Friday by the Nottingham Eastern Labour Party, it is said that "we want these meetings to be representative and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Labour Party, it was Friday that such a meeting was held.
Unfortunately, to-day's meeting the tone is not such and the promise "a nicer, softer" policy has long been forgotten if really ever had been.
This becomes increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate different views, and every assumption is judged from that point of view, it is prime for party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, because the colleagues I had previously believed to share the same political views, began to expect me to take a step back, and took a position I hadn't mentioned were national security issues or the EU market alone.
Every time I speak publicly -- and that doesn't matter what I say -- in social networks there's a bunch of insults in which they call for the cancellation of elections, condemning the politics of the centre, saying that I'm no longer in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am fortunate to have more than one of my colleagues, for the comments directed at me are generally political.
I'm delighted by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who daily encounter a stream of sexual or racist acts, but never do.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of the level of abuse.
Jeremy Corbin last week said that the Labour Party had to develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're no longer an organization that takes different views, and with every movement of uncertainty, or by changing the rules of selection, the party becomes stronger.
For the last two years I have been given lots of advice, which has called me not to fall by the spirits, not to be so loud, and then with me everything will be all right.
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since then, as I joined the Labourers 32 years ago as a school student involved in the mistreatment of the government of Tetcher, because of which my student at school was wrong, I have tried to resist the best public service for those who most of them need it -- let it be a local resident or government minister.
I have never concealed my political views, including previous choices.
No one in Eastern Nottingham could get entangled in my political positions and spaces of conflict with present guidance.
For those who fought for this movement on Friday, I would like to say that, when a country is headed towards Brexit, which is sorry for the household, for the ventures and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not Nottingham Momentum, it's my voters, it's going to be members of the lobbyists, or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise you, that no threat to cancel elections will prevent me from acting in the interests of all of you.

Ira Melrows 38 - 17: Invincible Ira at the top
Two late attempts may have canceled the final result, but, doubtless, Air deserved a triumph in that curiously interesting match of the Prime Minister Tennet's.
Now they're launching a tour table, one side out of ten.
After all, it was their highest defence, just as their best chances had made their masters, coach Peter Merci Merch had the full right to be satisfied.
"We have still tried our game so far, and we are still invincible, so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Christie from Melrows said, "Give back your duel to Eyre, he has dared more than we have.
Andersana's 14-minute attempt, turned by Fraser Clem, placed Ira in the foreground, but a yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, won for the Warriors game, allowed Melrows to juggle with numbers, and Jason Baggott grabbed an unrealized attempt.
The climate stretched out the air's leadership with the help of a penny, before, right into a break, he killed, and then made a solo attempt by making a 17-5 air in a break.
But Melrows had a good start in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, turned into a bogotham, reduced the delay to five points.
Then there was a long delay because of the serious trauma of Ruard Not, which had been extended, and after a re-start of Air moved on through an attempt by Stafford McDowell, implemented by the Climates.
Air, under Captain Blair McPherson's duties, received a yellow card, and again Melrows forced another man to pay through an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of February.
But the landlords came back, and when Struan Hatchinson got a yellow card for having knocked out the Klim without a ball with a line of fine fines, McFerson landed behind the Air.
Klimmy carried out his attempt to do it again almost after a restart, after Kyle Row had got David Armstrong punched in a fine and sent Gregor's flank to the fifth attempt on the field masters.
Star Still Game looks like it's ready for a new career in a restaurant business
However, the star of the Ford Kieran game is going to enter the hospitality business after it turns out that it was designated by the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jake Jarvis in a popular BBC show he writes, and takes pictures with a long-time comedian partner Greg Hemfil.
Duet announced that the next nine series would be the last in a series of shows, and that Karen seems to plan to move on after Craig.
According to official records, it's director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the source Scottish Sun suggested that Kernan hoped to take part in "a flourishing trade in Glasgow".
Morus ours: Bolivia, which has no way out to the sea, hopes the court reopens the way to the Pacific
The sailors are patrolling the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Citizens' buildings under the blue flag.
In the Navy-based bases from the Titikak River to the Amazon, the "Mora's Right" motto is drawn.
And what we do here is our responsibility.
In the whole of Bolivia, which has no way out to the sea, remember the coastline that Chili had lost in a blood-thirsty conflict because of the 19th century's resources, is still alive -- as is the desire to swim again across the Pacific.
These hopes may have reached the maximum peak in the past decade, because Bolivia is waiting for the international court to decide by October 1st after five years of discussion.
"Bolivia has the impulse, the spirit of loneliness and serenity, and certainly she is waiting for a positive result," said the Bolivian diplomat Robert Calladyl.
Many Bolivians will observe the ICJ decision on large screens across the country, hoping that he has stood in The Hague after decades of intense speech, supporting Bolivia's statement that Chili is obliged to negotiate the release of Bolivia's sovereign exit to the sea.
Eva Morales is the charismatic president of Bolivia, who faces a conflicting fight for re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he smothered at the end of August.
But some analysts think the court doesn't think it'll take a ruling for Bolivia and it's a little bit of a change, even if it does.
The AAN organization, based in the Netherlands, is not allowed to make a decision on Chile's territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of the possible negotiations.
That the ruling of the International Court of Justice comes out only six months after final arguments have been considered, testifying that the matter was not complex," said the Chilean expert at the branch of international law, Poz Zaraté.
And far without advancing the case of Bolivia, the last four years might have thrown it back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been manipulated by the current Bolivian administration," said Sarat.
She said that the apparent rhetoric of Maréléz had lost the remnants of Chilean benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but since that time the discussion will be very difficult.
Since 1962, two countries have not exchanged messages.
There was President Edward Radríguez Welce, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, who rejected the idea that the adoption of a court decision was uncommonly swift.
Monday would take Bolivia's "exclusive opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and "to put the end of 139 years of mutual speculation" he said.
It also denied that Morales is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, he has used the maritime issue as a political resistance.
"Bolivia never abandons her right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says that a nuclear disarmament thing won't come until they can trust the United States of America
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ria Young Ho says his country will never stop using its nuclear weapons until they can trust Washington.
I spoke to the General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to make promises made during the summit in Singapore between the leaders.
His comments are similar to those of the U.S.A. Mike Pampea, who looks like he's on the verge of restoring a nuclear deadlocked diplomat with North Korean Kim Chen Ein more than three months after Singapore.
Ree says it's a "no dream" to long sanctions and object to a US declaration of war in Korea ever put the North on its knees.
Washington is afraid to agree with the declaration, when Pyongyang doesn't take any significant steps at first.
And Kim, and President Donald Trump of the United States, are demanding the conduct of a second summit.
But there's a great skepticism about what Pyongyang is seriously taking to reject the arsenal, which the country is probably considering as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pampea plans to visit Pyongyang in the next months to prepare for the second Kim Trump summit.
On Paris fashion shows we saw the very new line in massive head cleanings on the way to shops in your cities
If you want to zoom in on your collection of hats or you can totally close the sun, you can no longer look for one.
Valentine's and Thom Brown designers presented on the rise a number of unusual head-pieces for their collection SS19, which exceeded the expectations of Paris Fashion Week.
This summer in Instagram were repopulated by the impeccable hats the designers who sent their creations on the floor.
Valentino's famous feature was a luxurious beige hat, ornamented with broad fields, similar to feathers, which filled the heads of models.
Other accessories of unusually large size included gifted coffee stones, a worm hat and even a pineapple, but they were not intended to keep their head warm.
Tom Brown also showed a set of jubilant masks--just towards Halloween.
Many of the colored masks were with sewn lips, and more resembled Hannibal Lecter than a high fashion.
One of them looked like a billiard for underwater swimming with a pipe and a gasket, and the other was like a floated frozen cone.
And when you continue to follow the immense attributes of fashion, you are fortunate.
Those who follow the style suggest that huge hats can crash into our everyday lives.
The hats of great size go on fives to “La Bomba”, a straw hat with fields of two feet wide, which can be seen in all, from Riana to Emily Ratajkovski.
An iconic label on a very uncomfortable hat, which had been disbanded in social networks, had contributed another great creation on the podium--a straw beach bag, almost as big as a model with this bag put on a buyer.
A dark-and-along bag of raffia, covered with a white leather handle, became an outstanding part of the Jacques La Riviera SS19 collection at the week's fashion collection in Paris.
The famous styler Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see a large hat and beach bags on the main streets next summer, as the designer proved to be a great influence, and it would be difficult to ignore an attempt at a negligent accessory."
John Edward: Speaking is a necessary skill for all the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland are keeping academically successful; it has been continuing since 2018 with another remarkable result of examinations, which are underpinned by individual and collective success in dispute, art, music and other beginnings of society.
Over 30,000 students across Scotland, schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to ensure a better level of work for their students and parents.
Independent schools try to prepare their students for the further higher education they have chosen their careers and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school programme, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable objects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a person in a language he understands, it stays in his head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart."
It's a vivid reminder that we can't only rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
So from the results of this year's final exam, we see that languages occupy the top places in the league table with the highest scorers in independent schools.
In the total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher score of A.
Data collected in 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved higher grade A in Chinese, while 72 percent had learned German, 69 percent had learned French, and 63 percent had obtained Spanish as well.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that are undoubtedly needed by children and young people in the future.
Now language as a subject is chosen just like STEMs (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
The survey conducted by the Commission on employment and the skills of the UK in 2014 showed that, among the reasons why employers have caused difficulties in filling vacancies, 17 percent were associated with a lack of language skills.
So more and more speaking skills become a necessity to prepare young people for the construction of their career.
Given the more promising workplaces that require language awareness, these skills become necessary in a globalized world.
Regardless of who you choose to pursue, learning another language in the future becomes a real asset when you have such skills for the rest of your life.
We also need to be able to communicate with people from other countries automatically put a lot of the people in the first place among competitors.
According to a survey of YouGov in which more than 4,000 British adults took part in the year 2013, 75 percent could not speak well enough in foreign language to speak, and French was the only language in which a two-digit percent spoke, 15 percent.
That's why learning is so important to children today.
There are a few languages, especially in developing countries, that will give children a more chance to find a good job.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the languages taught in it.
The class will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important to Britain by looking to the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter how interesting your child is, in independent schools there will always be a choice of a few languages with a tutor who is a specialist in this field.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and arm them with the skills needed to succeed regardless of what is to come.
At present, you can't deny that in the global business environment languages are still vital to the future of the country, so you have to put it into education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as "the skills of international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, variety and preference for the youth of Scotland.
It must be done
John Edward, director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is debuting in San Diego on Sundays.
A start of waiting for supporters who want to see LeBron James make his first start at Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton announced that James is playing a pre-season opening Sunday against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
But how many minutes it will play, you also have to determine.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," Walton said at the Lakers official website.
Canadian Lakers Mike Trudwell wrote that James probably would play in a limited minute.
According to the practice that came up this week, James had been asked about his plans on "six pre-season graphs".
"I don't need the pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Trampa performance time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
In the evenings in Wiling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump is starting a number of shares in the company.
It was the first of five scheduled Trump's talks next week, including stops in friendly places, Tennessee and Mississippi.
With regard to the election's arrival to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court, Trump is trying to strengthen the support for intermediate elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when voices are passed in November.
When does Trump's performance begin to-night in West Virginia, and how do you view it on the internet?
The Trumpe's performance in Winning, West Virginia, scheduled for 7 o'clock in the evening.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia performance on the internet below on YouTube.
Tramp, most likely, will this week consider hearings on candidature at the Supreme Court of Bretta Cavanaugh, which has problems with the prosecutions' sexual harassment with pending confirmation at the Senate of a vote for a week during the FBI's investigation.
But the main purpose of these speeches is to provide assistance to the Republicans, who are standing before the elections in November.
So the Trump president's company announced that these five spokes for the next few weeks to "activate the activity of volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority that they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives," said Reuters.
"Congress control is so important to his order of the day that the president will go to the maximum possible number of states, as we join the strained campaign season," said Reuters, a representative of the company Tramp.
Planned for the arena of Wesbanco Arena in Wilingu, today's action may attract supporters from Agao and Pennsylvania and draw attention to the Pitsburg media," reported The West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump visited West Virginia, the state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
The Trump is trying to help a Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morris, who is a leader in interrogation.
"It's not a very good sign for Morris that the president has to come to give him a push in the questioning," said Simon Hedar, a politician at the University of West Virginia, informs Reuters.
Kubak Rydera 2018: The US team is moving forward to fight to keep hope for life on a Sunday
After three lop-sided sessions on Saturday, perhaps it was exactly what it was necessary for this Ridder Cube.
A ping-ping ping-ping ping-ping is a completely set up controversial concept, in which players sincerely believe, and nothing more than a similar competition.
So where would they say the ping now?
"They had the advantage with six points, and now they have the four, so I think we're going through it with a little impulse," said Jordan Sleeping, walking for the day.
The advantage of Europe is, of course, four points forward and in the game, twelve more.
Americans, as the Pietch says, feel they have lightly blown the wind, and they have something to hope for, not least, because of the form of Sprite and Justin Thomas, who have been playing along all day, and everyone can boast of three points of four.
The Spot was deadly from T-shirts to greens and is an example.
These gutted shrieks of celebration were getting louder and louder as they lasted his round, and he sank the decisive blow to play the match on the four fields when they and Thomas stepped down two by two.
His punch, which allowed them to win the 15th match, was met with a similar cry, like what tells you he thinks the American team is not off.
"You just need to dig in and worry about your own match," said Spicy.
Already every one of these players is gone.
18 holes to make a score.
Over the last two days, the only players who have bought more points than Sweet and Thomas have been France's Painters and Tommy Fleetwood, the unhindered history of Ryder's Cup.
Strange but adorable couples in Europe can do nothing wrong.
The Malywoods were the only couple who didn't make the gods this Saturday afternoon, but they also ran off the gods on Saturday morning, Friday and this afternoon on Friday.
This happens, and like their energy, it kind of flows up to and out of this stormy crowd, and it claims that they are players who win on a Sunday, and that there wouldn't be more popular player to shut down a potential victory in Europe when the sun sets on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Malinari.
Requested both at the same time in different holes.
The conversation about European glory remains untimely.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson did a short work on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fur coat when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The gods and the two noblemen on the fore nine had dug out the Spanish and stitched it up, with which they had never been able to get out.
Sunday, however, no one will be able to help you with your hole.
The four ball and four games are so interesting to watch carefully because of the interaction between the composition of the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they do not implement, and the way strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has become a better team and has taken a significant role in the last day, but at this fourth meeting it also shows that the US team is striving to fight, in which some have been doubted, particularly in the US.
Europe goes out to the finals of Raider's Cube with a number 10-6
Europe will have a good advantage of the last day of Raider's Cup after it has come out of the Saturday matches of the four swords and four four with the advantage of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired Duet of Tommy Fleetwood and France's Malinaras marked the fight with two victories over Tiger Woods, to sum up the results in Le Golf Nationals to four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, trying to keep a trophies which they lost in Hazelin two years ago, served in an American agency of discontent in the morning, receiving a series of 3-1.
The US offered more competition in the match of the four games by winning the two games, but they couldn't do more.
To keep a trophy, Jim Furrick's side needs eight points of the 12 solitary match-ups a week.
Fleetwood is the first European first to win four points in a row, and he and the Mallinari, who got the name Molliwood after a sensational weekend, are the second couple to win four points for their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
By beating Woods and Patrick the Red in four balls, they were wonderfully braced to defeat the late Woods and the American concubine Brian Dekamba yet 5 and 4.
Woods, who spent himself in two games on Saturday, showed a random splash of shine, but now he played 19 out of the 29 times in the match-playing four and four and seven in a row.
Justin Rawls, resting on his four ball games, went back to his partner, Henrik Stanston, in his four-ball game, to his 2 & 1 stint Johnssan and Brooks Kopeki, taking one and the other seat in the world.
Europe had not had its way, though it had been pleasant, fresh day south of the west of Paris.
On Saturday, the three-time winner, Jordan White and Justin Thomas, set the checkpoint for Americans by two points.
They won 2 and 1 over John Ram and Ian Pulther with Spain in four games and came back later to win the Puler and Rory Macilroy 4 and 3 in the fours, losing two holes.
Only twice in the history of Cupid Ryder the command came back from a definition of four points which goes alone, though only the Furick owners need to draw to keep the trophy.
However, after the next two days, which were the best, the counterattack on Sunday looked as if they were going to make it all work.
North Korea says that no way will be allowed to drop out of lop-sided order without trust
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea has said that on Saturday the United Nations organization continues to sanction the mistrust of the US, and under such conditions the country cannot refuse a nuclear weapon in an arbitrary manner.
Yoon-ho reported to the annual General Assembly of the World Authority that last year North Korea had adopted “significant measures of goodwill”, for example, halting trials on nuclear and missile sites, dismantling a nuclear test zone and promising non-proliferation and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see the right answer from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no first way in which to disarm ourselves in an arbitrary manner."
Despite the fact that Ri had republished the usual North Korean complaints of countering Washington's "staged" approach to dinuklerization, under which North Korea had been rewarded, as it had taken progressive steps, his application turned out to be significant in that it did not reject the arbitrary announcement of denuclearization that had been made to the Pynans in the past.
Ri was saved by a mixed statement by Kim Chen Ein and Donald Trump at the first in history by the US President himself and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim asked to work on the road to "the Korean peninsula". At that Trump promised to give security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea is trying officially to end the war in Korea from 1950 to 53 years, but the United States has said that Pyongyang should first refuse a nuclear weapon.
Washington also supported the call to cancel the hard international sanctions in relation to North Korea.
"The United States of America is first insisting on "sealisation" and on increasing pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal in a forced manner, and even against "war war end," Ri says.
"Aware of the fact that sanctions can put us on our knees, is the indescribable dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the sequel to sanctions deepens our mistrust."
Ri had not mentioned plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US chief had celebrated earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and the leader of South Korea, Moon Jae-in, in the last five months, and added, "If the participants in this issue of denuclearization were South Korea, not the US, the de-invoicing of the Korean peninsula would not be such a fool."
However, Ri's tone was very different from last year when he spoke to AAN at the General Assembly claiming that the targeting of the U.S. contingent with the use of North Korea missiles was inevitable after Mr. President of the Evil, Trump called Kim "the rocketman" himself.
This year at AN Trump, who last year threatened to “bring to ruin” by North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking measures for disarmament, but said that there would be a great deal more to be done, and sanctions must remain in force until the same couple came forward.
Trump reported on Wednesday that he doesn't have a time frame for it, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
The Council of Security has stated that it is up to the Phoenician to be rewarded for its measures.
However, the secretary of the U.S.A. Mike Pampeaux told the Council on Thursday that "The performance of the Security Council's sanctions must continue actively and absolutely until we are sure of full, final and confirmed denuclearization."
The Security Council lifted its sanctions in respect of North Korea in 2006 to try to halt the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic-missile programmes.
Pampea met with Ri in the inks of Soviet Security, and the General Assembly then said that he would visit Pyongyang again in the coming months to prepare for the next summit.
Pampea visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In July he left Pyongyang, stating that his progress had been achieved with North Korea for a few hours of speech, and ended the application visa, which he submitted to the demands of "similar to gangsters".
At a meeting with Munam in this month, North Korea asked to eliminate the missile installation and the nuclear complex when the United States would take "appropriate measures".
Trump said that Kim's "appropriate measures" he was waiting for was a guarantee of security and an effort to normalise relations with Washington, which Trump promised in Singapore.
Harvard students take the course on their proper rest.
The new Harvard University course this year has to teach students more sleep, and it's my goal to struggle with a culture of learning at night with coffee in hand.
The scientist came to the conclusion that students at one of the best universities in the world often do not know how to take care of themselves properly and for their health.
Charles Chacesler, a medical professor of sleep at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist in a hospital named Brigham and a female hospital, developed a course which, in his opinion, is the first of his kind in the U.S.
Inspired by the speech about the impact of the lack of sleep on learning, he began the course.
And at the end of the lecture, one girl came up to me and said, "Why did you tell me that just now, at the last lesson?"
'She said no one and never told her about the importance of sleep--it surprised me,' he said the Telegraph.
This year's first year's course, presented by a student, will explain why good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting achievement, as well as to improved overall moods.
Paul Barreyre, a Ph.D. professor at Harvard Medical School and an executive director of health care at the university, said that the university had decided to take a course after finding out that students had often been deprived of sleep for a week.
An hour-long course has a series of interactive tasks.
There's one section of the room on the Internet where students press coffee cups, curtains and books that tell you about the effects of coffee and light and how a lack of sleep affects sporting displays and how important a habit is before bedtime.
At an on-the-spot stage, participants tell us how multi-year sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of a compass, with interactive images, tells people to think about their everyday lives.
"We know that this moment will not change the behavior of students.
But we think they have to know it just as well as everybody knows the consequences of smoking for health," added Professor Chacesler.
He said that the culture of late evenings still exists, adding that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students leads to sleep avoidance, which is becoming a bigger problem.
"The guaranteed sleep of a good quality must be a "secret weapon" of students for the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety," he said, "even to avoid excess weight, because sleep avoidance makes the brain constantly hungry."
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californian student who studies chemical and physical biology, assisted Professor Chaisler in developing the course.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to teach everyone on the campus.
He's hoping that the next step will be asking all the graders to complete a similar learning program before going to university.
Professor Chasesler recommended that students be able to set up watches to know, when they go to sleep and when they wake up, knowing the harmful consequences of "blue light" being beamed from displays and light lights that can change the basic mode that leads to problems with drowsiness.
Livingston 1:0 Rangers: Menga is killing Gerard's goal.
Rangers suffered another stroke when the goal of Dolly Mangi was confident that Stephen Gerard would not get a 1-0 stroke at Liingstan Stadium.
Ibrax wants to save his first victory on the way to a triumph with 4-1 in February in St. John's, but Gary Holtana's team already has their second defeat as a manager of 18 games to leave their side eight points, falling back from the leadership of the Ladbrokes Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers team, inspired by the naked, did not look like he was suffering a stroke.
While Rangers is down in sixth place, Livingstone is up third place, behind Hibernians, with a gap in balls.
More problems may appear to the Rangers after the Fort Calum Spence has recovered from his head after he's had a subject thrown out of the rostrum.
Gerard had made eight changes to the players, so Ira had not played for the half-finals of Bethfrid's Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi under 11 which allowed to pick up the entry from Hearts last week, and was delighted to see how well they had at every step bypassed their opponents.
Rangers was more in control of the ball, but Livingstone made more attempts to kill the ball.
They had to kill in two minutes when for the first time the Mengis directed the ball through Scott Pitman to the gates of Alan McGregar, and then the half-barioner used that chance.
Caygan's successful punitive blow occurred to Craig Halket's nap, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgo, was able to take a strong blow from behind.
Rangers has gained control, but in the last third of the game, they have more hope of killing than showing a good game.
Alfred Marrelas certainly had to be punished by a quarter of an hour before the end, when he and Stephen Loveles faced in the field, but Judge Stephen Thompson did not take the complaint of Colombia.
Rangers managed to hit the gate only in the first half of the game, but there was a diamond named Ibrox Liam Kelly almost handed over the goal of Lasan Kulibali and an effective attack on Ovi Ejaria.
While killing the first goal at 34 minutes, Libya may have been against the further active game, but no one is denying that they have to demonstrate to the contrary a good game.
And again, Rangers couldn't break the Jacobs gate.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher gave Scott Robinson a pass, who was blocking Mengo to get a chance to kill at the gate.
Gerard replaced Kulibali's break with Ryan Kent, and it turned out to be an effective action when an attack broke into Marylas's, but the startling Kelly ran and prevented the blow.

Almanac: Founder of Geiger's counter proposal.
This is a "Sunday Morning" page from our Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE PALICIAN... the day of future physicist Iagan Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of imaging and measuring the radioactivity which eventually led to the device being played, known as the Geiger counter.
Geiger's counter became a part of science and appeared in pop culture, as in the 1950s' film "The Koranad," in which those seemed to be little-known scholars Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: Who is he on earth?'
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter that's used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
If you're applying earphones, you really can hear the sounds of atoms that are passionate about mineral life."
Evans: "Say it really needs it now?"!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before he was 63 years old.
But inventions that bear his name continue to be used.
A new progressive vaccine can help the immune system "see" the cancer cells.
A new anti-Hungarian vaccine can help to "see" the bad cells and destroy them.
It's like teaching an immune system to recognize the bad cells, which will appear in treatment.
The method is to get immune cells from the patient and change them in the laboratory.
Then cells can "see" squirrels, spread out in many cancer cells, and then re-enter helper cells.
A test window demonstrates successful results for patients with different types of cancer.
One woman, who had been introduced a vaccine that helped the immune system detect cancer cells, found that ovarian cancer has disappeared for 18 months.
The method includes getting immune cells into the patient, changing them into a lab so they can see HER2 proteins common to many cancer cells, and then being reintroduced.
Professor Jay Berzoffsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute at Bethes State of Maryland said that our results show that there is a very promising vaccine.
"HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of antineoplastic cells that fight the cancer of the small glands, ovaries, lungs, and thick bones," said Professor Berazofsky.
Similar approaches to finding immune cells in patients and learning them can achieve cancer cells well worked in the treatment of leukosis.
Kanye West stepped up to the discussion in support of the Trump, carrying the title IAEA, after he appeared in the SNL.
That didn't turn out well.
In a studio during Saturday night's Cane West was filmed after a speech he praised in the United States. President Donald Trump said he would be on the run for the second term in 2020.
Following an evening's execution of his third song, entitled "The City of Pride", when he was in the hat "Make America Again Great", he spoke against the Democrats and confirmed his support for the Trump.
'How many times do I talk to white people, and they say, 'How can you support the Trump, he's growing up?'
"Well, if I were worried about racism, I'd have left America for a long time," he said.
SNL began playing with the main role of Matt Damon, where a Hollywood star surprised Brett Cavanaugh's performance in front of the Senate court committee in considering the sexual violence of Christine Blacey Ford.
Despite the fact that the talk wasn't broadcast, the Webmaster's words were framed and loaded into social media by Chris Rock.
It wasn't clear whether Rock tried to give up the West.
Besides, West complained to the public that he had a tough time behind the scenes.
They were bumping at me behind the scenes.
They were like, "Don't come out there with that cap.
They're joking over me.
"And then they say I'm in a rotten place," he said, as the newspaper the Washington Examiner reported.
The news went on: Do you want to see the drift place? 'Touching what it is' putting on my scrmen hat, what did it mean he couldn't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go on?'
Try to love.
Because of his statements, the hearings were withdrawn at least twice, and the SNA representatives were puzzled by a message from Vereita. "The whole studio fell silent."
The West was taken as a substitute for Ariana Grande's singers, whose ex-boyfriend, the rapper McMiller, died a few days ago.
The West surprised many by the performance of the song I Love It, dressed in a bottle of water, Perrier.
The West received support from the head of the conservative TPUSA party, Kendes Turner, who wrote on Twitter, "One of the bravest spirits Thank you for your support."
But the driving sound of Karen Hunter wrote that West is just who he is, and it's always delicious.
"But I decided NOT to reward anyone by buying his music or his clothes, or by supporting his "art," which I consider, embraces and unmistaks the ideology that is damaging to my community.
He's free.
So are we," she added.
Announcing his name was changed in Twitter before the show, he said that he was now "officially named Kane West".
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he's gone after Grandpa's tracks, also known as Puff Didddi.
His colleague's rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion Ness and, of course, the legend of music, which changed his name to a symbol; then he and the artist, formerly known as the Prince.
Attempting to kill at Belfast Restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a restaurant on the east side of Belfast with a second man assaulted on Friday.
The incident occurred in Balikhamor, as reported by the police.
The accused will appear in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecution will be considered by the State prosecutor.
The star of Kit Harrington's "The Guns of the Thrones" has caught on to idealized brutality.
Kit Harrington is known for his swinging sword and for the role of John Snow in a series of "The Bulls of Throats" in a combat of the medieval grayness of HBO
But a 31-year-old actor got the stereotype of the hero macho, which means young boys often feel more tough to respect.
Speaking in the Culture section of the Sunday Times, Keith said he thought something had happened and asked how to solve the problem of idealized brutality in the #MeToo era.
The whale, who recently married her neighbor Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that she feels the strength of solving this problem.
"Do I feel personally strong--if we were wrong with courage?" he said.
"Why should we teach men when they grow up, from the point of view of the attitude that we see now?"
The whale thinks that television has to be responsible for the phenomenon of brutality because of very male persons.
He went on, "What lies in the beginning, and why is it taught?
Why teach on TV and in the streets, making young boys feel that they need to be so sure to be a real person?
I think it's really one of the biggest questions of our time -- how are we going to change that?
Because it's obvious that something happens to young people.
In an interview, he also admitted that the series would end in the following summer, and he would come out of the battle of a series and would not make doqvells or shekels to the "Growled Thrones."
From November Kitt will begin to revive the real West Sam Shephard, who is a historical director with his brother, who is a slave.
A recent history actor who considered meeting with Rose's wife the best opportunity to finish "The Stones Ball."
"I've met my wife in this series, so I've got my future family and my life here," he said.
The rose played the Igritt (Ygritte), a person whose beloved character, Keith John Snow, is in this fantastic series rewarded by Amy.
The couple wrapped up in June 2018 at Leslie's home in Scotland.
HlV / AIDS: China reports an increase of 14%
China has announced that the number of citizens living with HlV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
According to health information, more than 820,000 people have contracted the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, as it were in the past.
Traditionally, HlV infection is spreading in some parts of China as a result of a blood transfusion.
"But the number of people infected with HlV infection by blood transfusions has fallen almost zero," said the Chinese officials at a conference in the province of June.
Yet, each year, the number of people living with HlV and AIDS in China grows by 100,000.
Sexual HlV infection is the acute problem of China's LGBT.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT-people before eating.
Because of the conservative value in the country about 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many diseases are spread from lack of knowledge and sexual concepts.
Since 2003, the government of China has asked universal access to HlV medicines in its efforts to address this global problem.
Max's Waters refuses to merge the data, the danger and the theory of conspiring it to the employees of parliament
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters dropped the charges Saturday in that her co-worker posted personal information on three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia's pages.
Democratic Los Angeles has claimed that the show is open to wingers and their websites.
"Fool, lie, and a lot of disgusting lies," said Waters in a Twitter statement.
The published information provides home addresses and phone numbers in the U.S. sense. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information posted by an unknown person on a capital hill during a Senate press hearing on charges of sexual harassment against a member of the Supreme Court of Bret Cavanaugh appeared on the internet on Thursday.
It was a diversion some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
"Conserative sites, such as Gateway Puundit and RedState, reported that the IP source was linked to the Waters office and distributed information to the Waters team employee," said Hill.
"It's an unreasonable claim totally false and absolutely false," continued Waters.
"Member of my team, whose data, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, never in any way responsible for the leaking of this information.
It's groundless confirmation completely false and absolutely false."
A Waters application quickly sparked a criticism of the internet, including the former sugar pressman the White House of Ari Fleischer.
"It is adamantly causing anger," wrote Fleischer.
That means she doesn't have the courage to be a member of Congress.
If anyone is accused of doing anything they must not be angry.
They don't have to behave shamefully.
They should not be put under suspicion the motives of their accusation.
They must be calm and good-natured.
Fleischer compared the Waters' reaction to the critic of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, if they were accused of being too angry at hearing on Thursday.
Amar Navar, a candidate for the Republican Party, who is battered and participates in meetings at the mid-term elections, also came out in Twitter.
"It's a resonance, if you find it true," he wrote.
In her statement Waters stated that her office had warned the relevant authorities and legal authorities about these false claims.
"We guarantee that the guilty will be found," she continued, "and they will take legal responsibility for all their actions which are destructive and dangerous to any of the employees of my team".
Overview of Johnny English Strikes Against a blow on Rowen Atkinson's invented spy.
Now it's become a tradition to look for the meaning of BROXITI in any new British-style movie, and this hill seems to be in comedy and ex-French Johnny Ingleisha, which started in 2003 with Johnny Ingleisha, and came in 2011 with the name "Joney Ingleisha's Advision".
Can a brother-in-law speak well of how clearly absurd we look when we're talking about new possibilities of exportation?
Anyway, secondly, when he appeared in print, incompetent Johnny English got the opportunity to laugh at things--his name was more loud than all the comical creations that he had made for non-English audiences in the cinema.
Of course, he's a secret agent, who, in spite of his bizarre claim to glamour, got a little bit like Clouseau with Mr. Bean's face and a little bit of a lad who brought one note to the Horus by the fire at the ceremony of opening the Olympics in London in 2012.
Initially his personage was based on the traveller and international secrets of Atkinson, who once played in the forgotten Barkeleycard, leaving chaos in his way.
So here's a couple of nice moments that I've never had before.
I liked Johnny Ingleish, who is approaching the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, and spade the rotor a little knock on his helmet.
Dr. Atkinson for the theatrical comedy is brilliantly demonstrated, but humor is feeling weak, and so strangely especially when serious movies, such as "Agent 007: mission unreal", are sure to offer comedy as the main part.
Humour feels as if it are not only for adults but also for children, and even ridiculous accidents of Johnnie Ingleisha are not as resourceful as Atkinson's silent films in Bean's face.
Multi-year-old topical think tanks are the serious problems of Great Britain.
A cyber hacker broke into a super-secret British spy community in the U.K., revealing the names of all the British agents on the scene, to the disillusionment of a security agent -- unfortunately, Kevin Eldon's little role.
It's the last drop for the Prime Minister, who is a proud and mixed-up kid, who is already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything he can with this quagmi-Tessai-My, but the script has nothing to do with it.
Her intelligence consultants report that since every real spy will be exposed, she'll have to step up some of the people who are already retired.
And that means that for Johnnie Ingleish himself everything is complicated: now he works as a sixth teacher in a few high schools and gives lessons as being an undiscovered operator: some good examples here, because English offers the Academy of Music spy lessons.
English returned to Whitehall for an extra briffinding and contacted his former longtime friend, Bo, who was playing Ben Miller again.
At present, Bo's marriage, bound to the commander of a submarine, whose role was Vicky Pepperdin performing a little vainly.
So Batman and Robin get the terribly wrong things at the secret agency of the Queen, where they work again, meeting up with the beautiful woman Volga Keelenka.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is getting a dangerous command from a charismatic billionaire technical billionaire who claims to be able to solve the problems with United Kingdom hackers: Jason Volt, who's ominous, who's playing Jake Lacey.
Inglesh and Bo are beginning their action with immediate things: disguise yourself under official duty, burn down the French restaurant; create a pogrom, fight against the contrabandists on board the luxurious Volta yacht; Inglesh makes a clean anarchy, for it tries to use the suit of virtual reality to get acquainted with the interior of the house of Volta.
All the moments taken out for the last event, but also agreeable and boisterous, which has quite a lot of children in television.
Pretty good stuff.
And how about other movies about Johnny Ingleisha that I couldn't think of: can't the British film industry give Rowan an Atkinson a role that really demonstrates his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to draft a plan to pay the British four-day working week payments made in five days.
Jeremy Corbin's work party is scheduled to consider a radical plan when the British work only four days a week, but they're paid for five.
The party reportedly wants companies to hand over the work results made as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence, giving them an extra weekend.
It would seem that the employees were going to enjoy the weekends, but would still get the same wage.
The source notes that the idea matches the economic program of the party, and plans to direct the country to support the workers.
The union congresses approved the transition to a four-hour week as a good way to make use of change in the economy.
An older source in the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: "The review of actions will be announced by the end of the year.
It's not going to happen right now, but four-day work a week is an idea that follows a look at a party and a general industrial strategy for regulating the economy to the benefit of workers.
The Labour Party is not the first to approve such an idea, Green promised to hold a four-day week job during the general voting campaign in 2017.
The Labour Party's momentum, however, is generally not supported.
The producer of the Labour Party said, "Four days a week's work is not party politics, it's not party politics, it's not party-oriented."
Chancellor John McDonnell used a working conference last week to make a vision of the social revolution in economics.
Mr. McDonnell said that he had decided to regain power from "blessed directors" and "monagers" in a communist venture.
The cost-effective chancellor's plans also mean that the current water shareholder can't get back all the shares, because the government of Labour could do a "calculation" on the grounds of alleged abuses.
He also confirmed that he was planning to bring work into the company councils and create joint ownership funds to transfer 10 percent of his own resources to private employees who would maintain an interest dividend of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Candy, said for "60 minutes," that the FBI, working with the Kavano, had to change their mind.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh has been suspended at the end of his election to the Supreme Court at least a week, and the question is whether they can output the Republican Senators' Bureau to support it.
On an interview Sunday, Scott Pélie asked the Republicans of Johnny Candy and Lyndsey Graham about "Sens" -- or the FBI can unveil anything that could lead to change.
Candy turned more open than his trouser with the South Queen.
"I mean, of course," said Kandi.
'I said, going to court: I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened and asked him about the prosecution's reason, asking him, "Did you do it?
He was resolute and unequivocal."
Graham's statement, however, seemed to be final.
"I think that Brett Cavanaugh decided it would be a scandalous accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but I know this: Brett decidedly refuses it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blaise Ford.
'And all she calls could not believe it.
She's only 36 years old.
I can't see anything new."
What is the International Civil Festival, and what is it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York, the International Festival is happening: an annual music event that has a very startling composition of speakers and performers and my mission to stop poverty in the world.
Now, for the seventh year, the world festival of society will take place on the big town of Central Park, where tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy the concert by Janet Jackson, Cardie B, and Sean Mendes, and learn about the real purpose of the event, the halting of poverty and hunger until 2030.
The international festival of society, which emerged in 2012, is the length of the Global Project against the heads of the international propaganda group, which is hoping to stop poverty by increasing the number of people fighting actively against it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if you don't want to pay the VIP ticket) the visitor had to carry out a number of tasks or "do the stock", be a volunteer, write an email to the country's leader, call any other actors and raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was the civil festival for 12 years and could it achieve its purpose?
Is it an idea to reward people with a free concert in a real way to convince people to take action, or is it just another case of so-called "cryctvism" -- people feel that they are doing a good job by signing an online petition or by sending a tweet?
Since 2011, festival organizers have said that they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from their supporters, who are trying to achieve different goals.
They say that these actions have helped to push influence leaders to commit more than 37 billion dollars in liabilities that can affect lives than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018 the group brought 390 comments on commitments and applied for at least 10 billion dollars, which had already been disbursed or collected.
According to the group's estimate, the funds provided so far were directly influenced by nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key responsibilities include providing food, partnerships with investors and performers based in the UK, “helping children develop in full volume”, a pledge to ensure Rwanda with $35 million to help avoid malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Tweets from citizens.
"In support of the government of Great Britain, donors, national governments and citizens of different countries, we are able to combat social injustices of malnutrition in history," said Ambassador Tracy Ulman in London in April 2018.
In addition, the group reported that, after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve food for mammoths and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced funding for the food aid project, which reached 5 million women and children with food problems.
In answer to one of the many questions on the website "which makes you think that we can end poverty?"
The global festival responded: It will be a long and hard way, sometimes we'll have a parasite and a failure.
But like the big civil rights and the anti-apartheid movement, we're going to succeed, because together we're stronger.
Janet Jackson, Wickand, Sean Mendez, Cardie B, Janet Monae is one of the series of speakers for this year's New York event that will be held by Debra-Lee Fernès and Hugh Jackman.
U.S.A. can use the Navy for "blocks" to prevent Russian oil and gas export
"Washington may, if necessary, turn to the Navy's Military Navy to prevent the withdrawal of Russian energy from the EZ and Middle East markets," said U.S.S. secretary Ryan Zinc, Washington Examiner.
The walls of the claims that the actions of Russia in Syria, in particular where it works upon the invitation of the rule of law, are an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe their reason for being in the Middle East is that they want to buy energy the same as they do in Eastern Europe and south Europe," he said.
And, as a matter of fact, there are ways and means to cope with this.
"The United States is able, with the assistance of the Navy, to ensure the openness of maritime routes, and when needed, to set up a blockade so that their energy probably doesn't get to the market," he said.
Zinek has been addressing stakeholders for the energy users Alliance, a non-profit group that positions itself as a "consumer's voice" in the US.
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they were essentially the same.
"An economic alternative to Iran and Russia more or less equals and replaces fuel," he said, calling Russia a "single country" with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These statements came at a time when the Trump administration wanted to significantly increase its sample natural gas exports to Europe by replacing Russia, which was a much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this purpose, Trampo's executives, including President Donald Trump, were trying to convince Germany to step out of the "unlawful" project of the North Stream 2 gas project, which, according to the Trampo, turned Berlin into a captive Moscow.
The mass has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline, worth 11 billion dollars, which is set up to raise the power of an existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is an exclusive economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's severe opposition to this project takes place in economics, and is an example of unscrupulous competition.
"I believe that we have the only view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to select suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak after meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Peri in September in Moscow.
Americans got a hit back from Germany, which once again confirmed its propriety.
A major German industry organization, the Federation of German Producers (BDI), has called on the US to stay out of EU energy policy and two-way negotiations between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third state getting involved in our supply of energy," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Producers (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the President of Russia Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is going to have a very serious discussion about her participation in the 2020 presidential election, according to Senator Massachusetts
A senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would seriously consider her participation in the presidential election after the intermediate elections.
During a speech in the interest of Khalioki, Massachusetts, Warren, she argued that she was considering her opportunity.
"It's time for women to head towards Washington and disqualify our failed government, and I'm also talking about women on the highest seats," she said, agreeing with the Hill.
"After 6th of November I will take a very serious look at the possibility of running into the presidents."
During the event in the mayor's speech, Warren stood up at President Donald Trump, saying that he "will lead the country in the wrong direction".
"I am extremely concerned about what Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren openly critical of the Trump and his candidate at the Supreme Court of Breth Cavanaugh.
On Friday in your TV, Warren wrote "a well-known need for the FBI to investigate" before voting.
However, the survey published on Thursday showed that most Warren voters do not think she should be running for presidents in 2020.
According to an inquiry by the Center for Political Studies of the University of Safalka/Bostán Glob, fifty percent of the "mighty" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be on the run.
Thirty-two percent support her decision.
The survey showed more support for former Governor Devil Patrick, where 38 percent was for it, and 48 percent against it.
Other known names include the former Vice President Joe Byden and the Senator for the State of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Associated Press Baden said he's going to take an official decision on this cold.
On a trip to Donald Trump, Sarah Palin mentioned the post-traumatic syndrome of Treka Palin
26-year-old Trick Palin spent a year in Iraq after being called to serve in September.
On Monday evening he was arrested and he was presented with charges in domestic violence
"What passes my son through after his return, I can compare with the results of the post-crime syndrome and wounding with which our soldiers, in the other families, are returning," she said gathered at the departure in support of Donald Trump in Tals, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest a "distant question" and said that her son, along with the other veterans of the war, was "turning back a little bit, tempered, coming back with the question of whether there was any respect for which soldiers, pilots, other military prisoners, gave themselves over to the country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wassal, Alaska, and he received charges of domestic violence against the woman, preventing attempts to report domestic violence, our weapons in a drunken state, according to Dan Bennett's data, the police department's press secretary, Vassila.
18 states and the district of Colombia support failures to provide a facility with new policies
Eighteen states and the district of Colombia support the denial of a new U.S. policy that refuses to shelter a victim of gang violence or domestic violence.
The 18 state and district teachers in Columbia gave up an analytical note Friday in Washington, D.C. to support the opposition of politics to the provision of a shelter, reported by NBC News.
The plaintiff's full name in the case of Grace against the Seshns, which was opened in August by the American Union on civil rights against federal politics, was not revealed.
She stated that her partner "and his friends with the stiff band" had raped her, but the U.S. authorities 20 July turned down the port.
She was detained in Texas.
Tourists in states supported by Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which the largest number of requests for shelter in the United States are countries that have serious gang issues and domestic violence.
A new American immigration policy changed the 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Commission, which allowed immigrants without documents that were victims of domestic violence, to turn to the shelter.
Kalombia District Attorney-General Carl Raysin stated on Friday that a new policy "ignors decades of challenging state, country and world experience".
"Federal employment requires that applications for shelter be based on specific facts and circumstances of the case, and that change violates this principle," says the analytical note.
The lawyers also stated in a note that politicians who deny immigrants are worsening the U.S. economy, saying that immigrants can often become entrepreneurs and "create the necessary jobs".
Prosecutor General Jeff Seshns ordered judges in June on immigration matters no longer to give shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"The use is given to whoever leaves their country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationalism or belonging to a social group or political opinion," said Season 11 of June, announcing this policy.
The plant has never meant solving problems, not even all the serious problems people around the world face every day.
Desperately saving floor work. When you try to find those who survived, you double the number of dead.
Those who survive are in a very difficult situation.
"It's all very tense," said the 35-year-old mother of RIS Kusum, calming her little son from the temperature at the evacuation center of the destroyed town of Palu.
"Every minute a car is fast enough to bring in whole.
Clean water is very little."
The lodgers began to come back to their broken ladies, picking up the wet things, trying to save everything you could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-ball earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including the two Harris, who broke his spine and shoulder, are outside the army hospital in Palu, where patients are being treated outside because of the heavy jolts which repeat themselves.
In his eyes there were tears when he saw a feeling of strong underground jolts in the living room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to return.
I was clenched under the ruins of the wall," said Harris Associated Press, and added that his family had come to town for a marriage.
'I heard the wife call to help, but then be quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they are safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of threats using "propagandising"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American daily, praising the mutual benefits of American and Chinese trade, an American ambassador to China for Beijing's indictments in the use of American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday a platinum addition of China Daily to Des Moines Register, the state of Ayav's most selling business -- after he accused China of trying to make amends in the elections in the U.S. Congress on November 6th, which is China's indictment.
The accusation that China tried to intervene in American elections was that American officials called it in a conversation with Reuters that was a new phase in the Washington campaign of pressure on China.
While advertising is located by foreign governments is a normal practice of trade promotion, now Beijing and Washington have unleashed a trade war that resulted in mutual tariffs on imports.
Repressive fares, said US and Chinese experts, were introduced to injure such a exhibitor as entrepreneurs from the state of Iowa, which support the Republican Party of Trump.
Terry Bransted, U.S. ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods in China, said that Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, wrote by Brunstad in an article on the Sunday issue of Des Moines Register, “now doubles its efforts by printing a propaganda advertisement in our free press. ”
"In disseminating its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the good American tradition of freedom of speech and of free press, printing the paid advertisement at Des Moines Register," wrote Bransted.
"And if you look at the newspaper whales in Beijing, there you will find not so many voices against and you will not see the real reflection of other assumptions which might have about a dangerous trajectory in the economy, because the press is under China's Iron Fifth Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers refused to make a suggestion" to print his article, although he did not even call it a newspaper.
Republicans push warlords' women the day before the intermediate elections from the fiese Kavano, warn analysts
While many famous Republicans defend a candidate for the rank of Supreme Judge Brett Cavanaugh in front of the face of several charges of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will get a blow in response, especially by women, during the forthcoming intermediate elections.
Emotions around this were very strong, and most Republicans have already shown that they are ready to vote.
"This stuff is no longer possible to return," said Grant Ryhar, professor of political science at Maxwell Syracuse University of the edition of The Hill, for an article published on Saturday.
Richard stated that it is not certain that Senator Jeff Flaik (Arezona)'s statements about the FBI's investigation will be enough to reassure the angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday – they won't forget it tomorrow and in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, a leading advocate and national press secretary of the progressive group MoveOn, coming from Washington, Columbia.
On Friday morning, protesting scandals "November quickly!" during a demonstration in the Senate living room, when Republicans who control the Law Committee decided to put forward Kavano's candidature, in spite of Dr. Christian Blacey Ford's statement, agreed with Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for democracy will be extremely large," said Stu Rotenberg, an independent political analyst, announced.
"People say they're already tall, and that's true.
But they can be even more tall, especially among women barbers in suburbs and young voters from 18 to 29 years, who want to and don't like president, but who often don't vote."
Even before the open statement, Ford, in which she detailed her claim to a candidate in the Supreme Court of Sexual Violence, analysts suggest that if Republicans insist on confirmation, they may have a strong kick back.
"For the Republican Party this has become some mess," said Michael Steele, former head of the National Bureau of the Republican Party at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"The talk doesn't go about vote by the Bureau or about final voting, or whether the Kavano is going to take office. The talk about how the Republicans handled it and how they got it," says Guy Cecil, director of the US priority group, who is helping to select Democrats.
However, it looks like the American people shared a little bit more about Ford or Cavanaugh law, because the last person they spoke about is a little bit more.
A new survey by youGov indicates that 41 percent of the respondents are probably or are not sure about the Ford statement, and 35 percent said that they are probably or are not sure about Kavano.
At the same time, 38 percent said that they thought the Kavano might or might have guessed what they said, and 30 percent said the same thing about the Ford.
After a jolt by Flayk's FBI investigates the charges against Ford and, at least, another person, Deborah Ramiz, reports the Guardian.
Over the past week, Ford made an application under an oath by the Senate Law Bureau, which Kavano, when he was drunk, was trying to reach her when she was 17 years old.
Ramiz claims that a candidate in the Supreme Court demonstrated her genitalia at a dinner when they were studying in Yale in the 1980s.
A World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new internet to create Google and Facebook competition
And this is Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world's network, who runs a startup that's going to be a competition for Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The last project of technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built on the open Berners-Li Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where the data is stored, and who is allowed to access this information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Burners-Lee said that by creating Inrupt he meant "management of the world".
"I have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"This is a hospitable moment."
It uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own repository of data from the Internet or from within.
This can contain contact lists, aliases, calendars, phoonetics and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available at once on a single browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal repository given on the Internet is that user determines only who has access to some type of information.
The company calls it "the personal patent with data."
According to the executive director of John Bruce's company, the idea of creating Inrupt gives the company the opportunity to make a combined resource, process and skill in order to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The campaign now consists of Burners-Li, Bruce, IBM-buying security platforms for several developers working on this project under contract, and hand-pickers.
As of that week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised programs using the Inrupt website.
Brners-Lee said that he and his team didn't talk to Facebook and Google about whether they were introducing or not complete changes if all their business models were to be immediately reviewed.
"We do not ask their permission."
In a Saturday publication on Medium Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt mission "is to secure commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the whole and the new network created by Solid."
Berners-Li transformed the internet in 1994 by creating a World Wide Web Consortium in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been very influential in recent months in favour of net neutrality.
Even by launching Inrupt, Burners-Li will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Network Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the new era of the web," Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Van: Honoring the clergyman rewarded by the Victory Cross at World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England, rewarded with the Cross of Victoria during the First World War as a party to the battles, was celebrated in his town in 100 years.
Bernard Van's reverend arsonist was rewarded on September 29, 1918 for being attacked by Bellenglise and Leakour.
Four days later, however, he died from a sniper's bullet and never found out that he had received the highest military military prize.
On Saturday at Rashden, the county of Nartgemptanshire two his grandchildren in a parade opened a monumental stone.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "very symbolic," that the stone opened 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, fireman Van found his battalion through the de San Quentin Canal "through a thick needle and under a strong pink and bulletproof fire of a slaver."
Then he ran on the line of fire and "with great boldness" led the soldiers forward, grasping the cannon himself, and beating out three divisions.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, and a little more than a month later the war was over.
72-year-old Michael Van said that his grandfather's actions were "something that I could never do, and also something worthy of respect."
He and his brother Dr. James Van also took a wreath after a parade which marked the Imperial youth orchestra of Brentwood.
Michael Van said that "for his great honour to take part in the parade," and added that "the courage of the real hero has been demonstrated by the support that many have."
Fans of MMA waited all night to see Bellator 206, they had instead got the lead Pepa
Just imagine you've been spending the entire night watching the secure transmission from Bellator 206 and then refusing to watch the main event.
The program with San Jose had 13 fights, including six on top of the map, and they showed up all night long on Channel 5.
And the sixth morning, when Gerard Moussy and Rory McDonald were getting ready for the contractions, looking in Great Britain just rocked when the program changed into Pepp's lead.
Some were disappointed after having spent the sleepless night, deliberately awaiting this fight.
One of the bloggers on Twitter called switching to a kid's cartoon like "someone's stupid joke".
In response to a question about Dave Schwarz's broadcast, Vice President Bellator of Marketing and Communication said, "Agreed, a state order and 6 a.m. this morning, that content was inappropriate and had to switch to a child's program."
"Yes, Lead Pep."
Bellator Scott Coker's president said they would work on a program to integrate British viewers into the future.
"I believe that we will limit the possibility of recurrence, I think, we can solve this question," said Coker.
'But now it's 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, and we're not going to be able to resolve it till Sunday, rather Monday, through their time.
But we're doing everything we can.
Believe me, when the programs were updated we got a lot of messages and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to solve the question by saying that it was a technical error.
But that turned out to be the state order.
I can sort of think of that the next time something like this doesn't happen.
We'd lower the number of contractions from six to five as we normally did it, and this together we wanted to tell the fans but we got too old.
It is a convoluted situation."
"Disk of the Unhungry": Tom Daily felt "significant" because of sexuality
The Olympic ghost in the water, Tom Daley, said that he grew up with a sense of insignificance for others because of his sexuality -- but that gave him motivation in the way of success.
A 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't understand that 'not all are like me' until he went to high school.
Speaking to Radio 4 in Leading Lauren Laverne, he said he supported the rights of the gays to have another "hope".
He also stated that when he had a child, he began to think less about winning the Olympics.
Traditionally attending this pretty old program of Kirsty Young, took a break for a few months because of the illness.
As a human being who turned out to be homeless on the first show in Laverne, Daily said that as a child he felt smaller than anyone else, because "the society didn't take those people who liked boys and girls."
He said, "I now believe that this feeling that you are not as little and as little as anything, was what gave me strength and inspiration for success."
He wanted to prove he was "someone," said he, not to disappoint those who found out about his sexuality.
The two-fold bronzal ghost of the alympics has been made by a significant LGBT activist and the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year urged the country not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said he had his judgment, because he was fortunate enough to live an open life without persecution and wanted to give 'hope' to others.
The three-time champion of the world said that if he fell in love with a man -- an American scriptwriter, director and pre-suspector Dustin Lance Blacke, who he met in 2013 -- "that was unexpected to me."
Daley married the owner of the Oscar who, 20 years older than him, last year, but, he said, the age difference doesn't matter.
"When you're going through this at such a young age" -- at his first alumni he got to be at 14 years old and three years later his father died of a cancer," he said, "it was hard to find a rabies that survived such a flight and a fall.
In June they became fathers, their son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "prospects entirely" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would tell you that I need to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are some things in the world that are more important than the Olympic medal of gold.
Dobi is my golden Olympic medal."
His son's name is also like his father's Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said that his father didn't accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked about was whether they bought the tickets to the London Olympics of 2012--he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him you wouldn't sit in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not immortal," he said.
Next year Daley competed for the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I just knew it was what I wanted my whole life to do," he said.
It also affected the selection of a song -- a stream from Heather Small -- that found in it a feedback signal in preparation for the alumina and from which the ants are now running.

Michaelson, who is not in shape, remains on the bench of the Reider's cup on Saturday
American Phil Michelson played his 47th match on Sunday to Rider's cup, but he needs to get back in shape so that this event doesn't turn out to be an unlucky one.
Michelsan, who will play in this competition, which is held once every two years, is a record 12th time, captain of the Jim Furik team, planted on the bench of the spare on the Sabbath forbola.
Rather than being in the center of the event, and he was often there for the United States team, the five-time winner of the cube shared his days between working a cheerleader and training, hoping to get back into shape.
Even at the peak of his career he wasn't the best player, and now a 48-year-old golfer is not the perfect choice for the unforgivable Le Golf National field, where unpredictable strikes are hard to take.
And when the field itself isn't gloomy enough, Michelson, in his ninth match Sunday, will be fighting against the exact champion of British Open Franceská Malinari, who together with Tommy Flintwood, won all four games this week.
When Americans who stand back on four points at the beginning of the 12 single games start out in success, the Michelsan match may be extremely important.
Fürick showed confidence in this player, but couldn't say anything more.
"He fully understood his role today, stuck me on his back, caught me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Fürick.
'He is very sure of himself.
He was taken to the Hall of Fame and gave a great deal of team last and that week.
Perhaps I did not plan it on two games.
I planned more, but it worked just like that and so we thought we were playing.
He wants to be in the field, too, like all the others."
Michelson will score Nick Fald's high score by the number of games played on Sunday's Richard's cup.
It could be the end of a career to a Raider cup that was never the same as achievements in individual games.
In Michelsan 18 won, 20 lost and seven half, although Furik said his presence brought a team of benefits.
"He's a funny, sarcastic, with humour, loves to sacrifice over people and just a very kind man, whom he should have on the team," he explained.
"I believe that the more young players gladly parried his jokes, too, at that week and that was a good thing to see.
He gives the team much more than a simple game."
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a large gap can quickly disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, has the experience of knowing that a significant hole in the face of individual games of the last day's boxing trip, can easily disappear.
The Dutch player debuted in 1997 in Walderam, where the European team, under Seva Balesteras, had the advantage of five points over Americans, but ended with a minimum of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You're constantly reminding yourself that in Walderam we had a great advantage and a great deal of victory, but with difficulty we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost," said Bjorn after watching how the Class of 2018 team won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and took the number 10-6 on Le Golf National.
"The story shows me and everyone else in the team that it's not over yet.
We have to play all 100 tomorrow.
Quit the box and do everything properly.
Before the eyes appeared in the table, nothing was finished.
So what we have here is this idea that we're going to try to win a trophy right now, and we're going to focus on that.
I keep saying this, I focus on 12 players on our side, but we understand very well that the opposite side is the best players in the world."
Satisfied by the way his players played the heavy golf course, Bjorn added, "I will never overestimate myself in this.
Tomorrow will be another game altogether.
We'll have an individual game tomorrow, so that's different.
Just fine when you're out in the field with a partner and everything goes well, but when you're playing alone, you're just being proved by your true gallop talent.
That's what they have to bring to the players, that they have to show the greatest show tomorrow.
Now we have to leave a partner; we have to go and show everyone else the best as an individual player."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Fürick hopes for the best individual game of his sportsmen than the one they demonstrated in partnership, except for Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who took three points from four.
Fürich himself was on both sides of these matches the last day, playing the winning team in Brooklyn and playing when Europe had the Wonder in the Med.
"I remember every word of this," he said, replying to a question like Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999 had set his players up for the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but always want to have a quick start, which you saw in Brooklyn and in Medina.
When speed increases, the greatest pressure comes from those who play the match in the middle.
We've put together some appropriate schedule and we've put up the players the way we like them, and you know tomorrow we're trying to get some magic."
Thomas got the task to start playing and he talks against Rory MacAllrow in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Roses, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Paulter will play against the toppling thugs.
"I've put my players in such a order, because I think I'll close everything up," Bjorn said about his choice for individual matches.
Run the new German military ship off again
The new WFF frigate Germany had to enter into power in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but it will appear no sooner in the following year because of broken systems and constantly increasing costs, according to local media reports.
The release of Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship's absolutely new class of baden-Wuertemberg frigates, was postponed to the first half of 2019, as reported by the newspaper Die Zeit, quoting a military representative.
The ship was due to come into line in 2014 but the problems that emerged after construction prevent this ambitious project.
The four warships of the Baden-Wuertemberg class, ordered back in 2007, must replace the old Bremen class frigates.
They'll be armed with strong cannons, different anti-ship and anti-aircraft rockets, as well as some of the technologies called "stels", such as reduced vision for radars, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Among other important characteristics – the longer periods between telecommunications – more new frigates may not be covered by their party for up to two years.
However, constant deviations mean that modern battleships -- which allow Germans to demonstrate their power outside the country -- are getting old by the time they finally get into control, notes Die Zeit.
An unfortunate F125 frigate got in the headlines last year when the German IMF officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time in history, the Navy vandalized the ship against the ship after delivery.
For reasons of return, the German media were known to be small, but they were writing about numerous "defects in software security and hardware" that made the ship waste in a combat mission.
The software failures were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuertemberg class ships only have 120 sailors -- half a crew of the old Bremen frigates.
It also found that the ship has a very high weight that reduces its productivity and limits its ability to further update.
Rheinland-Pfalz operates 7,000 tons, which is twice the weight of ships of the same class, which used Germany in World War II.
Apart from the lack of adequate capacity for the entire project, including crew training, there is also a problem.
The price reached an incredible 3.1 billion Euros ($3.6 billion), although it initially amounted to 2.2 billion Euros.
The problems that accumulate with the new frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings about Germany's changing power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Department, stated that the IMF "has increasingly less and less military-powered ships".
He stated that the problem has sometimes been increased, as the old ships are listed, and the ships are not replaced.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuertemberg class frigates were able to join the IMF.
National monumental society has listened to the secret lives of bats
A new study undertaken in the Scottish mountains directed at the discovery of how bats used landscape in hunting for food.
Scientists hope to find something new in the behavior of unique flying mammals and to help in the future actions to save these animals.
Research by scholars of the National Society for the Conservation of Monuments of Scotland is carried out by small bats and also by long-lived Dabanton bats in the gardens of the Invertia in Western Rhodes.
Special writing tools will be placed in the principal locations of this locality, to monitor the bat activity during the season.
Society and volunteer workers will be able to mobile research using manual detectors.
An expert analysis of the sounds of all the records determines the frequency of the calls made by the bats, and also of the ones being told what to do.
A habitat map and report will be used to create more information about the behaviour of these animals in this landscape.
Rob Dewar, a consultant for the National Society for Conservation of Nature, hopes that the results will show what areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information helps to determine the advantages of creating habitats such as meadows and how to support the forests of bats and other animals associated with them.
The number of stories in Scotland and in Great Britain has fallen significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by the construction and developmental works which affect and destroy the habitats.
Winds of turbines and lighting can be risky, too, like sticky feed for flies and some chemicals for building materials, and they're threatened by domestic cats.
Tellers not at all blind.
However, because of their nightly lives, the ears talk more sensitive than the eyes, when a saying comes about hunting.
They use complex inhalation techniques to detect bugs and obstacles to the flight's path.
The national society, which is responsible for more than 270 buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious about bats.
It employs ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, research into areas of survival and, sometimes, rescue activities.
An organization has even created the first and only Scottish conservationists mentioned in the coin of Troy in Humphreys and Galaways, where eight of ten species live in the bats of Scotland.
The head of the tapestry, David Thompson, says, "This is the perfect territory for bats."
"Here, at Troy, we have just a great place for bats," he said.
"We have an old building, a lot of old trees and a very good place to live.
But we don't know much about talkers yet, so our work here and in other coins will help them understand that they need it for a better life."
It emphasizes the importance of checking for bats before carrying out the repair of property, as one seat can be accidentally destroyed, killing up to 400 females and young bats, which will lead to the complete destruction of local populations.
They are under their tails and are forbidden to kill, frighten, disturb or destroy their seats.
Elisabeth Feral, an organization's hedgehog worker in Scotland, is urging the public to help in this matter.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and many of the species we don't even know how to live their populations."
The ranaldo charges rape, and his lawyers are about to sue him for a German log.
The Christman of the Morning called it accusing him of raping "affect news," saying that people want to "reprove themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue on a German magazine, Der Spiegel, which published these charges.
The formation of the archbishop of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping American Catherine Mayor's room in Los Vegas in 2009.
Then he, if he paid her $375,000 for silence, wrote Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a video Instagram Live 33-year-old Ranaldu turned to 142 million of his subscribers a few hours after he published the advertisements, calling this message "feeling news".
«No, no, no, no, no.
Today's messages are fictitious news,' said the gold ball owner five times in front of the camera.
"They want to make an advertisement on my behalf.
It's okay.
They want to be known by mentioning my name but this part of my work.
I am a happy and kind man," he added with a smile.
Randou's lawyers are preparing a case in a court of law against Der Spiegel's magazine on charges that called "an incorrect report of private suspicions," reports Reuters.
Counsel Christian Schertz stated that the player will seek compensation for "the moral damage in the amount which reflects the severity of the infringement, and in recent years this may be the most serious personal rights abuse."
It was as if the incident took place in June 2009 in the luxury house room "Palms Howell and Kassinov" in Las Vegas.
Meeting at a nightclub of Ronaldo and Majorgo would have gone back to the footballist's room, where he would have raped her anally, as written in the documents of the district court of Clark County in the state of Nevada.
Majorga claims that after that he shut down Rando and said that he's a good guy at 99 percent who suffers from one percent.
The documents said that Ronaldo admitted that they had sex, but on the consent of the parties.
Majorga also claims to have gone to the police and taken pictures of the damage to the hospital, but then agreed to a restraining order because she was very afraid of revenge and was worried that she would be "publicly taken".
A 34-year-old woman says she wants to reopen her indictment because she feels a moral trauma for that incident.
In an hour if there was a case in which Ranaldo was going to move to the Madrid Raal from Manchester United, and that summer he moved to the Juventus Italian, closing the deal into 100 million Euros.
Brixite: United Kingdom will always regret it.
Great Britain is always sorry when it loses its world leader in car construction after Brexit, said business minister Greg Clark.
He added that he "needed" a statement from Toyota UK to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without agreement, then the company temporarily cut production off from the background in Bernaston, near Derby in half.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
A Japanese car manufacturer said it caused a delay in the margins as a result of Brexit without any agreement could lead to the shrinking of jobs.
The factory in Bernaston -- where Toyota Auris and Avensis were built -- has released nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries in the Euro-Assa.
"In my opinion, when Britain gets out of the EU at the end of March, the production on our case stops," said Marvin Cook, director Toyota in Bernaston.
Other UK car manufacturers raised the question of how to make a cross-border trade when Britain leaves the EU without a guess, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims to close its Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern is that car builders talk about risking supply chains as a result of Brexit without a guess.
Toyota's production line works on the basis of "exactly within" when spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers both in Great Britain and in the EU for custom cars.
If Great Britain on March 29th leaves the EU without agreement, there may be obstacles at borders leading to the arrest and lack of parts.
For Toyota, it will not be possible to keep on entering the Derbys for more than a day's worth of parts, a company applied to it, so the production will stop.
Mr Clark stated that "Plan Chackers" of Teresa May's future relationship with the EU is "made exactly to avoid these checks at the borders".
"We need a guess. We want to get the best match that will not only allow us to succeed today, but also let us use this opportunity," he said in the BBC Radio 4 software.
"The information we get not only from Toyota, but from other producers, indicates that we should be able to continue working on successful supply chains."
The Toyota company was unable to report how long it would take them to manufacturing, but on the contrary, it warned that adding value would reduce factory competitiveness and would reduce jobs.
Peter Cjolaris, who works in Bernaston for 24 years and is the head of the union, said that the members of the union are very concerned, "By my way, when jobs are cut short, they're no longer renewed.
The secretary-general of the government said, "We have proposed a precise plan of our future relations with the EU, which deserves trust."
The White House states that a Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again
A very important meeting between Donald Trump and Prosecutor-General Rod Rosenstein could be "deployed for a week", while fighting around the candidacy in the Supreme Court of Breta Cavanaugh, said Sunday as representative of the White House.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller's special counsel, who learns how to vote for Russia, the association of the Trampo assistants with Russia, and the potential obstacle to justice from the president.
Free Trump's assistant attorney-General or not, and thus put under threat of Mueller's independence, for months sets oil on fire by yourington gossip.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of taking a hidden microphone to record a conversation with Trump, and it was possible to end the president with a turn of 25.
Don't be ridiculous. Don't be ridiculous. Don't be ridiculous.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid rumors of what was going to fall in retirement.
Instead, it was announced that Thursday would meet Trump, who was at AAN headquarters in New York.
Trump said he "don't want to" to get Rosenstein out, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a hearing in the Senate Law Department where Cavanaugh spoke and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blacey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate for a week against the Cavanaugh, which further slowed down the Senate vote.
Trampa's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on a Sunday news show.
When she was asked about meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date before it was scheduled, maybe next week, maybe next week, and I think that, rather, a week later, she would take into account all the other things that happened in the Supreme Court case.
But everything will happen, and I'm always giving the press the most new information."
Some journalists are ready to deny her certification: Sanders hasn't been conducting a briefing for press at the White House since 10 September.
The Leading Program, Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the rareness of the briffings is not to be scorned by public broadcasters, though she said, "I'll recapture the fact that they're working in public."
Then she said that the immediate contact with the Trump and the press would increase.
"The president meets more with questions of the press than any president he has before him," she said, adding without specific facts, "We have learned those figures."
Britting happens, Sanders reported, but "when the press has a chance to directly ask questions to the President of the United States, it's much better than doing it through me.
We've been trying to do this a lot, and you've seen, as we've been doing this for the last few weeks, and this is a meeting where you can ask the question directly to the president, to replace the brimmings."
The Trump regularly answers the questions when it leaves the White House or takes part in meetings in the street, or in press conferences with high foreign guests.
The self-presiding press conference is rarely held.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why, when he appeared in front of reporters freely and occasionally extravagantly.
The health minister wrote to EU workers in the health care system in Scotland before Brexit
The health minister wrote to EU workers working on health care in Scotland to express thanks for the country's name and wish they stayed after Brexit.
Jan Freeman sent a letter less than half an hour to leave the EU of Great Britain.
The Scottish government is already ready to cover the cost of live requests from EU citizens working in the state services of the country.
In her letter Mrs. Freeman wrote: "Fears have continued talks between Great Britain and the EU on the way out of our country, and they lead to the expected solutions of this fall.
But the British government also hastened a preparations for the script without agreement.
I know that for all of you it's a very restless time.
So what I want to remind you is how much I am the price of every employee's contribution, regardless of their nationality.
My colleagues from all the EU countries and not only do they give valuable experience and skills that enhance and perfect health services, also bring benefit to the patient and our community.
Scotland is your house and we want you to stay with us very much."
Christian Abercrombie has moved the terminal operation on after head trauma.
Tennessee State Tigers Christian Abercrombie moved the terminal operation after he had received a third head in a Sunday match, which his team played 31-27 with Vanderbilt Commodores, reporting Mike Organ from Tennessee.
The main coach Tennessee State Rod Read told the reporter that a injured player had received a short time before the break.
"He has moved on to a sideline and suddenly he has dropped," said Reed.
Coaches and medics gave Oberkombi acid yet on the field before putting it upon the violence and carried it to settle the diagnosis.
Professor Tennessee State told Chris Harris from the WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harness added that there was no 'needle about what it was a trauma', and Tennessee State was trying to find out when the player got injured.
Obercombe, a second-year sportsman, holds the first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
By the time he left the game on Saturday, he had made five full wins, which gives only 18 wins of the season.
Foreign buyers of the British real estate will pay more post
In line with the new plans of conservatives, foreign buyers in the British real estate will pay higher fees, and extra money will go to help the homeless
This action neutralises the success of the Corbin initiative for attracting young voters
Increased public service obligations are imposed on those who do not pay taxes in Great Britain
The Ministry of Finance plans to receive up to 120 million pounds a year in support of the homeless
Today, Teresa May claims that foreign buyers in the British real estate will pay for a larger government shipment, and extra money will go to help the homeless.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of the Jeremy Corbin initiative in attracting young voters, as well as still available housing, which is directed at people with high incomes.
The increase in government sales is directed at persons and firms that don't pay taxes in the UK and the money will go to a government housing grant program that is homeless.
An increase in current state turnover, including higher levels, taken two years ago, for the purchase of second houses and residence for rent, could amount to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes to get up to £120 million a year.
The estimates of 13 percent of London's new constructions are bought by non-residents of Great Britain, which will lead to higher prices and new buyers being made difficult to buy their first residence.
Many rich regions of the country, especially the capital, have become "privileged towns," because a large number of customers are, for most of the time, not living in Britain.
A new policy came up literally a few weeks after Barry Johnson's call to reduce the government's mail to young buyers to facilitate the acquisition of the first residence.
He accused the violent construction firms of maintaining a high price on the immovable property by seizing and non-utilising the land, and urged Mistress May to cancel the quota on an accessible dwelling to make the "disgusting position of the dwelling" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin has announced a series of lively reforms including rent control and uninhabited emigration.
He also wants the local council to hand over more powers to housing.
Miss May said: "Last year, I said that I will dedicate my work to the Prime Minister's restoration of the British dream -- a life for every new generation must be better.
That means improving our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live here, work here, and build their lives.
It is, however, unfair that persons who do not live in the UK and foreign companies can buy real estate as easily as the workers of Britain's inhabitants.
For too many people's dream of having their own home is becoming increasingly impervious, and the problem of the homeless remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My main ambition is to manage the Scottish congregation"
Jack Ross, a Sanderland coach, stated that his primary ambition was ever going to be a coach of the Scottish Congregation.
The 42-year-old Scottishman is doing the task of restoring the club from the north-east, which is now in the third place of the First League, in the three points of the first.
He moved on to this work in the summer after he returned Saint-Mieren to the Scottish Premier League in the past season.
"I wanted to speak for my country as a player.
But it couldn't," said Ross in passing the BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"I grew up often sick of Scotland at the Hampton Stadium with my father, and something always made me come back.
However, such an opportunity will appear if I am a successful nightclub coach."
Among Rosa's predecessors, Dick Adwakatt, David Moss, Sam Aladeys, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poye, and Paul de Cania.
There was a coach named Aloa Atletik that said he didn't feel afraid of such famous names in such a big club that he had previously turned down proposals from Barnesley and Ipsvit Tavn.
"Now good luck to me will be the answer to the question 'if I can turn this club back to Prime Minister League?'
According to the structure and the material base of the club his place must have been in the Prime Minister of the League," he said.
"Not just return him to it, but I will consider my work successful only if I can go back to the club. "
Ross only worked three years as a coach, he was a coach's assistant at Dumbarton, and 15 months worked at Harts' training headquarters.
Then he helped Aloa get back from the third league and turned the Saint-Mieren from a loser who almost got into the championship in winning the next season.
Ross says it feels more comfortable now than during his career at Clyde, Hartlpool, Falcon, Saint-Mieren, and Hamilton Academy.
Looking back at the work at "Hello," he said, "It was a really important choice."
"I really believed that coaching is what I need, even more than the game.
It sounds amazing because I've worked well, well earned it, and reached a certain height.
But the game can be tough.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
I'm going through this now when you talk about stress and pressure, but coaching is something that needs to be done.
I always wanted to train and now I do it, and for me it's the best time of all my adult life."
You can listen to the full interview on Saturday, 30 September at Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 under the British Summer Time
So we're looking at the perfect time to have a pint of beer on Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The hot summer increased the profits of the British pubs, which struggle for survival, but brought pressure on the network of restaurants.
According to statistics from the group of pubs and bariums, sales increased by 2.7 percent in lichens, but in restaurants the sales volume decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the AGA advisory business group, who was collecting this statistic, stated: "The solar weather is running and it's longer than expected that the English conglomerate participated in the Champions World final, means that the gluten was doing what was going on in June when the Fads increased sales by 2.8 percent, and that's how the retarded suffered even more.
The lower sales in restaurants by 1.8 percent in June just got worse in July.
So the stuff and the bars that mostly sell drinks until they showed the best result, unlike restaurants.
The foods that sell more were also taken care of in the sun, though not as much as the restaurant.
It looks like people just wanted to drink.
In pubs and bars, drinks have grown by 6.6 percent, and food has dropped by three percent."
Paul Neumann, an RSM analyst for rest and placement, said, "These results are going to be a trick that we're seeing from the end of the April.
In the face of and the impact of important social and sporting events, the most important factors remain when talking about sales volumes on the market for public food.
No wonder restaurants keep fighting, because sales have fallen by 4.8 percent a year, and it's very unpleasant to keep rising costs.
The long and hot summer came in as bad as possible for operators who are concentrated on food, and the time will show whether the lower temperatures in August will bring such a anticipated relief."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including recently open, was in the height of 2.7 percent, reflecting the slowdown in the expansion of brands.
A sales tracking tool in British pubs, bars and restaurants, Cooper Peach Tracker collects and analyzes the productivity data from 47 active groups that have a total turnover of £9 billion, and is an important shareholder of this industry.
Every fifth child has a secret account in a network which he hides from his parents
The study showed that every fifth child -- one has only 11 -- has secret accounts in social media that hide it from parents and teachers
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in fun Insta pages
It's the news that's embodies the fears that the sexual content of
Twenty percent of students said they had "essential" accounts showing their parents
Every fifth child -- one has just 11 -- creates accounts in social media that keeps them secret from parents.
A study of 20,000 middle school students found the rapid growth in Insta's "feature" accounts -- as if they were using Instagram to exchange pictures.
And the news is that it's full of fears that sexual content is published there.
Twenty percent of students said they were keeping 'clean 'accounts to show their parents, and they also kept private accounts.
One mother, who happened to find a secret site for her 13-year-old daughter, found out that she had called on the others to "to rape me".
A study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40 percent of teenagers between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them admitted that they had secret accounts.
Head HMC Mike Buchanan said, "It's very worrying that so many teenagers want to create places on the Internet where neither their parents nor teachers can find them."
Emilid Doyle will be the "sporter's voice" in the Scottish light-tailed satin.
Elied Doyle was elected to the Scottish council of athletics as an observer member of the world at the annual general meeting of this body.
Doyle is the most titled satellite in Scotland and Chief Ian Beatie has described this event as a great opportunity for sports leaders to derive a lot of benefits from her experience at various levels, including the international one over the last decade.
'Elid enjoys a great respect in Scotland, in Great Britain and in a globally competitive community, and we're sure that an athlete in Scotland will get a lot of good from her work in the world,' said the Beat.
Doyle said, "I want to act as a sportsman's voice, and I hope I can help manage sports in Scotland."
An American who won gold at 200 and 400 metres in the 1996 Olympics in the Atlance, and two other gold medals at the other Olympics, and who now works for the BBC experts, can't walk after having survived the micro-surgeon.
And he wrote on Twitter, "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said they'd be showing me how much I'd like to go.
It was a hard job, but I'm totally improved, and I'm back learning how to walk, and now I'm doing life-long exercises!
Thank you for your support messages!"
A low- pumped bicycle, where mothers compare with cows, shared their sentences on the internet
The company in producing tiny pumps divided its judgment by releasing an advertisement that compares nursing women with cows to babies.
To mark the launch of what is called the world's first wearing a small pump, a consumer company named Elvie released an ironic music advertisement at the base of a video to show the freedom that this tool gives to a nursing mother.
The four true mothers dance in quarrelling with cows under the song, where there are these words, 'Yes, I give myself; but the tail is not' and 'In case you haven't noticed, this don't trade, this is my breast.'
And he sang, "Dai, dai, I feed the children, dai, dai, I give my women."
But an advertisement that was placed on the Facebook page of a company- -provided a hot discussion on the Internet.
And 77,000 views and hundreds of comments -- and the video response was ambiguous, so many people said it was a horror of small production.
"A really bad decision to use cows to advertise this production.
Like us, they have to obliterate and breed to give milk, here is only their children to pick after a few days," one observer wrote.
Elvie small pump is undetected hidden in the buds for feeders (Elvie/Mother)
One more comment: “It was traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not use them for an advertisement with a small pump for mothers who don't take away children?"
Someone said, "This is a thoughtless advertisement."
Others defended the advertisement, and one woman wrote that they thought it was a forgetful song.
"I think that's a genius idea.
I'd like to have one if I had breast-feed.
suctioning the milk makes me feel brown.
This advertisement is a bit crazy, but I liked it.
This is a genius," she wrote.
One comment was: “A very entertaining advertisement directed at mothers who suck away the milk pump (sometimes at work or in the toilet) and hear themselves as ‘kings’.
It doesn't endorse and condemn small-scale industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that they were all dancing with invisible little pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of an advertising company is based on the fact that many women who use small pumps feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump pump is completely nonsensical, has neither rights nor pipes and is invisibly concealed in bras for nursing women, gives women freedom of movement, allows them to keep their children and even leave the house while working.
Ana Balarene, a partner and a creative director of the company, Mother, observed: "Elvie Pump is so revolutionary that it deserves an explicit and effective start.
By making a parallel between nursing women and the tiny cows we wanted to pay attention to sucking the milk and its difficulties, while demonstrating in a superstitious and good-natured way the new little pump would bring about extraordinary freedom of movement.
It's not the first time that the Elvie pump has been keeping track.
During the London week of fashion, the mother of two children appeared on the floor in clothes from Martha Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children, without much noise, are transferred to a Texas-line prison camp
While the number of border crossings per month has nearly changed, a sharp increase in the number of detained migrant children has partly caused this to serve as a hard rhetoric and policy led by the Trump administration, which has limited the placement of children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are immigrants, who are afraid to put themselves under threat of being held in charge of their own country, taking responsibility for their child.
Risks have grown considerably in June, when federal authorities have announced that a potential donor and other adult members of households will need to pay back their fingerprints, and they will be handed over to immigration authorities.
During the past week, Matthew Olbens, a high-ranking immigration and customs officer, spoke to Congress about the arrests of dozens of people who have responded to the request to sponsor minors without escort.
Later, the agency reported that 70% of those arrested had previously had no convictions.
"About 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or members of their households are illegal in the country, and a lot of them are foreigners with criminal backgrounds.
So we continue to persecute such people," said Mr. Olbens.
To speed up the work of children, the officials introduced new rules requiring some to appear in court within a month of the date of the arrest, while, according to the employees' words, a pre-standard period of 60 days.
A large number of people have to use video communication to make statements about their legal status as immigration judges, rather than being present in court personally.
Those that care about having no basis for being helpful are quickly deported.
According to the workers' comments, shelters and messages from sources in the system that have appeared in recent months than the children remain in prison, are the higher chances of being depressed or of increasing restlessness, which may lead to violent explosions or attempts to escape.
Lawyers claim that in larger institutions such as Tarnilles, these problems are much stronger, as the signs that a child is in a hot state are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the establishment.
They add that moving children into a city without giving them time for emotional preparations or for a break-up with their friends can make it worse for the trauma that many and so many of them already face.
Syria demands an immediate withdrawal from the US, France and Turkey
In response to the AAN General Assembly, Walid Al-Mualem, Minister for Foreign Affairs, also urged Syrian refugees to return home in spite of the war that continues in the eighth year's country.
Mualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign powers are illegal in the Syrian land, on the basis of the fight against terrorism, and "they will be considered accordingly".
'They must leave immediately and set no terms,' he said at the meeting of the Assembly.
Mualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, as of 2011, millions of people have had to leave their homes, “war on terror is almost over”.
He reported that Damascus intends to continue "to carry on this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territory" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
There are about 2,000 U.S. soldiers in Syria who mostly act as instructors and advocates of the strengths of the Kurds and Syrian Arabs, who are in opposition to the President of Bashar Assad.
France's ground contingent in this decomposed war country consists of more than 1,000 soldiers.
On the issue of refugees, Mualem stated that conditions for return are favourable and accused of "some Western countries" in "the spread of irrational fears", which limit refugees to.
"We call on the international community and the humanities to contribute to their return," he says.
"They politicize the exclusively humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be provided with help in updating until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
The AAN diplomats report that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last violent resistance of the Idlibe rebels created an opportunity to hold political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement presupposes a large-scale offensive of Syrian forces supported by Russia into a province where the surviving three million people lived.
But Mualem stressed that the agreement had "accurate deadlines", and hoped that military action would be directed against the Jihadists, including Al-Qaida-related activists from the Nussre front, who were "to be destroyed".
Ambassador AAN Stefan de Mystura hopes soon to convene the first meeting of the new committee to introduce government and opposition representatives to devise a post-trial constitution for Syria and to put the way of the elections.
Mualem indicated the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Bureau, stating that the commission's work should be limited to “observation of articles of the operating constitution”, and prevention from interference.
Why does Trump go on second term?
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 elections, when, as many liberal viewers hope, impeachment and scandal will not be over in the future.
And that will no doubt be “the very dramatic finale of the presidency as a whole! ”
At the moment there is no sign of weariness.
Since 2014, ratings have grown more than twice as high as 1.05 million on CNN and nearly three times up to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, on the average of 2.4 million viewers in the stream, compared to 1.7 million people in the previous four years, while The Rachel Maddow Show broadcast the MSNBC channel gathered 3.5 million viewers on the screen and passed the cable television rating in the evening when it was broadcast the main news.
"It's the fire that people are reaching out to because we don't understand it," says Neil Burr, director of the ABC drama "Perivenaire" about a cabinet member who becomes President after an attack that destroyed the Capitol.
In Nellie Rockwell, a grotesque scripting comedy and author of the book A Time of Ridiculous detail and a couple of hard stories about getting into a club of Hollywood boys, there's another theory.
She mentions a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her she would vote for Mr. Trump.
- Why?' she asked.
And he said, "Because he looks down on me," -- said Miss Scully.
Chaos is precious also what can amuse.
Of course, unlike all the other television, the plot lines that get out of Washington can become as marked a future as the "Row Against Wade" issue, depending on whether the families of immigrants can unite and healthy the world economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you watch the sixth hour that a group of experts discusses using Bob Woodward's "information not to print" in the Scar book, Paul Monofort's jacket for 15,000 dollars with curvature of skin (as well as elevating hospitality as they wrote in The Washington Post), and the consequences of the sharp descriptions of St. Daniels, um, anatomy of Mr. Trump, that goes for the simple framework of wanting to be in the background.
I'll never, for example, look at Super Mario just as I used to.
"The amount of what he's doing makes you feel as if you watch the reality show he shows every evening," says Brent Mantomer, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and "Pawn Stars" creator of the changing action composition of the Trump show and the constant plot twists of "Sparing" with the NFL, and "Kim Chen Yin".
You can't afford to skip even one episode, or you're going to fall back.
When I spoke to Mr. Flays this week, behind the windows of his house on the north bank of the Coway stood a brisk sunny day and 30 degrees warm, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC while writing CNN.
He could not depart, not when Brett Cavanaugh stood before the Senate Court Bureau, discussing the future of the Supreme Court, which hung upon a hair.
"I remember the kids when we published those crazy shows, and people said, "It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr. Flays.
'I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.'

External cash flows are included in the hard forward-select race of intermediate elections to the House of Representatives
Surprisingly, the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania has discovered a cash surplus thanks to the change in county boundaries made by Congress, which is why two candidates stand alone in elections.
The newly scaled Pizzburg suburbs are surrounded by a democrat, a member of the House of Representatives Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district on the precipice of the past spring.
Lambo opposes another deputate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new 17th.
The cards were scaled down after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in the cold established that the voices of the old districts were unconstitutionally counted for the benefit of the republicans.
A re-elected race in the new 17th district sparked a decline in funding for the company's main parties' financial groups, the CDC and the National Bureau of the Republican Company (NCRC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a difficult win on a wide-ranging truce in the 18th district of Pennsylvania in March.
It's been in the Republican district for more than ten years now, and President Donald Trump has won the 20-point district.
Political experts have a low priority for democracy.
U.S. Estimated the possibility of punishing El Salvador for China's support and then retreated.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already maintained their position in Beijing, despite a slight opposition from Washington, D.C.
Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with the president, Mr. Juan Carlos Warel, in June 2017, and settled into a hotel in Panama until the partners moved out of the Trump Steering Team.
The participants in the State Department decided to call off American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in connection with "the recent decisions on Taiwan's non-recognition", said a secretary-general of the State Department of Heather Nawert earlier this month.
However, sanctions were considered only in relation to El Salvador, which received about 140 million dollars of American aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country with its high level of unemployment and homicide.
In addition to the completion of internal meetings, representatives of the North and Central America held the conference on a high level, dedicated to security and economic prosperity, which would become a lengthy similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in efforts to prevent immigration into the United States.
But to the middle of September the high officials in charge continued to understand that they wanted the conference to take place and actually stopped considering the issue of El Salvador's punishment.
According to the diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pennsylvania will now speak at a conference to be held at the middle of October, signalling that the administration is in favour of taking action.
And the three American messengers, without any unnecessary noise, returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new harsh messages or punishment from Washington.
The White House vendor Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate which were described by the three American officials, including the two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues when saving anonymity.
Their messages are confirmed by others, close to the administrator of analysts, who also wanted to remain anonymous.

The next step may be to report to Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible obstacle to justice for Mr. Trump, about examples of what is currently having very difficult evidence in the documents of the public character.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller paid attention in the investigation to the possibility of a contract company called Trump and Russia in an attack on elections.
When Congress will change the landlord, Mr. Trump will find himself in front of the face of responsibility to this body, just as he is preparing to speak again to the voters, and perhaps finally, to the jury before his colleague's number.
There's a lot of 'rounds' and I don't want to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, just like him in Europe.
All of us, on either side of the Atlantic, must make a choice which determines how long it will take to fight.
In 1938 the German officers were ready for a coup d'état against Hitler, if only West had shown him resistance and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and lost our ability to avoid the following years of blood work.
The story twists around similar crucial moments, and the inexorable march of democracy accelerates or sets off.
Right now Americans have encountered a few of those crucial moments.
What happens when Mr. Trump is freer to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein turned out to be in a difficult position since the gas wrote about what he had written last year, suggested that he write in secret President's words and pondered his ability.
Mr. Rosenschenna said the "The Times" message was incorrect.
"How will we react when the recent FBI investigation into the Brett Cavanaugh case is not omnipotent or fair, or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court, in spite of the worth of confidence in allegations of sexual violence and misbehaviour?
And first of all, will we vote in elections for Congress, which will drag Mr. Trump to responsibility?
If we don't pass those trials, for democracy the long winter comes.

Graham Dorans of Rangers is optimistic about the front page of a Rapid Vienna match.
Rangers take Raid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that I'm going to win over the Austrians after an exciting night's sleep in Spain over the Villareal earlier this month, allowing them to safely leave the G League of Europe group.
The three-wheeled knee prevented Grim Dorans from performing for the first time in the season until night two or two with William, but he believed that Rangers would be able to take advantage of this as a tramp.
"It was a substantial match for us, because Willerial is a strong opponent," said a 31-year-old football player.
"We started the game thinking we could get something, and we made a point.
Perhaps at the end we could have killed a ball, but generally nothing also became a good result.
They were looking better in the first time, but in the second we took ourselves together, and we had the best half of the field.
On Thursday another night's European football will take place.
Hopefully we can earn three points, but that's a complex game, because they've shown a good result in the last game, but given the crowd of fans on the stands, I'm sure we'll be able to deal with them and show them a good game.
Last year was determined to be heavy, both because of my injuries and the change in the club itself, but now we have a factor of confidence.
A good team, and the guys are really enjoying the game; training is productive.
Hopefully we'll be able to move forward, move through the result of the last season and succeed."
Women lose sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the participants in the interview had a clear idea of what they wanted to be cared for, few of them talked about it with members of their families.
About half the people who participated in the general study reported having talked to their husbands about the basket of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but don't take steps to discuss it," says Holly Snyder, vice-president of the "Nationweed" for the fear of life.
Here's what it takes to start.
Give it up with your husband and children: your family will not be ready to help you if you advance not to answer your wishes.
So you need to work with your consultant and your family and discuss where and how to get medical attention, because this can become an important factor in determining the cost.
Bring in the discussion of a financial consultant. It can also help you find a way to pay these expenses.
Your long-term insurance policy can include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that will help cover these expenses, or you can self-insured your life -- provided you have the money.
Decide what happens with legal instruments: prejudge the battles.
Receive trust in medical services to provide a trusted person with control over your medical services and to provide support for your performance by the specialists in your requests, in case you cannot speak.
Besides, consider the possibility of issuing confidence in financial management.
Assign a trusted person to make financial decisions and to provide you with secure payment of your accounts, if you are unsure.
Don't forget about the details: imagine that your elderly father needs immediate medical attention, and he is on his way to the hospital.

In an Ilfracombe in a man several times shot with a pneummatic screwdriver
The man got some hits with a pneumatic vintage when he was going home at night.
Alive for 40 years, it was in the District of Oxford Grove in Ilfracomb, County Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly, and arm.
The police officers described the shooting which took place around 02:30 a.m. in local time as a "accidental event".
The affected one could not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life threats, the police are asking witnesses to contact them.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
According to the official languages, at least 384 people were killed as a result of the mighty earthquake and tsunami that fell on the Indonesian town of Palu on Friday, and it is expected that the number of dead adults was lost.
As a result of the disconnection of the relations of the civil servants involved in the aid, no information could be obtained from the Dongala registrar, north of Palu, near the 7.5 points of force earthquake epicentre.
In Palo, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after a cold disaster.
Here are some of the key facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulava:
The peninsula is the capital of Central Suloveni Province, which is located at the end of the narrow cove on the western coast of the island of Sulava, with the estimated population of 379,800 people for 2017.
When the earthquake occurred and the tsunami came, the town celebrated the 40th anniversary of the founding.
The Dongala is a registrar that stretches along over 180 miles (300 km) of the coastline in the north-west of the Suloves Islands.
The government office was lower than its national level in 2017. It had 299,200 people.
Fisheries and the rural economy are the foundation of the economics of Central Swaziland's rule, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
The supply of nickel is also important for the province, but mainly concentrated in Moravia, on the opposite coast of Slovenia.
According to the data from the Indonesian Agency for the Mitigation of the Constituents of the Droughts, Palo and Dongala have been hit several times over the last 100 years by the tsunami.
In 1938 in Dongala, over 200 people were killed by the tsunami, hundreds of houses destroyed.
And the tsunami also hit the western part of Dongala in 1996, resulting in nine deaths.
India is in a seismic-active Pacific fiery ring and it regularly rocked by earthquakes.
Below is a list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on the north of Sumatra on the 26th of December caused by the tsunami, which struck 14 countries, resulting in the death of 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March- at the start of April.
Hundreds of people died on the coast of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Magnitude earthquake of 6.8 took place south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, causing the tsunami that struck on the south coast, resulting in the loss of some 700 people.
2009: In Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra government, there was an earthquake of 7.6 points.
Over 1,100 people have died.
2010: The 7.5-ball earthquake took place on one of the islands of Mentava outside Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck on Jay's sub-region in the province of Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people are reminded of the devastation resulting from the 2004 and Tsunami earthquake.
This time the tsunami didn't come, but more than 100 people died under the ruins of buildings.
2018: The strong earthquake struck the tourist islands of Indonesia by Lamboc, resulting in over 500 deaths, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists without being able to leave.

As to the police report, when a familiar one tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, he picked up a phone.
On the way to the KTUU channel, Paylin is now under the $500 bet on the Matanuska-Suite facility.

Pail's charge is for three class A arrests, for which he is threatened with imprisonment for one year and a fine of $250,000.
He's also accused of committing a class B crime, which is governed by day-warning and a fine of 2,000 dollars.
It wasn't the first time a prosecution had been brought against Paelyn.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Paylin,
His mother, Sarah Payne, called the police to tell her about the alleged attack.
The matter is now being examined by the Alaska Veterans' court.
In January 2016 he received charges in domestic violence, forgeries on domestic violence, and forgeries on the family's report on weapons storage as an alcoholic charge in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Paylin was criticized by the Veterans' Group in 2016 for the severe behaviour of her son with post-traumatic syndrome caused by his service to Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia, tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people died as a result of the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Suloves on Friday.
The 7.5-point earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and networks are down, and it is expected that within the next few days, you will have an increase in the number of victims.
The earthquake took place near the central embassy, which is in the northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Social networks have distributed videos that show a moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami struck the shore.
Federal prosecution requires rarely death row for terrorist suspects in New York City
The federal prosecution in New York is seeking the death penalty for Siful Saipawa, suspected of being in terror in New York City, resulting in eight people being killed -- a rare punishment that hasn't been used in the form of federal crimes since 1953.
Saipla, 30 years old, in October, seemed to have taken advantage of the home Depot truck to take a guided road along the West Side highway in Nigim Manhattan, beating pedestrians and rowists on its way.
To defuse the death penalty, as a result of an announcement of intent to obtain the death penalty set out in the South District of New York, prosecutors must prove that Saipla 's deliberately' beat eight people and 'intelligently' caused serious bodily harm.
According to the court's materials, for both dismissals a possible penalty of death is punishable.
A few weeks after the attack, the big feudal jury follows the charge against Saipawa by bringing in 22 counts, which included eight charges of homicide to support a raid; this item is commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of transport assets.
According to prosecutors, the attack required “a careful and deliberate planning”, and describing the crime committed by Soipa, using phrases such as “abominable, fierce and inflamed”.
"Sifula Habibulavich Saipola caused injuries, hurt and lost families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ana-Laura Decadet, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlia, Hernan Fercú, Hernan Diego Mendas and Alejandro Damien Pagnuk," said in a statement of intent.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
Since the last commencement of a criminal case with a death penalty measure in South New York, it's been ten years now.
The respondent, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but the final result was devoted to a life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was applied in New York on a federal case in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been punished after being sentenced two years earlier for conspiracy to spy on the benefit of the Soviet Union during the cold war.
A Rosenberg pair was punished in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipla, an outsider from Uzbekistan, agrees with the judicial documents, demonstrated the absence of reprimands in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he stated that he was the follower, who felt satisfied with his act.
According to the news release, Cyprus reported to the authorities that he had been attacked by a video viewer from the Islamic State on the phone.
He also asked for permission to hang the flag of the Islamic State in a hospital palace reported to the police.
He would not plead guilty to an indictment conclusion made up of 22 points.
David Patan, one of the federal civil defenders who represents Saipawa, said they were "remarkably disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the solution to the death penalty, not the life imprisonment without parole, will only extend the pain from these events to all participants," said Patan.
The Saipawa defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek execution.
A member of Parliament from Torah said that Nigel Faraj should schedule a speech on Brexit.
Today, during a protest at a conference at the Torah's party, Nigel Faraj vowed to "mobilize the people's army".
There was a leader in Ukip who said politicians should "relieve the discomfort" from Eurosceptics -- because a member of the Teresa May Parliament offered his candidacy for EU speech.
Peter Boone, a member of parliament from a party of conservators, said during a march in Birmingham that the UK would have "come out" had Mr. Farage taken the position of secretary after Brexit.
But the problem that Lady May has faced in trying to reconcile her disparate supporters has worsened when the Torahs, who are in favour of preserving EU membership, have set up a separate protest against Brexite in the city.
The Prime Minister is working hard to keep up the compromise Checker Agreement under constant pressure from supporters and workers out there, as well as from the EU itself.
The Allies are insisting on trying to close the deal with Brucell in spite of an immediate reaction, and are trying to get euphetists and lawyers to choose between her package and her mess.
Mr. Boone said that he wanted to "drop a hacker out of the board" at a rally in Salihal.
He suggested that Mr. Faradge make an equal and shouldering of the obligation to speak with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we'd already come out," he said.
A member of parliament from Welingbor said, "I'm behind Brexit, but we need to get away from the Checker Plan."
Speaking against the EU, he said, "We have not been the biggest war in the world to be dependent.
We want to implement our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Boone rejected the notion that the social idea changed after the 2016 voting: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely out of line with reality."
Brixita's supporters and Torah's member, Andrea Jenkins, were also on the march, and the journalist said, "I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to people.
"The hacking plan is unpopular among the wide audience, the opposition is not going to vote for it; it's not popular at our party and activists, who actually go outside and pick us up.
Please turn back your plan and start listening."
In a sharp turn to Mistress May, she added, "The Prime Ministers will stay on the stand when they make their promises."
Mr. Faraj said that politicians need to "reach the discomfort" when they are going to betray the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It is the question of trust between us – the nations and politicians," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "It won't leave you alone."
In his turn toward the excited crowd he added, "I want you to get rid of those politicians who are willing to betray Brexith, to feel the discomfort.
"We mobilise the people's army of this country, which has given us victory at Brexec, and never calm down until we become an independent, self-ruled, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile the workers of the exit went through Birmingham before holding a two-week rally in the middle of the city.
Several activists waved the Tories Against Brexit banners after starting the group on these weekends.
Lord Adonis's Labour Market crashed over the conservatory with respect to the security issues they faced because of a party's program when opening a conference.
"These are the people who tell us they can have a ready-to-use IT systems and all the technologies for Canada plus, for the no-threat border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's full of farce.
Things like good Brexit don't exist," he added.
Warren plans to pay close attention to the President's position in the runnings.
U.S. Senator Elisabeth Warren says that after the elections in November she will pay close attention to the process of running for the presidency.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts on Saturday mentioned her future during the common East in western Massachusetts.
Warren, part of the critic President Donald Trump is going to go through the re-election, she's going to oppose a member of the Republican Party, Jeff Dzille, who was the senior company of the Trump company in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was in the middle of a debate as a possible rival to the Trump in 2020.
Since Trump's entry into office, this has been the 36th meeting of voters in the general east that took place Saturday afternoon in Khaliök.
One of the participants asked if she planned to run into the president's office.
Warren replied that it was time for 'a woman to go to Washington to fix the broken government, and for this, a woman should stand at the head.'
It did after the death of basketball player Sims from Louisiana University.
The Baton-Rouge police, Louisiana, held on Saturday that a basketball player named Wade Sims was arrested.
Button-Rouge police officials announced the arrest of 20-year-old Ethan Simpson during a press conference that took place at 11 o'clock this morning at Eastern Time.
On Friday, they published a video recording of the shooting, asking for the help of the late man who was painting on it.
20-year-old Sims was shot in the morning on Friday at a campus at South University.
" Wade Sims received a fire-extinguishing head injury as a result of which he died," declared the Chief of Police, Murphy J. Paul, a journalist on Saturday, “247 sports. ”
Wade stood up for a friend and was shot by Simpson.
In the course of the questioning, Simpson confessed that he was in the scene of crime, armed and shot at Wade Sims.
SAMPSON did not resist the arrest and was taken into custody in the police district of East Button Rose.
A sportsman with 6 feet tall, 6 inches (101 cm) grew in Button Rouge, Sims last season played 32 games, of which 10 was on the beach with a start, with an average of 17.4 minutes, and cast 5.6 points and made 2.9 matches per game.
Played in Russia: Lewis Hamilton came up to the title champion of the world after winning the victory over Sebastian Fetele on the inside.
From the moment that Walter Botas had warned at Louis Hamilton's qualifying office on Saturday, it became clear that the internal commands of the Mercedes team played a significant role in the race.
Botas pulled out a good place on the girdle and almost left Hamilton at the liberty of the fate, until he defended his place on the first two beliefs and invited Fethel to attack his friend on the team.
Feet first went down to the pit-stop and left Hamilton floundering at the end of the general mass of gourmets, which was what this manoeuvre was supposed to be decisive.
The Mercedes pilot came up on a pet-stop circle later and came out behind Fettel, but Hamilton stepped forward after a few wheel-in-the-wheel manoeuvres which made the Ferrari driver leave the inner space free, risking to hold on to a double manoeuvre to defend himself on the third turn.
Max Ferstapen started from behind the line of networks on his 21st birthday and was in the seventh place by the end of the first circle.
Then he led the most part of the race till they held the Tyres, for he wanted to quickly finish, embrace Kimi Raekana and take the fourth place.
As a result he went down to the pit stop on the 44th circle, but couldn't increase the speed on the other eight circles, so Rikann took the fourth place.
This was a difficult day, because Walter had all the weekend talks fantastically and had expressed himself as a real gentleman when I would be allowed to say that.
"The team has done an outstanding job to take the first and second place," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Financial for a rally Saturday because she insisted that she did not appear to be the source of Kristina Blacey Ford's letter to accuse the candidate of being the Supreme Court of Brett Cavant of sexual violence.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the evidence, the Ford data before the Senate Court Bureau, instead of commenting that what was happening in the Senate showed how people could be "wrong, repugnant and untrue".
"The only thing that can happen, and what's beautiful is what's happening in the last few days in the Senate, it's when you see anger when you see evil, wary and deceitful people," he said.
'When you read about press releases and leaks, and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do that.
It isn't me."
Remember?
Diana Einstein, is this your run?
Remember her answer... you lost the document "oh, oh, what?
No, no.
From me there was nothing."
Wait a minute.
We took a leak... no, we didn't," he added, advising the Senator.
Feinstein sent a letter in July with a detailed lecture of the charges put forward by the Ford against the Cavanaugh, and he escaped in the beginning of September--but Feinstein denied that the escape had taken place from her office.
"I didn't hide the charges against Dr. Ford; I didn't let her escape," said the Feynstein Bureau, reporting "The Hill."
"She asked that the story be kept confidential and I satisfied her request."
But her refusal probably didn't like the president who so much commented on it during the Saturday rally, "That's what I'm going to tell you, that was a really bad language of the body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but that's the worst language of the body I have ever seen"
Continuing to defend the candidate in the Supreme Court, accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain their power by any means.
You see meanness, dimension, and they don't care who they're dealing with, who they'll have to commit to gain power and control," says the president, "Mediaite."
Elite League: Dandi Stars – Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Duier killed two heirs for the Giants in a match against Dandi
Dandy Stars played for the Friday's defeat that Belfast Giants gave him in the Elite League by winning the 5-3 reverse match in the home game on Saturday.
Thanks to the impact of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bauulee Giants led the two pucks at the beginning.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney compared the number before Duyer renewed the leadership of the Giants.
François Bushard of Dundee compared the number, followed by Lucas Lundwald Nielsen, with two heads, provided the winning team.
This became the third paralysis in the Elite League for the season for the team of Adam Keef, who defeated Dandy with the 2-1 number in Belfast on Friday evening.
The teams met in four times a season; at the previous three matches beat the Giants.
The first goal in the fourth minute of a match (03:35) he killed Duyer from the fall of Kendall McPhol, and in another four minutes Bavier doubled the number after David Rutherford's fall.
In the burgeoning first period (13:10) Sullivan opened the number from the lords of the field, and then the Coon compared the number after the transfer of Matt Markwardt (15:16).
Duyer secured a Giants Leadership at the end of the first break, killing his second cheque at the end of the first period.
When the page was rearranged, Bushar re-levelled the account by killing the checker when the command was numbered (27:37).
Count and Charles Carcoran helped Nielssen bring Dandy to the leader for the first time in the end of the second period, and he won a win together with the fifth number of the team in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have already played four of the last five meetings, will play the last game on the home game against Milton Kanes on Friday.
Airplane perishes, rescuing hundreds of passengers from the earthquake
A statesman in Indonesia lost his heroship, securing a successful flight of a plane with hundreds of passengers aboard.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared without news after the storm earthquake on the island of Suloves on Friday, which called for a tsunami.
Heavy underground jolts continue, and many people buried under rubble in the city of Palu.
While his colleagues were recovering from the escape, 21-year-old Antonius Gunovan Ahung refused to leave his post at the dispatcher's height, which wildly rolled up at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
He remained put until board 6321 of the Batik Air company, which was at that moment on the runway, had burst out of the ground.
Then he sprang out with a dispensary of high when he decided it was to be broken.
Later he died in the hospital.
As reported in the Australian program "ABC News", according to the representative of Air Navigation Indonesia, Jánche Siryta, the dispatcher's decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We had prepared a helicopter from the Balkipapan to the Calimantane, which was to transport him to a more violent hospital in another city.
Unfortunately he died this morning, before the helicopter flew to Paul's.
"Our hearts are broken," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities of the countries are afraid that the number of victims can reach several thousand, while the Agency for the Reduction of Dangers of Stimulative Disasters states that access to the city of Dongala, Sigi and Button is restricted.
A producer of the Sutopo Purva Nugroha agency reported: "Perhaps the number of victims is still increasing, as many bodies have not yet been able to dig from under the wreckage."
The waves that reached six meters devastated Paul, where a massive burial would take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircrafts will double humanitarian aid.
Kusum's lynx, a 35-year-old mother, reported Sky News: "Every minute a car is fast, bringing in wholes.
Clean water isn't enough.
They're making shops everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, reported 'CNN': 'Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help whoever survives, but we don't know what's waiting for them here.
This is already a tragedy, but everything can be much worse."
The president of Indonesia, Jok Widod, arrived in Palo on Sunday, and said to the military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
Is he ready? He's giving us a message.
Earlier this year, in Indonesia, more than 550 people were killed by earthquakes in Lambok.
A plane crash in Micronesia: on the air Niugini message one person dropped without a vest after crashing the plane in the lagoon
The airline that carried out the flight which made the crash landing in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia had previously claimed that all 47 passengers and the team had happily evacuated from the plane which had drowned, and is now claiming to disappear without the news of a single passenger.
The Air Niugini campaign stated in press release that as of Saturday's status she could not report the whereabouts of a male passenger.
The airline reported that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and tracers to find a man.
The airline did not immediately report the details of the passenger; for example, his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the rest of the passengers and the team after landing the plane on a water while attempting to land at the island of Churk.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people got into hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were left in the hospital on Saturday; they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unexplained.
According to the statements made by both the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in a lagoon without moving towards the passport.
By the same letter of some witnesses, the plane leaped off the runway.
According to the American passenger Bill Janes, the plane flew very low.
"That was very good," said Janes.
As he said, he and others were able to get into a belt in the water before the crash pulled out of the plane, which had already drowned.
He said that the boarders panicked and began to shout, as well as that he had got a small injured head.
The U.S. Navy reports that sailors who crafted nearby the marina also helped rescue by using a dreary boat to carry people to shore until the plane sank about 100 feet (30 m).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in a crash of registered aircraft in Papua New Guinea in the last twenty years, but none of them belong to Air Niugini.
An analyst rescinds the course of events in the night when the woman was burned with a life
On Saturday the prosecution concluded a presentation of evidence during a review of the case of a man who was accused of burned by a resident of Mississippi in 2014.
An analyst at the U.S. Justice Ministry, Paul Rowlet, for hours, gave the impressions as an attractive expert in the field of data analysis.
He described it as the jury using notes from mobile phones to recognize the 29-year-old defendant Quinn Tellis and the 19-year-old victim of Jessica Chambers the night she died.
As reported by The Clarion Ledger, Rowlet said he had received information about the place from a few mobile phones which showed that Tellis had been with Chambers in the evening of her death, which contradicted his past statement.
When it turns out that his cell phone was next to Chambers's phone when, according to his confirmation, he was along with his friend Michael Stanford confirmed, the police were on their way to ask Sanford.
Stanford gave the showing on Saturday, and confirmed that the day he was out of town.
When the party of the prosecution asked if Tellis was truthful about what senford had been in that evening in the van, he said he was "shut down, since my van was in Nashville".
Another contradiction was Tellis's argument that he was familiar with Chambers about the two weeks she died.
Mobile phone records showed that they knew each other all week long.
According to Roulette, some time after Chambers Tellis died, he deleted her messages, her names, and his contacts from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hayley.
The side of the defence must start a dispute one Sunday.
According to the judge, it is expected that the case will be handed over to the jury later on that same day.
The High Breed: What is hippie hop?
Hippo-hop Three intends to defy the negative look on this genre by filling out his music with positive installations.
The High Breed, a group from Burrell, claims that the hip-hop thing has moved away from its source: political statements and passionate questions.
They want to go back to his roots and make again a conscious hip-hop popular.
Artists like Akala and Lowkey came back together as collectives as the Fugees and the Commons, popularism in Great Britain.
More murals?'
A young man from New York falls into court for a "rac" post-district marriage.
A young New Yorker falls into court for a discriminating dismissal after receiving a casually sent message from his mother with a complaint that she 's got one black suit.'
And it turns out, they're distances, compared to points to winning.
In 2016, Lynsey Plaska-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment at the discovery that a new nanny, Giselle Moris, was black-skinned when she arrived on her first working day.
“NOE, AS A COURSE,” wrote Mrs. Plaska-Fluxman in her husband’s message.
However, instead of sending him to her, she twice sent a message to Miss Morris.
As reported by the New York Post, having understood the error, Plaska-Fluxman felt uncomfortable and freed Miss Morris, claiming that the former nanny, who was also an African-American, had been ill-treated and that she was waiting for the Filipino instead.
Miss Morris paid for the day of work and sent home for the Uber.
Moris now falls into court and wants to get compensation for dismissal according to the conditions upon which she was originally hired, although without contract: 350 dollars a day for six months with survival.
"I want to show them that it's not easy to do that," she said, "The Post" on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple denied the accusation of racism, claiming that the dismissal of Morris was a reasonable solution, considering that they could not trust her after insulting her.
'My wife sent her something that shouldn't have been said.
She's not racist.
We are not racist,” reported the “Post” husband, Joel Plaska.
'Would you entrust your children to someone rudely, even casually?'
Send your attention to nothing?
Is that right?»
He's flatly likened the bars to "sex" and reports that his wife gave birth to her husband just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
"And you will persecute a man in such a position?
It's pretty hard," added an investment-banking specialist.
While judicial deliberation is still ongoing, the social opinion soon condemned the marriage couple in social networks, raising strong criticisms of their behaviour and logic.
Vodington's publishers were warned that readers would not be allowed to enjoy the bears they were talking about in a new letter
Bonda Karen Yankel's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, wrote about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in a place where someone reads it first before it's published.
It is so interesting to read, already knowing about the great success of Subington."
She said that her father, who had worked for the BBC before he had the intention of writing a book for children about a little cotton bear, was optimistic in spite of the fact that his work had not been received and added that 60 years of publishing the books were "a bitter-sweet" after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of his final success in speaking of Subington, whom she described as "the most important member of our family".
"He was a pretty quiet man, and quite not bragging," she said.
'But since Sublington was so real to him, it was almost a parent's honour for the child who had done something: you're proud of him, though in fact it isn't your fault.
I think that he was considering subtington's success precisely in such a key.
While this was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always paid proper attention to Subington himself."
My daughter died and I had to hang out with her on the phone.
After planting her daughter had been delivered to Nice Louis Pasteur's Hospital 2, where the doctors fought vainly for her life.
"Over regularly called to tell you that it's really bad that it can't bear," said Mrs. Eden-Laperuza.
'Then I got a call over to say that she would die in the next two minutes, and I had to say good-bye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Dad, I love you so much, honey.
I'll soon be with you.
I'll be with you.
Light, which doctors gave to fight her heart, slowly left her body.
She died a little while ago, and this was the end.
I just happened to sit there, knowing that it was all unfolding there.
And I couldn't groan or scream or cry, because around me there were families and people.
I should have stayed."
Finally, Mistress Edenn-Laperus, who was experiencing the loss of her daughter, sat on a plane with the other passengers--and they did not know at all what she had to go through.
"No one knew," she said.
'I bowed my head and my face all the time flowed tears.
It's hard to explain, but it was in flight that I was gripped with Ned's sense of compassion.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how he liked her."
Women who are saddened to hang cards to prevent suicide at a bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones who have died are making sure that no one else takes their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys hang out cards with warm words and phone numbers where people can get help, at a Welsh bridge.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began depressing, and when he was 18, he died of suicide.
"I don't want other parents to feel as I do," she said.
45-year-old lady Davis, who lives in Linden, said that her son was a gifted boss with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew his smile.
People used to say that his smile would light up any room."
But before death he gave up his job, for it was "in a very dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, 11, found his brother's body when he was killed.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm constantly worried about the consequences that this might have."
Mrs. Davis has created cards, "as people know, there are some persons in the world you can address and talk to, even when this friend is around.
Don't stay in silence – you have to talk."
Mrs. Hasfreys, who for many years is a friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her partner, with whom she was 15 years old, soon after his mother died.
"He didn't say that he was sad, or that he was in depression, or anything like that," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
On his secular day he was very oppressed: when the children opened their presents, he did not even look at them."
She said that his death was for them a great trauma, but had to live with it: 'The family had a huge hole.
It's just killing us.
But I have to go on living and fight."

The future of Breta Kavano is uncertain, because the FBI is launching an investigation.
"I thought we might have what he wants to be limited in time and in the scope of the investigation--we can get a bit of a connection," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the Committee was "dissolved" because of what actually happened in traffic.
Why would Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
They're eager to explain themselves sometimes.
Intermediate elections are only five weeks later, on November 6th – if the Republicans are expected to be injured, then they will be weakened in their efforts to select the candidate they want at the top of the court.
George Bush called himself a senator to parliamentaryize Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked at the White House during Bush's presidency, and made himself known to his wife Ashley, who then worked as his own personal secretary, Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are now sitting.
It is not clear yet whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get 50 votes during the Senate's vote that will allow the Vice-President, Mike Penz, to resolve the problem of equality and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
Number of crosses with North Korea crashed in Kim's direction
The number of Southern Koreans who ran from North Korea fell since Kim Chenn came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean official.
Park Bo Sun, bringing data to the Ministry of South Korea after the merger, said that last year there were 1,127 refugees, and in 2011 there were 2706.
Mr. Park said that the main reason for this is because we have strong border controls between North Korea and China and the higher costs of transporting contrabands.
The Pentagon didn't announce it.
Most of the winners get north-east why they get civilisation in South Korea.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, with which in North Korea the longest boundary is going to be, and it's actually more simply going through the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between two areas which are very heavily protected.
China views the fugitives as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often coerces them.
The relationship between North and South -- which is technically still in the state of war -- has improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks about denuclearization.
It happened after a historic meeting between the U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Yin in June in Singapore, when they agreed to work together with the aim of completely releasing the Korean peninsula from the nuclear weapon.
But on Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Mr. R. J. Ho, blamed the American sanctions in the absence of progress since.
"Without confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions we are not going to disarm first," said Mr. Ree in a speech at the AAN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosy called Brett Cavanaugh a "gather," she says he shouldn't work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives of Nancy Pelosy called the candidate in the Supreme Court of Bretta Cavanaugh's "isterial" and stated that by his temper he was not fit for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelos said this during an interview Saturday at a Texas Tribune edition in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't get rid of the idea that if a woman had behaved that way, she'd be called a "bitch," Pelosy said about his reaction to the Kavano speech before the Senate Law Department on Thursday.
Kavano is an emotional overlay of sexual harassment against Christine Blaze Ford, while they were still teenagers.
During his opening speech the Cavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even shouting and could not speak when discussing his family and senior classes of school.
He also explicitly accused Democrats in the Bureau of blaming him of "gratical and organised murders of individuals", organised by liberals, who were angry that Hilary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosie claimed to believe that Cavanaugh's speech showed that he couldn't work in the Supreme Court, because he had clearly shown that he was prejudiced against Democrats.
"I believe he has disqualified himself with his statements and in what manner he has talked about Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
The pelosi denied it when they asked her if she would try the Kavano impal when they picked it out and when the Democrats would get most of it in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this--if he doesn't speak the truth in Congress or the FBI, then he doesn't just have to work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now," said Pelosy.
At this point, Kavano is the judge of the District Court of Appeal of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a member of the Democratic Party of her party, Kavano's potential solutions were disturbing against the law on available medicine or in Row v. Wade's case, because Kavano is considered a conservative judge.
At the confirmation hearing, Cavanaugh did not answer any questions, or else he would cancel certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for sterical, inactive persons to work in court and to wait for us to say "how wonderful it is," said Pelosy.
And a woman should know it.
It is an excused indictment speech, months and years of rage have just been recalculated, and she can't remember it without tears.
"We're crying when we're angry," 45 years ago, Mrs. Stein told me.
"I don't think it's so rare."
She went on, "I was very assisted by a woman who worked somewhere with a director, and who said that when she got angry she cried out but she did the technical behavior, and when she got angry and started crying, she said to her secretary, "Perhaps you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I am angry."
And she just kept talking.
I believe it was great."
The tears are allowed in part like the way out of the sadness because they're absolutely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of the first work on which I once cried out with unspeakable malice; then a elderly woman -- a restrained primary officer, who always scared me a little -- and dragged me to the stairwell.
"Never allow you to be seen in tears," she said.
'They don't know you're angry.
They think thee is sad and will be glad That lead thee."
Patricia Schroeder, while a congressman democrat from Colorado, was working with Gary Hart in the Presidential company.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt got into a marital betrayal on a boat called Monkey Business and got out of the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder said that she could participate in the presidency herself.
'That wasn't a very well thought out decision,' she said to me 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates already, and they didn't need me at all.
Someone called this a "White and Seven Dwarves" situation.
Since the company had gone on quite a long time, she didn't have enough money, so she said she wouldn't be taking part in the elections if she didn't kill two million dollars.
It was a lost situation.
Turns out some of her supporters, who had sacrificed $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
'Do they think I'm going with the tread?' she thought.
When she spoke with the application that she would not participate in the campaign, she was so gripped with emotions -- thanks to the people who supported her, the rage on the system that made it so hard to get money and be directed at voters, not on candidates, and the anger of sexism -- that she was so overwhelmed by her breathing.
'You might think I've had a nervous breakdown,' recalled Mrs. Shroder reacting the press to her condition.
"You might have thought that my corporate sponsor was a Kleenex paper producer.
And I used to think, "They're going to write on my tombstone?"
"She cried?"
Why trade war between China and the United States could be good for Beijing
The first blinds of trade between China and the United States were deafening, and as war is far from complete, in a far more distant perspective of misunderstandings between countries can be of benefit to Beijing, experts say.
President Donald Trump shot the first warning at the beginning of this year, placing China's main export goods' tax on solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place that week, when the new fares covered a total of 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds) in total, effectively taxing half of China's U.S. goods.
Every time Beijing answered in this way, he raised five to ten percent of America's GDP of $60 billion in tariffs recently.
Chinese pianists The United States is a symmetric response, and the second is really an economic response. It's unlikely that the United States will lead.
To force Washington to retreat, you have to deepen your demand, but a public inclination towards the US is practically unacceptable to Chinese leader CJingpin.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes the proper use of the situation, the pressure of the U.S. trade war in the long run can support China by reducing the interdependence of these two countries.
"The fact that a rapid political solution in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will begin a sudden economic downturn is far more dangerous than observers had thought before," said Ezekiel Grace, a researcher specializing in Asia, in a research centre of new American security.
Syrian 'got 'to return the refugees,' said the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria states that it is ready to return the refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding a war-torn country that has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the General Assembly, AAN Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid Al-Mualem, stated that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is more stable and secure, thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to reopen areas that are destroyed by terrorists to get back to normal life.
Now we have all the conditions to bring refugees back to the country that they have been forced to leave because of the terror and economic measures directed at improving their daily lives and means of living.
ANA believes that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are six million more people in the country who are looking for humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would gladly help rebuild an unbroken country.
He stressed, however, that the country would not take assistance in exchanging conditions or assistance from countries that panicked the rebels.
Europe wins at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Raidar Cup, winning the US team with a final number of 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National field in the garrison of Paris, France.
The US has already played its sixth time in a European country and has not won a Rydar cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe still got the crown when Captain Thomas Bjorn's team won 14.5 points in order to win the U.S.
American star Phil Michelson, who mostly fought for tournaments, drove his ball into the water on the 3rd of the 16th pair, yielding this match to Francesco Malinari.
The Italian golfer Malinirs had been great at all rounds by making one of the four players who had passed this field with the number 5-0-0 from the start of the present 1979 format.
An American named Jordan Schpeis was beaten with a number of 5 and 4 players with the lowest rating in the European team, Thornburn Olsen of Denmark.
The world's most violent player, Dustin Johnson, played 2 and 1 Ian Polter of England, who might have played in his last pack of Ryder.
Raider's eighth cup Veteran Spanish Cerchia Garcia made himself a player, who has more than all won a career tournament with 25.5 points.
"I don't normally cry, but today I can't hold back.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas, who chose me and believed in me.
I am so glad to return the cube.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said Garcia, shaken after winning the European team.
He was handing over his brother-in-law to John Ram, who played the legend of the American golfer Tiger Woods on Sunday at a single game of 2&1.
"I'm very proud that I've won Tiger Woods, a man whose career as a kid," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all his four mothers in France and now has a record number of 13-21-3 to the Ryder cup.
A bizarre statistic of one of the biggest players of all time, who won 14 major titles and staggers on this score only from Jake Nicholas.
The American team struggled with themselves for the exclusion of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tini Finns, who played during the entire tournament of fine golf.
American Captain Jim Fury said, after a frustrating game in defense of his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they're fighters.
This morning we sometimes showed Europe what we could do.
We fought.
Let's take the hat off in the honour of Thomas.
He is the great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
So we're going to regroup, so I'm going to work with the American Golf Association and the Ryder Cub, and we're going to move on.
I love these 12 guys and I pride myself on being their captain.
Take a picture before they have a hat.
We've been played.'
