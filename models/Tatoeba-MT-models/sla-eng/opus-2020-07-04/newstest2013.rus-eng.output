Obama's Republican Resistance Strategy to Re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies with the need to combat election fraud.
However, at the Brennan Centre, the latter is regarded as a myth, arguing that cases of fraud in the United States elections are rarer than deaths from lightning strikes.
Moreover, only 300 cases of electoral falsification in the United States were counted by the Republican lawyers in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on the voter appearance.
In that sense, such actions partially discredit the American democracy system.
Unlike Canada, the US is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments have enacted laws since 2009 that complicate the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon has gained new momentum since the November 2010 elections, which brought 675 new seats to the republicans in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were adopted in only one year, limiting the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require the elector to present a photo ID and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the voting period, abolish the voter registration on the day of will and withdraw the right to vote from citizens who have jurisdiction.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state had obliged voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana became the first state to impose such a claim.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indian law in 2008.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend the practice to other states as well.
Over the past two years, they have initiated laws requiring voters to present photo IDs in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have such a universal identity card.
Indeed, 11 per cent of American citizens, that is, 21 million people who have reached the age required to vote, do not have the identity with the photograph issued by the government body of their state.
In addition, five million new voters do not have such a document in 2012.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identity card is often higher than $100.
New restrictions affect disproportionately young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required photo ID.
But that's not all.
The electorate students who are deemed to vote for candidates from Democrats in several states are not allowed to use a photo ID issued by their educational institution.
However, the same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mainly for Republicans, to use the certificates issued by these clubs for voting.
Until 2004, no state required proof of American citizenship to vote.
This was the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have enacted laws requiring voters to prove that they are US citizens.
These measures are apparently aimed at limiting the voting of Latin American voters.
Two thirds of Latin American voters are believed to vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators initiated laws in 2011 that abolished voter registration on voter day in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wish to register.
This restriction did not go unanswered.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped put some 10 million citizens on the list.
However, the measures taken since 2009 have led to a fall of 17 per cent in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have enacted laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period of early balloting.
For example, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the early voters were African-American, although the latter were only 13 per cent of the total number of state voters.
The same was true of Latin Americans.
Only 11 per cent of the voters were 24 per cent of the citizens who voted in advance.
Unlike the whites, which represented 76 per cent of the voters, only 46 per cent of the votes cast in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters strongly oppose the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several draft laws were promised by democratic governors.
The most controversial laws were suspended in the intervention of the United States Attorney General.
This has partially limited the negative effects.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states passed laws requiring a photo identification.
Nevertheless, the new rules that came into force would certainly be hampering the exercise of the electoral right in the 2012 elections.
Critics from Democrats condemn the biases of laws that have been adopted, as seen in them, a clear focus on impacting the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
The 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the election panel to win the presidential election.
It is too early to state with confidence that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
There is only one thing: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the voter appearance.
In that sense, such actions partially discredit the American democracy system.
Screening of oesophagus cancer: going through a test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes gives false, false, and sometimes false, positive results that result in worthless medical intervention.
Men, who are so reluctant to be dissident, have much more to doubt.
Pass the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
Studies in the United States have seen numerous cases of contamination among the study groups, and the data are difficult to interpret and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found different mortality rates for those patients who had been screening and for those who had not.
This study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the probability of metastases occurring 30 to 40 per cent higher in those who did not go through screening.
Therefore, I would recommend a 50-year-old or 40-year-old test if a direct relative had prostate cancer.
Men of African descent are also at increased risk.
A key point is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and virulent.
The patient needs to explain the risk of his cancer by offering him options, without mandatory treatment for prostate cancer, which does not pose a risk to life in the long term, and by choosing, in these cases, to actively monitor the disease.
To date, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to life.
We're going to offer them active surveillance, and if the disease starts to progress, we're going to start treatment.
Increasingly, we are setting out with accuracy the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
So I'd recommend that you pass the test anyway.
But it is also important that you consult your doctor to determine whether you need to or not to undergo the test.
In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Movber has established a tool to assess all for and against passing the test on the PA.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no prescription miracle to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, healthy living remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that 30 per cent of cancer cases could be prevented if all people were well fed and sufficiently moved.
“If no one smoked anymore, this figure would have increased to at least 50%”, emphasized André Bolier, Spokesman of the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10 per cent of cancer cases are caused by inheritance.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Association, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the reduction in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of cases of lung cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes tremendous harm to people’s health.
“Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” says Secretary-General André Bolier.
It is encouraging that 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Wes
According to the CAR, excess weight and obesity also contribute to the occurrence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, thick and straight intestines, food, stomach and uterus.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects the cancer from thick intestines”, added to the Association.
Nutrition
The Association also recommends that the consumption of red meat be restricted.
In too many cases, it increases the risk of colon cancer.
Sausage products should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by buttoning, drying or salinity may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter may harm the cells of the body and lead to cancer development," explained the Association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have studied the impact of vitamin supplements on cancer development.
But so far, the results of these studies are not clear.
According to SCCC, vitamin E studies produced contradictory results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other was the opposite.
The impact on the development of vitamin D cancer is also unclear.
However, Mr. Boljoe stressed that it was important to discuss his concerns and family history with a doctor.
"The analysis does not lead to cancer."
Bozon Higgs in detail
Last summer, it was reported that scientists may have discovered Higgs boson, and it was a real struggle — and not without reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all particles in the universe, not much.
In addition, it is the last particle that has been predicted in the Standard Model - our best, or, in any case, the least imperfect description of the nature and behavior of the matter - which has not previously been found to be an experienced way.
But physics is not yet fully convinced that it is Higgs boson.
We know, without a shadow of doubt, that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it is very much resembling Higgs boson, predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented at a major physical congress in Kyoto this week seem to confirm this, although some data are not yet available for full confidence.
So let's imagine what this is about Higgs boson, because the chances of error seem to be minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is one law in this world that is absolutely inevitable, saying that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to circumvent this rule, not even to try too hard, or to harm yourself.
But although particle physics is quite a strange world, it turns out that there is also one law of this nature: the principle of the exclusion of Pauly, which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same quantum state, that is, in some general terms, in some of their characteristics.
The physics therefore divides the particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens called farmers who wisely obey Paulie’s principle.
In another, there are bosons, a hideous gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything, at least for this principle, which means that they can be calmly in the same place at the same time.
According to the site (an absolutely unusual) Particle Adventure of Berkeley Laboratory, these bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons that we will not talk about here, and the “parts of power” through which the main forces of nature are distributed and to which the Higgs boson refers in some way.
These very bosons should be emphasized, not all exotic beings as you might think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it's thanks to one incredibly banal boson: photon, or light particle, which is a "smoker" of electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes the direction, it “breaks” the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a stone thrown into a powder.
From this “infractions” is produced by an electromagnetic wave (world, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is no different than a photon - and therefore one of the "power-transmitters" bosons.
A more stable field
The same thing happens to Higgs boson, with only the difference that, in order for this boson to appear, it has to be "broken" another field, the Higgs field.
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable in the electromagnetic field; it requires very, very high energy, as if it were a frozen pond whose surface could only be shaken by a very large stone.
That is why a huge particle accelerator is needed, such as the one used in CERNA, the Great Hadron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 km! - to achieve such enormous energy.
Electromagnetic field analogy is also useful for explaining the relationship between Higgs boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never stand alone in the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who interact have mass, while others (like photons, by the way) do not.
So, what can they "bring" all this research, Mrs. Plamondon asks?
In science they are used to verify the correctness of the Standard Model (SD), which also allows physicists to see the difference between the results of observations and the projections of the SM.
In addition, some of them are eager to see such a discrepancy, i.e. the slightest discrepancy can open the door to "new physics" and shut some Modelholes.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant flaws, not offering any explanation for gravity (o!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80 per cent of the universe (oh!).
But until CERN found such differences.
Implications
It would be a mistake to suggest that the average person’s daily life would be more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that he was not.
See, in the early 1960s, pioneers of laser research in Bella's laboratories could not even guess what revolution their work would be.
They predicted their applications in science, but not again.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the Bell Labs, where a laser was invented in 1960, who himself developed the first continuous laser (preliminary) in 1962, said that the original laser was viewed as a "laboratory boyfriend".
Imagine...
In addition, the annex may be found for a toolkit accompanying the study.
For example, the same Williard Boyle developed a light sensor in 1969 during his optical studies.
This sensor, although not originally intended for it, now serves as a “eye” for all the world's digital cameras and earned the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This does not mean, of course, that the work of the Great Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it just shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative aid is the best way to die.
The Commission for Decent Death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
Debates have to resume soon and a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this crucial area.
Long tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in Monterrey.
Prostate cancer that destroyed him from inside gave him a two-year delay.
"I was given five years, I lived seven," he said, between life and death, lying in bed in the shelter of Victor Gadbua's palliative care in Beloya, where he arrived on the eve of the day.
"But it is always a shock, it cannot be prepared," he said.
The disease is doing its job: an amazing weakness that prevents you from going to the bathroom or even eating on your own.
Sitting at the table where the dinner is served, he gives up and agrees to help him take his food.
He wakes up, even tries to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicine, take him to the bathroom.
Courage before ordinary death.
"My greatest desire to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this disease.
"For life, we are taught that a man should urinate," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor Gadbua's shelter.
Regress to the condition of the child - for some unbearable humiliation.
"It all depends on the ability of the human to accept the fall," he says.
Because many people think that important events are occurring in the heart of this decline.
Patients who enter Victor Gadbua's palliative shelter are all suffering from cancer.
Forecasts give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses no longer provides the assistance called “medicine”.
Ms. A., 89 years old, is most afraid of dying "in the consciousness of the suffocation".
But the illness allowed me to know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't want anything more in my life," she says, before I let her put on a breathing mask.
She remains waiting for the next few days for her son to visit from Italy.
Victor-Gaddbua shelters provide body care and nutrition assistance through a team of volunteers.
This is a palliative care that remains when there's nothing more to be done.
To make death more comfortable.
Quebec has one place in palliative aid for every 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little, considering that sooner or later we're all gonna die.
Life here continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors in the shelter.
Both physical, emotional, and emotional comfort.
To the dying one, we will agree to give the mouthfuls of brandy or Pepsi as he asks.
Diabetes no longer make us control the sugar level.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought a beer to Mr. H., who died last night.
In the morning, his son finished his beer at the dead man's feet.
"We help our loved ones, as well as our patients," says Natalie Savar, director of care for the sick.
Victor Gadbua's shelter doesn't look like the other day.
Near a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, resting on his pillows during his toast, tragically dies a young man 36 years of age surrounded by parents, wife and two little children and tried everything to survive.
"In the last six months, from three to five beds, always occupied with cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of the patients admitted to Victor Gadbua shelter arrived from the house and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
77 per cent of Canadians are believed to simply have no access to palliative care, which is provided to alleviate the suffering of the sick, who have entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in the hospital or in the shelter.
And some institutions, such as Victor Gadbua and the Society for Palliative Care in the House of Great Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is this great gap in Quebec ' s health system that has caused many doctors - professionals in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law that legalizes euthanasia and aids in suicide.
Beginning in October, a manifesto signed by palliative care luminaires, Dr. Balfur Mount and Dr. Bernard Ljapuant has been circulating and testifying to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, - she says, - I saw a patient who spent 14 days in an ambulance, in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to relieve them.
I'm afraid patients just want to die because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists have been trying to save patients until the last day despite pessimistic forecasts.
The hope of survival, Ellen Richard, was already minimal when she stopped debilitating chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologue that I was quitting treatment, she said she said she was sorry that I was stopping the fight, she said.
And she told me herself that my days were reckoned!
No comprehensive care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 percent of the patients who are asking for death will be assisted by the medical staff for failing to comply with their request after the palliative care team relieves their pain.
It should be noted, however, that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care in the Society of Palliative Care in the House of Great Montreal, patients are not susceptible to pain in 8 percent of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, where the patient sleeps until his death, either from time to time or constantly.
We cannot pretend any more that we do not know about these sufferings.
More and more patients who cannot alleviate the pain will be able to have access to palliative sedation.
Those who suffer from pain always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want to have a euthanasia," which means "I want it to be easier for me."
The creation of this report was made possible through a journalistic grant from the Institute for Health Research of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, fund collectors of political parties and experts in the Italian Mafia day after day tell us what they know about the vast “system” of the construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unions and mafias.
The industry, which was very expensive, went to Quebec taxpayers, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how this system breaks down after all the funds have been made, is a joke to Jacques Ducheno, a deputy and former Chief of Police of Montreal."
It was because of him that in 2011 the scandal broke out as a by-product of the investigation into official crimes related to road construction contracts in Quebec, which the Prime Minister of the time from the liberals, Jean Sharé, had agreed to very reluctantly.
The Dusheno report established a direct link between industry, the secret financing of political parties and corruption.
“From the start of the investigation in 2010, he stresses that only the Ministry of Transport would keep billions of dollars in contracts” if some were to restrain their instincts from taking a share.
The Charbonno Commission “has already placed two mayors”, he adds, hoping that it will “open the schemes behind the individuals”.
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, consisted of an extensive state of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the officers of the special unit Molot, who, after 2009, forced Montreal 's 100 per cent cartel, to cease to overstate the cost of contracts.
A series of searches have been carried out over the past weeks, and some municipal officials, in particular Frank Zampino and Richard Markotto, the mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
In turn, Gille Vayankur, recently retired from Mayor Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of having multiple bribes in the placement of government orders.
In addition, several engineers of the Montreal Service and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Akkuto and Lino Zambito, were formally charged.
The latter blew up the actual bomb by investigating the “system” of obtaining public contracts.
For several years, Zambito spent 3 per cent of the value of contracts concluded in Montreal to a mob broker who, in turn, transferred the money to Mayor Gerald Tramble's "United Montreal" party.
Zambito spent more than $88,000 (about €68,000) on the right and left in the 2000s, mainly to the liberals who were then in power.
He also admitted that he had illegally collected funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister from the Liberal Party, Natalie Normando.
Sanitation contracts overstated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked unconditionally.
Gill Surprenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail to the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes totalling $736,000 in exchange for the sewer contracts he had exceeded.
Other road construction officials recognized that they had received a 30-40 per cent overcount using false supplements.
Then one of the mayor ' s organizers, Martan Dumont, accused Mr. Tramble of deliberately closing his eyes on the parallel budget, filling the party ' s cash registers with dirty money.
Following those revelations, Mr. Tramble resigned early in November by putting Montreal in a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first MPs in Montreal to be alarmed.
The Mayor of the Riviera de Perry District in the east of the island, has opposed the sale of a municipal site purchased for $5 million and resold for... 1.6 million to builders in the midst of a construction boom.
70 per cent of dirty money in election campaigns
She said that in an investigation that would eventually begin, she would “touch for a thread that would allow her to understand the functioning of a system that would suffocate the ants to stop the gangrene and identify the perpetrators”.
This process is described as “sick but positive”.
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigation team and observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
The way we're going home.
Regularly.
Jacques Ducheno notes, for his part, that “the agents stole hundreds of millions of dollars,” but he is particularly concerned about the role of “election officials who knew about the scheme” but who did not participate in the manipulations.
Given that the share of dirty money in financing the electoral campaign in Quebec reached 70 per cent, he joked: “I was told that it was just a pale reflection of the reality”.
The Government of Québec proposes to limit up to $100 to the parties, but he said it would not change the situation: “until we strictly limit the election costs, there will be dirty money in politics.”
It requires a complete restructuring of the public contract system and the financing of the parties: “We cannot go down; we will be able to build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and legitimacy.”
If this story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Ducheno urges those who laugh to look into their own backyard ...
"PJ - not FK Barcelona!"
In this season, you reached an unusual scale at the PSC.
How do you explain this growth?
This may be due to individual consciousness, but it may also be due to a new dimension of SWAps.
Great players have arrived.
I grow up next to them every day.
Technical staff have also contributed a great deal.
These factors make me raise my game level every day.
And during the match, it's easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I don't.
From the very beginning, at the preliminary training centre at the NIF in Clerfonten and before my arrival in St. Etienne, I have always moved forward.
So you're benefiting from the competition that Carlo Ancheotti has established...
This summer's fill-up is not a very high-level match to play on the news.
They also know that each exercise is very important.
This leads to a game like me wanting to be on the level and to be on top of it.
In addition, Carlo Ancheotti supports my position.
He's being helped by substitutes like Claude Macella, who played in the same position as me.
Angelotti's in charge?
Of course.
Engelotti respects all technical personnel.
Today, he is not equal in the First League, and he is among the best trainers in Europe.
He's had a lot of experience, and he's won a lot of high-class club titles.
He worked with big players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
I had an encouraging conversation with him in January.
Then I walked away from a whole series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PSW season?
In the First League, Leon took the lead in our place.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we were effectively qualified in one eighth of the finals.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We'll try to get as far away as possible.
It's possible now.
We can say our word face to face with very good European teams.
First, we want to finish the first in our group, before Porto, to be able to accept the return match in one-eighth final.
Can the CWW become the first European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for that...
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and fast forward positions.
It's not like that today.
It has the means to make this project real.
Don't take the title in the First League, like last season, will be a major failure?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really want to get this championship title.
Last season, we were close to it.
In May, there was disappointment because we had everything to get to the finish first.
It was a very good season.
We finished it with 79 points.
Usually, 79 points are meant to be called champions.
But another team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Despite the fact that strong teams such as Marcel, Leon, and Bordeaux have joined the title fight, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media expect too much from the PRJ?
It's normal for us to expect a lot from each other, given how much has been invested and what kind of players we have.
We're totally ready for this.
On the other hand, when we're home-winning 4-0 against Truys, and we're still finding a way to criticize, of course, it's a little frustrating.
We ask ourselves what people expect of us in the first place.
We'll never be able to win every 4-0 weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to implement a game design.
The team is formed over time.
We have proven in the Champions League that we can meet the challenges we face today.
Look at Manchester United, who has been unable to get through two seasons in one eighth of the finals, although they have also spent a lot of money!
Given the amounts we invested, we represented you 15 points in advance before the winter break.
That would be a disdain for our opponents and for the French championship.
Leon and Marcel, who were not at the height of last season, were "disturbed" by this new CWW.
This shows how exciting the First League is.
I hope in May we can smile and tell ourselves that despite all the difficulties, we have won.
It seems entirely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovich's feats.
Well, what if they say there's some sort of gold addiction?
This just means that Ibrahimovich is very successful and that he is losing a lot of heads.
He came for it, and he proves he's the star of the First League.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he was a big player and a star on a global scale.
In the group, we respect him as a human being and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did was truly exceptional.
This stimulates others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, who is one of the best advocates in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro-2012 with the collected France?
How disappointing.
I was eager to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my trauma prevented me from wasting a little game time.
I've seen a lot of things there, and I've got stronger out there.
Today I manage to play good team games.
That's what I've been hoping for since I was baptized at the Sinai.
We have learned lessons from what has happened in Ukraine and must now be exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Didius Desham's head?
They're good for him.
He's got good positions in the selection team for the world championship.
He's a tough coach, he's close to the players, and he inspires victory.
What Laurent Blanc was like.
But I wouldn't like to compare it.
Blan achieved his goal, he qualified us for Euro.
I hope that Didier Desham will lead the Blues to Brazil.
A well-deserved nobody (1-1) who was taken out in Spain on 16 October is a fundamental match?
This match gave us faith in ourselves.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, my career had never had a match like that.
Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The complete opposite of the current cash exchange based on the central banks, numbered transactions between the receiving parties and the commission fees for processing them.
In addition, how often these technologies occur is a clear political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of bank monopolies, is leading to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (the pseudonym), is simultaneously a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros ...) and a protected BitTorrent-type exchange protocol that allows for the exchange of files between participants at the same level.
About 200,000 transactions have already been registered from 15,000 computers online.
Several thousand sites accept battles to make donations or as a means of payment.
A bitcoin course, reaching a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to $2, before returning to about ten dollars today (the courses are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing remarkable compared to the world exchange of real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in this system in its report on the virtual currency published in October.
It describes bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency”, “concerning with the dollar or the euro” and “the usual currency”.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as “credits” used to advance video games that are earned in the game process or that can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
The Social Facebook network has also developed a similar system.
But exchange operations always control and process a central organ.
In Bitcoin, all nodes are simultaneously held by bookkeepers, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between the two users actually takes place between two e-mails.
Only for each new payment can the user choose another address, thereby providing anonymity.
The collection of information relating to this transaction is signed electronically using a dual-key encryption system.
The network may also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it may be possible to check that the bitcoins used in the transaction actually exist in a public book sent over the entire network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this book.
It goes through a mathematical task sent to computers, which, as a temporary central bank, is privileged to add this new line.
This is the hashing phase of the file, i.e. transforming a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
The computer takes a new transaction and adds a number to it before it hash out all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (very zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes easily verify that it is correct.
Transaction thus turns out to be inextricably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for the purpose of cheating, the user wanted to pay twice as much money as in less than ten minutes, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed because they had different electronic signatures.
The computer that solved the problem gets 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, the prize is distributed regularly in half, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of battles in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided into one hundred million, leaving another reserve...
The complexity of the task is also increasing with increased computing capacity.
The network's life has been over the take-off and down.
Bitcoin service sites were attacked and the Bitcoin were stolen from reserves.
“The defect used does not concern the protocol itself”, assures Pierre Nouasa, who recently launched Paymium, a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has that disadvantage.
Large players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress blog, allow them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weitzman Institute in Israel analyzed the book and found that almost 80 percent of the battles were not in circulation.
Giant Sales were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works in Coinabul, who is engaged in converting the battles into gold.
Pierre Nuaza, another author of the currency allowance, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a non-contact payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check transactions, which is cheaper.
The controller better controls his personal data and may thus be anonymous.
The system is simple for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It is enough just to provide an address that can be “photographed and recognized” by the phone, clarifying Pierre Nouasa, assuring that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general trend of revision of hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin is established, it will take some time, but 2013 may be a turning point," he predicts.
In its report, the ECB proposes, by the way, to review the various risks considered to be increased today if the system is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
The French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capare and Suraba).
NATO and the Americans should follow them at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future, not just for us.
We were affected mainly by Afghan peasants whom we considered terrorists.
We ourselves, with 88 soldiers killed, were wounded and maimed.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often of peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case with the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are tolerated, sometimes assisted by the local rebels, but they will be gone as soon as the West behaves more delicately.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the height of the hills planted by the almond trees through French credits, was in order.
The convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles escorted by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
There will be no Taliban attack on Kabul since the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their insurmountable progress from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty, and the country was in fire and blood because of the struggle between different groups.
Their taking control of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid for the gloomyness of these peasants, in which they have surpassed Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved in our day.
Former Mojahedas, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become merchants taking over state lands to sell them under construction to returnees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, using huge American subcontracts.
They are discredited; most of them, by the way, have not even fought themselves.
People, as I heard in the countryside, want a government that's not made of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as those who have been able to do American generosity have left: capital outflows are significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they valued its advantages.
About 65 per cent of the population is under the age of 25; there are now 5 million inhabitants in Kabul, one fifth of the population.
Public schools in cities are filled with both boys and girls.
There is a need to provide jobs for these young people, who will not want to return to the maracobes of old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
All, including armed militants, love mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world and that look everywhere.
There's an army right now.
The authorities that will command her will be considered legitimate?
The old anti-Soviet commanders have already taken steps to rebuild provincial wives who would not be under central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, must be decentralized to a certain extent, according to the Western model, but the United States wanted to turn it into a central State with a strong presidential power, removing the post of Prime Minister since the time of the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, from the 1950s and even earlier, depends on foreign aid.
Industry has not been put on its feet, no dam is functioning, no irrigation system has been repaired.
All are imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruit.
Priority is given to the private initiative.
State control over infrastructure would be necessary in a country devastated by the Thirty Years of War.
Rumor has been made that Afghanistan has huge mineral assets.
This only increased the feeling that Western countries were there only to conquer them.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on the ground, without means of transport to export through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left Mes Aynak media, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers of the province.
It is also essential that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relations in one beautiful day.
The French combat unit's withdrawal ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the maintenance of traditional assistance: a girl ' s face, for boys, a French faculty at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural spheres, support for an archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to “make hearts and minds” and to carry out the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the “military activities” service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, together with a small French community organization, has contributed to numerous public work and activities aimed at restoring agriculture to dozens of mountain villages.
These work, with the intensive involvement of the local labour force, has helped to contain the rebellion: irrigation, wells, drinking water, restoration of forests, fruit trees, soil protection and the increase in the area of ravaged land.
What are we going to keep in mind, spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would help improve the living conditions of the local population, very harsh in these valleys, often more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural work from local communities in the province of Kapis.
In order to rid themselves of the uprisings led by foreign groups, what the farmers wanted, as they told me, is to provide them with little military support that would be well controlled and directly addressed.
Severe generations of the Egyptian Constitution
This is a new risky move by President Mohammed Murcy.
While Egypt was divided more than ever, on the issue of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gave it extraordinary authority, he decided to play a wa-bank.
After all, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text for the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State provided the Assembly with two additional months to complete the work.
Soon after two years, Egypt has relied on a preliminary text which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only increased the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his “autocracian misdemeanour” by continuing to “observe the word” and “observe the law”.
In the camp, his followers are confident that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum should be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time that would force the brothers to abandon their intention to explain to the Egyptians the text, the article after the article.
It is also a way for the President to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably, as he said in an interview to the American weekly Time.
In particular, the call for an accelerated vote comes to the Egyptian people's ultimatum: “Whether you vote for my text or I leave extraordinary authority” which is expected to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted in favour of the text yesterday.
Most liberals have not responded to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they clung to the door, feeling unable to deliver their opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, as spare participants, were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that in most cases the articles have been voted unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, slowed down the fact that one of the few differences of the day had arisen around... time for prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the hours of the Constituent Assembly had been wrongly set.
The text on which there was a vote yesterday consists of 234 articles.
The subject of universal attention, article 2 ultimately remained the same article in the 1971 Constitution, which states that “the principles of Shariah are the main source of law”.
Salafist parties, for which the implementation of Islamic law was a basic requirement, hoped to replace “principles” with “rules” that would allow for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is evidence of their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Lecemerie" is the responsibility of the liberals who see it as just a pen.
Because, in their view, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egyptian expert Sophie Pomier, this is alarming, that “people who are called upon to make decisions are not elected or have no democratic legitimacy”.
We can observe the birth of theocracy."
Many liberals are also excited by the fact that the next Rector of this university seems to be far less moderate than the current one.
“There is no specific religious intervention at this time.
With that Constitution, we remain under civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulnas, but people with university education, some have studied in the French system," calms Alexis Bloe, who is preparing a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
However, he acknowledged that “about article 220 there might be ambiguity, since the terms used in it were borrowed from religious vocabulary.
This applies, in particular, to “fix” [Islamic jurisprudence, under the order].
In the future, there may be a question of how competent civil judges are to make decisions.”
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is criticized because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
Muslim brothers claim to have significantly decreased compared to the old regime.
Another controversial point: the authority of the army.
In accordance with the military ' s wishes, the defence budget will be reviewed, not in Parliament, but in the National Defence Council.
There will also be no ban on the trial of civilians in military courts, despite requests from human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text they considered to be harmful to freedom.
Responsibility for blasphemy is maintained and insults are now prohibited, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles speak of the protection of women anymore, emphasizes Heba Moreef, from Human Wrights Watts.
She said that the only positive point was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak on television last night, the demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The party to the Head of State will, in turn, go out on the street on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await holy places, Pup Land, and the sea of salt
The Promised Land combines the grandeur of Bible truths, modern comfort, and the primacy of nature.
The AIF has identified five of the most important reasons why we should be in Israel.
Worshiping the Holy Places
It is worth traveling to the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that all who enter into this “purchaser ” will fall into the grace of God.
And Galileo is the place of Jesus ’ miracles: turning water at a wedding into wine, walking on water, relaxing storms, and filling networks.
Here Jesus appeared before his disciples and after his resurrection.
But most of all, it's a shrine in Jerusalem.
The believers here pass the path of Scorby or Jesus ’ Crossroad (Latin Via Doloroza).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia Pretoria, where there was a court, and on the streets of Old Town, it leads to the Temple of the Lord’s Tomb on Mount Golghoff, the place of Crucifixion, the stone of Anointed One, and the place of the burial of Jesus.
Here, however, is the symbolic Christian Pup of the earth, symbolizing mankind’s salvation.
And the Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was erected in a place where, according to the Christian legend, a tree from which a cross was made to crucify Jesus.
Jerusalem is also the most holy place for the Jews, the Wall of Pac, left of the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different confessions leave notes with desires that are then fulfilled.
Make a Vertical Travel
The ruins of the fortress of Massad remained a secret haven from the enemies, which Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are located on cliffs in the mountains at a height of 450 m above the ocean level.
And only those who are drawn to alpineism can get to them.
The others on this historic top are being transported by the cable lift.
And in the north of the country, at a height of 1600 to 200, there is a famous Hermon mining resort, where in the winter months there is a huge influx of tourists.
He gets a bus shuttle to him from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the mining routes is 45 km.
At the top of the mountain, there were apparently pagan gods.
Visit Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in the country.
You don't come all the way for one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting ones, are worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, not far from Knesset (Parliament).
It contains the ancient Qumran Scrolls, or Dead Sea Scrolls found in the caves of the Judean Desert, and some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It's worth a visit to the Tel Aviv Museum of Arts.
In his exhibition he is widely represented by canvas impressionists and expressionists of Mona, Piszarro, Renouara, Cezanne, Sislea, Matisse, Modiljani, Shagala, Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the Al Basha Ban Museum, which represents several halls of old Turkish baths with visitors and banners of that time.
In Casaria, it is worth going to the unique part of the Rallie Museum, where you can enjoy the sculptures of Dali and Roden.
There's no tour guide or souvenir bench.
Free entry and non-acquisitions are categorically accepted.
Fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Jad-Washem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section, the children's memorial, is built in memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk into it, and you're in absolute darkness.
The stars are dying.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Getting better.
The three main resort areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each has basins, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea, even in the winter months, the temperature of the water does not drop below 21 degrees Fahrenheit [21 ° C] and the air warms up to 23 degrees Fahrenheit [23 ° C].
The Dead Sea is still warmer, and there it bathes for a year.
By the way, this most unusual sea in the world is at the lowest point on the planet, 417 metres below ocean level.
The lake’s water in it is a sundial that can easily hold the sails even if they can’t swim at all.
Landscapes are unreally beautiful.
Here they come to undergo treatment with salt water -- rapes, and kissing dirt, and to cure the health of dermatodes, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar diabetes to bring the nerve to order.
Touching the Secrets of Antiquity
They are preserved by the old part of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through it was the famous Sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
By tradition, Noah built his ark here, and Perseus saved the beauty of Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists are very fond of roaming in small fields named after Zodiac signs.
They say if you stick to the walls on the street of your sign, Fortuna will be favored.
Youths from all over Israel and even other countries can meet in Jaffa for a photo shoot.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, we can roam the Roman theater, take the fortress of the Crusaders.
During the Roman period, Caiaria was the principal city of Judah and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontia Pilate.
A carefully renovated theatre is now being used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourist note
As you go to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: about 30 per cent of the population know Russian.
It is better to take money on a trip, not in euros, but in dollars that are easy to exchange for shekels (now $1 - 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mostly buses, but there is a speed tram in Jerusalem, and Haifa is the only subway in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower Town to the Upper.
It's actually an underground funnel.
There are six shekels in all forms of urban transport, which can be overtaken by transplants for a period of 1.5 hours.
In Israel, Sabbaths are observed according to Jewish tradition.
Since Friday evening, before sundown on Saturday, markets, shops, and public transportation have ceased to work.
On Sunday morning, a week’s work begins.
In many cafes, restaurants, and hotels, only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without garlic and dishes, which combine milk with meat.
It offers a large selection of beef and lamb dishes, soups and desserts prepared for coconut milk, traditional Jewish paste humus, a variety of sauces, pomegranates made from hammered zeros - falalalle, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there's a lot of feeding baskets that are like, "walking by themselves."
In the evening they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Mounds love human places and do not give up.
The rental of the car, depending on the marks, will cost between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance is $15 a day.
And the bike ride will be 15 sheqs a day.
The museum's tickets are 30 shekels on average.
Language of the numbers
In 2012, Israel visited more than three million tourists from around the world.
U.S. citizens, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine arrived most in travel and recreation.
On Earth, from January to October 2012, there were 118,800 Ukrainian tourists, 51 per cent more than the 2010 figure, pending the lifting of visas on 9 February 2011.
"Great and Mighty" will lead to Moscow: migrants dig money into language
While MPs and human rights defenders argue that it will give a law on compulsory language testing, fraud has already emerged in the country that trades “lip” certificates
In Moscow, Petersburg and other cities in Russia, 13 million caterers arrive each year.
Most of these are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support families left behind.
As of 1 December, a law had entered into force that every migrant worker would be obliged to pass a Russian language examination.
As long as this rule is applied only to those who intend to work in the areas of services, housing, household and retail trade.
However, over time, - promised in the FMS - the tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
In doing so, not only the language but also Russian history and the basis of legislation will have to be given.
Knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed for both receipt and extension of the work permit.
An exception shall apply only to nationals of countries where Russian is a State language.
The law does not apply to persons who were successful in obtaining certificates and diplomas of education prior to the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefit, Dedication and Protection of Rights
The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Puskin Institute of Russian, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the IGO, the SSPGU and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to pass tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres have already been opened in Russia.
The testing initiative was supported by members of the Gosduma and the FMS.
And before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to ask the question many times in the press: What would that really do?
What will change the necessity of speaking both for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all, they respond to the migration service, which will reduce the number of people suffering from “labour slavery”.
Many talk about the protection of the rights of migrant workers now, explains the head of the FMS Mission of Russia in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment system will solve the problems of foreign workers by 90%.
Problems arise from migrants without a profession, education that does not know languages without medical examination.
Without any understanding of the language, Sebelev is certain that the future migrant is doomed to face the unscrupulous people who, by means of assistance, will put him in a tight, narrow bar where he and dozens of his likes will spend months without food or documents, pushing him 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive numerous complaints from our migrants.
“They are promised one in their country, and on arrival they are deceived, taken by passports, not paid the promised salary”, confirms the Chief of Labour Migration Department of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't fight, the tenant!
However, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics who are collecting for their earnings in Russia are admitted not only to not knowing the language of the country they seek but also to write in their own language with difficulty.
Of course, it is not as much their fault as their troubles: few Turks, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford even so much primary education.
Their families don’t even have to feed their children, let alone dress them, dress them, and put them in school.
At the age of adolescence, such children are sent to work at the earliest opportunity.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they'll admit it.
"You feel humiliated and incomplete."
True, with regard to the law on the language of human rights defenders, there is one important point.
The testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no examination or subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, most of the caterers still live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome, or Foreign Entry Free"
Many of the visitors argue that it is not easy to obtain official status in our country.
The reason is in bureaucratic barriers and all the same linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs between 12 and 16,000 roubles.
And here's a fake registration that can be done quickly and in a mere half a thousand.
The Russian police know that we mostly have false documents, no registration, no extortion cases.
"Ask a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea", shared with journalists from Tajikistan's citizen Umed Huskadamov.
"Come on, don't buy it, buy it."
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was found that it was not only migrant registration documents that were false.
Several "lip" language test certificates have already been withdrawn by FMS staff.
Counterfeit papers are printed on a regular colour printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get their way; each of the migrants who hoped to facilitate the examinations had paid 7,000 roubles for the document.
This is twice the cost of official testing: it will cost a migrant working in three thousand.
In that the main task is to protect the system from corruption in the near future, so that “steps” cannot be simply bought, matched by authorities and human rights defenders.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise to pass a first-time test on a basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian visitors will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The IMF does not trade in the illegal arms market
The proportion of legal-weapon-related crimes is very low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to strengthen the law on the holders of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: To fire shots at weddings when there were no casualties, and a fighting by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which killed seven people.
Police want to ban trauma in public places and increase the age from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by Irina Jarovay, head of the Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, and promised that amendments to the Arms Act would be made to Gosdum in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by “rolling hooks”.
There was an open letter on the web, whose authors - representatives of various public shooting organizations - called for a “unreasonable tightening”.
The percentage of record-armed bullying was minimal, according to the Russian Service Bi-bi-si lawyer Vasily Lesnikov.
According to IMF statistics, 142 firearms crimes were committed in the six months of 2012, while 1,168 thousand crimes were reported in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that tightening civil-weapon legislation does not place the offender in the “black” market.
Now, they say, in Moscow, any weapons can be found at a low price.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Internal Affairs asserts that they control the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black arms market is being replenished through several channels.
The main channels are five, says Colonel Victor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and General Staff.
Screening of the site accepting the arms order
The first is an "Armian or military trail", that is, a weapon that was stolen during the Caucasian fighting.
"The weapons were carried by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranets said.
The next type of black weapons is stolen by criminals from the forces.
Baranec explains that this includes both police personnel who were taken from police warehouses and were directly stolen from law enforcement officials.
Illegal guns are being sold from military warehouses.
Many military warehouses often had explosions.
“There are proven versions that part of the torches were made specifically to cover up the lack”, said the former military.
According to Baranz, weapons manufacturers are doing their best.
“At present, private weapons factories are breeding up, which are not competitive in the international market and are throwing weapons out of the fields into the black market, including Moscow,” the expert says.
Another source of black market is smuggling.
Guns and machine guns from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan, are particularly common.
"There is production, sometimes artisanal, and there is a mob that has organized a flow," explains the former military.
Where did the gun come from?
Experts considered the approximate proportion of each source of illicit arms to the “black” market.
The 2011 report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Management Design.
Specialists analysed the reporting of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, criminology and open portals on weapons issues.
The vast majority of illegal weapons are written by researchers, come from the army and the forces.
Half of all the weapons in the black market were found there “on the fault of officials whose work is related to weapons”, the report states.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the cases come from areas of armed conflict, 14 per cent of the cases occur in the arms production stage, and 5 per cent are in the “black archaeology”.
A salesman consulting one of the arms stores, who has asked for his name, assures us that the weapons found by black diggers are too old for a long time.
Most of the time, as he says, for a new party, sellers go to the military warehouse.
Through the flag, a person buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
It's written out, passed through the pay phone.
"He's taking her to town and here he's selling 900 euros apiece with two stores," he says.
“Truly, the police are aware of all cases, so that, on occasion, when a crime detection plan is being set up, a controlling purchase from traffickers of illicit weapons”, the consultant adds.
"How in a luxury store."
The seller and buyer are most likely to find each other through acquaintances.
I've been looking at websites, blogs, and I haven't responded to a friend who's offered to come to the platform of the Gods where there's going to be a man who's taking me to the corner where we're going to trade.
I only learned the price of a gun there.
Military Observer Victor Baranets
To get a gun, I need a friend who has an exit, he's talking to a consultant salesman.
There are sellers on the markets, but there is also a need to come, on condition, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to tell that his daughter's tooth fell out".
I'm getting a couple of cassettes right now because of the man I'm sure of.
He's only giving them to me, too, because he knows I won't give it to him.
Novices look for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Victor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he prepared an article on this.
The schemes, he said, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there was "anything."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," said the military.
The buyer, according to Baranz, doesn't have a cat in a bag, anything can be tried.
I'm a potential client. I'm not just buying. We're going with a salesman to the woods.
"I'm given the opportunity to shoot, and when I'm convinced that weapons are good, we're starting to trade," the expert described the procedure.
Dining shop
Internet search sites and groups are listed in the Vkontakte, where they offer to buy weapons for different purposes.
No documents and personal meetings are required.
"Suffice to have a certain amount of money," they write in an ad on the "Buy a gun or a machine" site.
Users leave their applications and ask questions.
And they'll sell them to minors?
“Without a license,” asks the user “Ivan” (orthography retained).
"Cuppy T.T. Moscow" is a concise formulation of "Fedorenkov"'s request.
The Federal Security Service has now scattered a vast network of ground-based sites and willing to purchase war weapons with a shovel.
People go like hungry fish to feed, and then they get into Siberia.

I've heard of these schemes: usually the site is registered outside the Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer pays through the ATM.
“In response, they send a photograph and a manual where the weapons are hidden”, says the press secretary of the public organization “The Right to Weapons” by Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that by leaving the application on the site, you can remain unarmed and get behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has now scattered a vast network of ground-based sites and willing to purchase war weapons with a shovel.
"People go like hungry fish to feed, and then they get into Siberia's coal," he says.
A $100 Makarov
In the purchase of illegal small arms, experts estimate an amount of $100 to 900.
According to Dmitry Kislova from "Right to Arms", Makarova's gun can be purchased for $100-300.
We'll have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from the warehouses of the long storage management of these medium-level warehouses.
According to official statistics by the agency, the number of such crimes in general fell by 7 per cent for Russia from January to October 2011, and the number of reported thefts and extortions of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
In the U.S., fast food and supermarket workers are battered
Work on the McDonald's cassette takes place up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, the Americas have seen a wave of protests against low wages at Walmart corporations and restaurants of popular fast food networks such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Vandes and Kentucky Ford Cheyenne.
So far no one has to predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth wave, or whether it will die early.
Shares are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to raising the modest wages that ordinary Walmart workers and fast food systems receive, the aim of protestors is to establish trade union organizations.
Until this sector of the economy is almost covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
Stocks began last week, after Thanksgiving, in the so-called "Black Friday", when America was hit by an orgy of cheap sale, which captured millions of people and sometimes accompanied by treasuries.
On this day, some Walmart employees, who work 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and picked up trade unions and left activists from a corporation whose goods are based on people of modest and medium-sized wealth.
Walmart sells to everyone in the world, from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to chickens, eggs, and milk.
Products in his stores ranged from 8 per cent to 27 per cent cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-paid Walmart workers are only self-employed.
The availability and range of products made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the product of the embroidery partly because he pays his employees little.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the shortage of trucks or hand scanners.
The stakes in the Black Friday required an increase in wages and the cost of the health insurance provided by the corporation was raised from $30 to $100 per month.
The typical Walmart worker, who received $9.5 per hour, was told that the expense was not on his pocket.
Scientists at Berkeley University of California prove that if Walmart raises the average salary to $12 billion an hour, it would cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than she's paying now.
If Walmart could translate the increase in salaries into buyers' shoulders, each visit to the store would cost them only 46 cents more.
In a year, they're going to spend about $12.39 more than they are now.
The Walmart supporters say quite well that the protest took place in just nine states and did not cause any minor damage to the corporations.
"Black Friday" continued in her stores from 8 p.m. Thursday to midnight the following day, and at that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
A total of almost 100 million transactions were made on Black Friday.
Dan Fogelman argued in an interview with Huffington Post's left site that the jobs had left a total of “less five” Walmart employees, and that the protest action was a mere “second pear trick” organized by her union.
"Free cash!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where they were not targeted by Walmart (they do not regret it in this progressive city, which is why they are not here yet), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonalds says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn't even give you sick people and pays you for honest work!
Djumaine Williams, New York Hills Member
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
The fast-food restaurants increase over time, but are not uncommon, and on average, their regulars receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one earns less in this expensive city.
The way you can exist in New York for that kind of money, we can't reach it for me.
At one time, almost a quarter of American teenagers went through McDonald's to work on their stalls after school while living with their parents.
Few people have seen or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I'm constantly interviewing McDonald's employees who complain that they have to live on this salary and sometimes even feed children on it.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal Forum has a comment that the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you will feed them on.
The protest participants, who started at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of the fast food system start paying at least $15 an hour, that is, more than doubled their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade union organizations be established in the area of fast food.
The American Law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing the unionist movement by beatings and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But it is also difficult for trade unions to reach fast food for objective reasons.
One of the main is the unusual turnover of staff.
Disagreements
The noise protests took place on this day and at several other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The campaign culminated in a rally at McDonald's in the middle of the day, near Times Square, during which several local democratic politicians spoke, in particular a member of the Jumaine Williams Hills Hill, who said, "Macdonalds," said he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you sick and pays you for an honest job!"
Other prominent New York Democrats, such as the mayor of Bill De Blacio, have been supported by demonstrators, who stated that “we must be friendly in support of fast food workers so that they can achieve the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!”
As the New York Times has described, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the American fast food sector.
But there were only a few hundred people involved, but not all of them were fast-moving workers, in which tens of thousands of people were employed in New York.
It is not clear yet whether this spark will produce a flame of mass movement.
"So far, lying to the brain gets the average."
The theme of modern technology has recently been popular among fans, and it has been accepted mainly through the prism of special points.
At first, during the summer of its annual conference, the existing model showed Google and then in November it became known that Microsoft also applied for the relevant patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of an interactive 3D technology group at the Cambridge laboratory Microsoft Sharam Izadi, it is clear that for the scientists of the company, the points were staged.
They are manipulated by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Can you please tell us what your research team is up to?
- We're interacting with cars, but we're trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, mankind has become stuck in the process of dealing with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes twigs in their fingers.
We would like to look five to ten years ahead and anticipate fundamental changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect, because everyone is interested in rigid control.
- What's ahead?
- Although Kinect has transferred the interaction to a physical level, much still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information input has improved (the system is receiving more data) and the output is not yet very good.
We're trying to change that, we're working on real three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world, make it more obsessive.
In order to do so, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we can complement the reality of the world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
First of all, those stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice control?
A popular thing, but don't they overestimate it?
- It's certainly not a panacea, it's a matter of privacy, because it doesn't always want to tell people about its actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of connections to computers are good, but everyone in their niches.
For example, in order to manage devices in public places, we had a project where we thought about gestures, but not about the masses, but about the aggregates, the short ones.
The gestures were not taken by the camera of the device, but by the hand bracelet that fixed the movements of the bones and muscles.
So far, it's big, but theoretically, it can be reduced to the size of the wristwatch.
But in general, the future is followed by a mixed type of governance, for example, a gesture+vote.
- How's that?
- Like, how do you ask me to hand over this gas bank to you?
You say and show at the same time.
- I usually just say.
- Oh, it'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what the car can or can't right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual bond.
In the near future, I think we're going to have to work mostly on developing new types of sensors that will allow for more accurate determination of human reactions.
These could be laser sensors, for example, they give good resolution at depth, it's very important.
- Speaking of your working with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims to modern cameras?
Is there a lack of permission, depth or anything else?
In principle, the present generation is something that can be alienated from our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to have megapixels of 8 at a speed of 1,000 kps.
But it's not the megapixels, it's the matrix, it's the depth.
From the latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, and this adds to the work of algorithm designers.
So you have to remember not only the X- and Y-axis, but also the Z-axis.
It's also a very important speed, the number of personnel per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 k/s are very small, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes, from our Radmond lab, has made a touch sensor with a controlled delay of 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) meter.
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction of people and machines.
I would be very comfortable in my work with the equivalent of such a device, only without requiring that the staff be more than a second.
- Don't you have to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three "cams", one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the other one is the receiver of the reflected signal.
And now the third camera is actually a normal sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or add to it by increasing the required calculation.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue Kinect, play with the camera's position curve and see how this would help in the three-dimensional definition of the situation.
As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its points to the public.
Don't you think, in terms of everyday use of complementary eye reality technologies, it's one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, all the time, keeping a smartphone in your hands, not very comfortable, but that's what I think: the coolest option would be a "transitional" complementary reality, when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could switch from the eye to the smartphone, the projection display and further everywhere.
Glasses are a very personal device, in which they are powerful (only you see private things), and at the same time weakness - an additional reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to the simple mortal.
There is one problem that is often criticized for such an idea: there is no tactile response!
Hands don't feel a thing!
What are your group's responses to this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that the completed reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could well be the tactile sensational addition.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is using the second hand as a kind of image pad.
She's a great pressure recorder!
But there are technologies that really aim at giving these "cards in the air" tangibles -- for example, the interference of several directed ultrasound rays at a certain point where the finger is located -- gives you a sense, but as long as it's very weak -- it's like they're blowing your pillows.
There are bracelets on the wrists that affect nerve endings in the fingers -- also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to deceive the brain?
Make him think he feels like he's supposed to feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried.
There is another challenge that remains to be faced for a long time - how to force a person in a very limited space to believe that he is going through open, almost endless work and concepts of treadmills (some other than clubs), moving platforms, and huge balls.
As long as the brain is fooled, the average is still working for many years.
That's what makes the virtual reality so attractive to the researcher -- a lot of things that are completely initial.
Sausage instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt is continuing the Peterburg vanguard project on the citizens who are in the front, in the vanguard of culture and art.
This top list has already been reached by the prominent actors of the art scene of St Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, passing over all over the world.
The new character "Rosbalta" is the beautiful artist Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller, a bearded man dressed in all red, the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden, the fashionable people, and the relics.
Cyril Miller's paintings always gather crowds of spectators wherever they go.
Cyril Miller is one of the mere Petersburg socio-philosophers who create new mythologies.
Cyril Miller is a bright man from the Peterburg vanguard in the late '80s, early '90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, with his appearance on the streets smiling at the townspeople, raising all spirits.
He had recently taken up the charm and became a Peterburg charmer, for he had matured into this difficult role all his divine existence, philosophy, and image.
- Cyril, why are you still walking around town in all red, not yellow or red, for example?
- I chose red as a model of appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between artist, immigmeyer and society.
Although in society, anything that is a little bit gray is causing aggression and a bad temper.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to a discussion.
- When did you realize you were supposed to be an artist?
- At an exhibition at the Nevsky DK where my work was exhibited.
I knew this was my way.
At that time, the wave of the old free, informal artists passed, and the new, free-of-the-art, I was incomprehensible.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gason landscape, which led to "Pushkinsky-10", and there was no more wave.
I'm thrown into theater, clothes, music, all genres, except for the word.
- It was important for me to feel at the center of Petersburg culture, where all the best creative forces should be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied the territory of Pushkinsky-10, and there was a music and art club, a godmother club, a house of the Peterburg godme.
Many were born there: NOMs, Tekila Jazz, I remember Snura being brought with the project "Uho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under the fan, they were in a tight T-shirt, among them a modern composer, Igor Vdovin.
When the band played alive, it became Leningrad.
Trahtenberg was leading many programs before the Hali-Galivian times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and we went to his great career, and he received basic education and education from us.
The D 137 Gallery, the Gryboedov Club is a reverberation from the Art Clinic.
That's where our workers and our workers left forever.
I'm the hero of yesterday's century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the interview was in the press, and the prize was "People of Our City".
I was named and my culmination ended.
In modern times, it is not easy to work under the old rules, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
It is easy to become popular in our years, but culture and popularity are shared, and can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is well-acquainted with manners.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they're vividly relevant and sharp.
I'm going to have a program show, "Russia Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are off-the-book.
I've been social before, now being like this is painful and scary.
But in clowns, everything's spoiled. Tragism is gone.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the saving of peace through totalitarian disguises is ordered.
Now they meet on their clothes, focusing on outside mechanics, not on the inner person.
Maybe he can't get his hand out and spit in the pink.
And the deception will be taken away by disguise.
- And recently we saw you as a city charmer.
I don't think they should be.
- Well, could business art be beautiful?
- Commercial art should be neat, tactful, sweet.
There's crop disintegration.
People used to run into rooms, godma loved one thing, a bunch of bad guys.
Now everyone's broken into micro-communities, now everybody's gonna love it.
I'm not a hundred-dollar paper to make everybody like me.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now every cult hero has 100 worshipers.
- And Stassa Mikhailov gets a few thousand!
- He's wearing broochs, and there's a sex-social sphere that works.
And on cultural grounds, 300 people will come, and 10,000 people won't come, and eventually less management, less money, they'll blow it all away.
I have worshipers, most important of all, not to deceive them, not to ruin their lives.
As a young man, I wrote pictures of a collector hanging near Falcon and Larion.
I started with paintings that usually end up with.
Now they're often confused.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another opera.
I am a person of yesterday's culture, raised by the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, abandoned money for painting paintings.
I'm for a culture like that.
- Cyril, what's wrong with Peterburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There's this notion: a cultural official.
But not all of them can do culture.
In the case of the right kings, the kings may not have understood much in culture, but they understood the need to keep the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow right now.
We have people in Petersburg who might be experts, but they are biased, because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and give them the way.
It's delicious.
The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by what they honestly say that not all contemporary art we accept, there are artists who should be looking for other museums.
- What's wrong with you, Peterburg?
- Petersburg is not a cultural capital, there's much more culture in Moscow, there's soil there.
And on our rocks, it's hard to grow.
We need cultural soil, and we have more writers now than readers, it's wrong.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are very curious, who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We've got this layer of thinner.
We need to do fashion art, as it was in the early part of the last century.
Project implemented on the grant of St. Petersburg
Born in Space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or asteroid-killing collision.
Spaceships with earthlings on board are being sent to find a spare planet.
In order to preserve mankind, what is the main question about how to continue in a state of uncertainty or on the same reserve planet?
I think it's a small choice.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be grasped at least hypothetically.
“It is Venus and Mars”, according to the Senior Scientific Officer of the State Astronomical Institute of P.K. Sternberg (GAISH) Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions are more suitable for life on Mars, the surface of Venus is 500 degrees Fahrenheit [500 ° C].
You can only live on high altitudes or Venus' orbit... in space.
Approaching the question of reproduction in outer space began with the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of peas raised in orbit were no different from their earthly varieties.
Then there's insects in orbit, tiny fruit fly dozophiles.
In 1979, eggs were sent to space to check how the embryo develops in a state of uncertainty.
We get a perfectly normal bird on the way out.
And then the problem begins.
“The problem of finding resistance to this bird must be raised on its feet and begin to move”, explains Vladimir Sychev, the lead laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP).
Without the resistance, the birds were in an orderly position to cook.
Ten hours later, newborns had a complete atrophy of instinct.
The birds did not respond to light and sound.
And the trouble was, four days later, they just died.
"And twice we hatched the birds, and then they refused, because it's just impossible to work with them," notes the failure of the experiment with the birds in the cosmos Vladimir Sychev.
The last time he flew with the animals, he was in orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, experiments will continue.
But there will be only one sex on Beyon's biosatellite.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent to space with fruit.
In principle, they found nothing supernatural there.
"It was on biosatellites, but again it is a single experiment, and such research must be carried out," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats had a progeny.
But it is not possible to address the problem of reproduction directly in outer space.
It's not an easy task.
Animals, losing their habitable habitat, simply cannot carry out their sexual instincts.
But a man, unlike beasts, in principle, may.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking and is able to create a suitable emotional background.
There are, for ethical reasons, no such experiments.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova's.
And the most precious thing humanity has is a female organism.
Our Chaika has flown away, and no one on Earth could say if he would stay in space after the flight.
I wonder if she's capable of having a baby after this flight.
"No one answered that question," said the veteran of the missile-space industry, Wahtang Vaczende.
In June 1964, just a year after flying into space, Valentina Tereshkova's first female spaceman had a daughter.
Andrian Nikolayev's child's father was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, Svetlana Savitsko, a second space woman, was born in orbit twice and even working in outer space.
However, the risk remains.
We don't have a lot of cosmonauts, and after long flights, they're all gone, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if there's more, it's dangerous even in the orbital flights," says the rocket astronaut, the Soviet Union hero, the Russian hero Valery Polakov.
Nevertheless, mankind needs to look for new ways in biotechnology, protection from radiation, creation of artificial gravity.
CCC hydrolaboratorium is a mandatory phase of preparation for flight.
Here, in the zero-floating environment, cosmonauts develop their skills in outer space.
Water imitates ignorance.
If adult water is comfortable, but it's a foreign environment, it's a family line for babies.
It's as if the little innitimaires confirm that life on the land is coming out of the ocean.
There's a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months old with the mother in the lavish fluid, and it's easier for him to get used to the vodka.
That's actually logical, because since birth, since that first bath, it's only been two weeks.
"It's very little to forget," says the instructor for the December navigation of Marina Axenov.
In other words, if the child's lack of consciousness is more natural, then women need gravity, strength of gravity.
Very quickly, the muscles of the abdomen, the pelvic muscles, fall into the ability to exhale the fetus.
All right, let's put this down, and let's just rely on birth stimulants.
Of course, in a special cell, she's going to get it out.
"And then what?" asks Valery Polakov's trivial questions.
On the other hand, a child also needs artificial gravity.
Without a sense of earthly attraction, the body will not form a skeleton or a muscle system.
It's impossible for a newborn in orbit, like an adult, to wear a special workout suit.
He'll just be deprived of what he needs.
"And this experiment that you and I are going to go to when we allow a child to be born in a foreign environment will lead us to bring into the Earth a disabled, completely disapted person," predicts bioethic committee director Igor Pestov.
So far, the birth of children in space is a question of theory.
In time, however, this will be a reality when the earth’s surfaces on their ships go to a distant planet that will be home to their descendants born in space.
Chief of the General Audit Office: Auditing of the Swiss system failed on the part of politicians.
In the public procurement sector, Czechia has good monitoring bodies and, despite the existence of good legislation, it lags behind.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kal, Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview for the News.cz website.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack," commented Kala's current situation.
Such conclusions provide joint inspection of the Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of mispractice, Peter Nečacz’s approach to the so-called mooring system is cited.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the GDP (Civil Democratic Party) would not bother entrepreneurs with checks - is this prohibited or permitted?
“The law should be established in any way, and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot stand up to the work of institutions that are required to verify and enforce obligations”, notes Kala.
At a meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you discussed a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which compared the legislation on public procurement of both countries.
What was the point?
It means a parallel check that we started two years ago.
To put it simply, European legislation had established how public procurement should be carried out, national legislation should be followed and then applied in practice.
All the information has been collected and, even with an outstanding check, interesting differences have been found - in other words, we may have “accurate and flawless” legislation, but in the practice of applying we give Germany concessions on some of the parameters.
It follows that it is not enough to establish ever-increasing rules to focus on the application of the law itself.
And just how can this project help you, what does it mean to you?
It is this joint monitoring that can contribute to efforts to stop clarifying laws, reducing and improving restrictions, because this does not lead to a positive outcome.
Economy means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour.
But it's not the fact that we're going to achieve this by reducing the restriction of orders.
Perhaps the system will overflow with “buds” so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system will find them much easier than if the restriction did not fall.
You are referring to internal problems in the practical application of the law on public procurement.
How does the control system function in Germany?
Is there an organization like our CIA or does it work differently?
As far as institutions are concerned, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is based on our principle, also exists a panel that works a little differently, but mostly both institutions operate in a similar manner.
In addition, the powers are somewhat similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, that is, audit units and federal land levels, their system differs slightly from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have government funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the Federal Courts of Accounts.
As far as local law is concerned, is it easier than we do?
In general, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respect Germany can be taken as a sample, but it cannot be said that it is better at all.
Is that because they're better at controlling?
I definitely don't, but I'll say again, I don't like this comparison.
But it must be said that even exemplary countries face many challenges.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any advantage from working with our office, would they?
With regard to domestic legislation, how did the amendment to the Public Procurement Act affect your institution, in what way?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is quite short, it has not yet demonstrated itself in our control work.
Since we are monitoring the facts, some delays need to be taken into account.
We take this into account only in the preparation of future audits - we have started using our new tool to “invente the risk of inestimation of inestimability”, through which we have run nearly 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed them, and of course these changes will occur, because restrictions are changing, some types of tenders are changing, and so on.
Do you believe that the approval of this law will bring benefits or additional burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that's true.
The problem that may arise is that the rules will be “absolute” and cannot be respected.
Under the previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to a supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes - regional council) that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement constitutes a violation of budgetary discipline.
Is this the way to tighten the law?
I don't think that's the way it is.
The system must exclude those who want to capture and abuse but do not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the solution.
Such a system will only put even more pressure on bureaucracy.
And then how do we get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
The Prime Minister recently stated that the GDP would not be concerned about entrepreneurs by checking the so-called "Schwartz system." What does that mean?
"Schwartz system" banned or authorized?
The law should be established in any way, and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot stand up to the work of bodies that are required to verify and enforce obligations.
You could say, "We're going to change this law and we're going to let it go," but we can't say we're going to pretend like nothing's going on.
The Public Procurement Act contains rather strict rules, as it should be formally carried out, and this is correct, which will protect public procurement.
On the other hand, it is tragic when a candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack.
The roads are slippery, but mostly pass.
In some places Czech roads are cold and snowy.
They're mostly passing, but somewhere more cautious.
Karlovac region
This morning, the roads in Karlovy Vary were paved, but some were cold and snowy.
The temperature fell from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day it should be warmer.
The snow had ceased in the region, only in the lowlands had a small layer.
However, on the ridges of the Red Mountains lies about 20 inches [30 cm] of snow.
From the information received from the regional road workers, it was known that places were less visible because of the fog.
The R6 expressway and first-class roads in the region are now unlimited.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface can be drossy and slippery.
All roads in the second and third grades, including the mountain routes, are also covered.
But some of their areas still contain the remains of frozen snow and snow.
Especially careful is needed on the roads on high places.
Pardubice and King's Landing
The management of Czech roads and highways on its websites on the Internet reports that some eastern Czech roads are in danger of becoming holodeck, and on mountain roads and roads on highlands may be a snowline.
District road workers warn drivers about the holodeck, which can occur especially in the highlands of Pardubice.
Gold can be around Lanschkron, Usty nad Orlica, Policki, Switavi or High-Mito especially on second and third-class roads.
The roads I/43 and I/34, located in Svitavi, are treated by chemicals.
In particular, snow lies on the roads of Krkonoše and Orlické Mountains.
The snowline is set on roads on high altitudes in the areas of Rihnova nad Knezhno and Trutnov.
In eastern Czech Republic, today the variable cloud is unscathed.
The temperature usually varies between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, light wind.
Plzenski kraj
The roads in the Plsenland pass this morning, but places need to be cautious and adapt to the weather.
In the morning, the temperature fluctuates from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places, it may be slippery.
Drivers may experience fog by places, but visibility will gradually improve.
Regional road workers provided information.
Shosse D5 is now almost without restriction, but the road managers recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
The southern Pilsen and the Tahoves may have the darkest areas.
The second and third classes are wet, and in this case also there is a warning of the possibility of slippery areas.
Drivers must be cautious, especially on the low-used roads in the Shumawa area.
The Olomouc Land of Olomouc
Drivers heading for the Elevations of the Olomouc Region must take into account the snow on the road today.
It remains after the use of chemicals in the Chervenoir saddle and on the road in the direction of the Videll Krshizh.
During the night, the snowstorm forced road workers into the streets, according to traffic management information, about two inches [3 cm] of snow fell in Shumperka.
In other parts of the edge of the road, there are usually no restrictions.
"There are remains of snow in the high places of the Shumlar.
Drivers headed towards Esenika must be aware of the snowy mess in the Chervenogorsk saddle," CHAN (Czech News Agency) said today.
During the night the roads were cleared, and their colleagues from Esenika assured them that the roads on high ground after the treatment of chemicals remained bare and wet.
In Olomouc, roads are unfettered, but in Sternberk, drivers must be alert at forest sites where humidity still remains.
Ustekka kraj, Liberska kraj
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia report that several difficult places remain.
According to the police database, a mountain road on the Telnice site at Klinice, Usteck County, has been closed in addition to several places with ice cream or snow.
The temperature also remains negative in the lowlands, so there is snow and ice on the roads. In the lowlands, especially south-east of the Czech Republic, there is no problem, the road is mostly dry.
Road complications have not yet been reported.
Road workers report the appearance of a holodeck in the vicinity of Stéti.
According to meteorologists, the ideal conditions for his creation at night were created - rain and snow all day long, and the sky became clear at night and freezes began.
Unfavourable conditions on the main highway and on route I/13 at the border of Ustecki and the Lebanese region are reported.
Because of the snowcapped branches of trees on the road itself, the Telenica road was closed at the Library.
Shimon Ornast: At concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think of less than a month from now?
It's just one of the many disturbing news that we humans are so easily caught in.
Together with The Tap Tap, we are constantly joking about this and we say that we are the only group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to postpone or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you elaborate on this?
This is a national fund-raising exercise that we have been planning for two years now.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which was announced on 21 December at 11:10 p.m.
The day before that, on December 20th at 21:00, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava will be held in parallel.
They will end, roughly speaking, at a time when a May calendar will be completed on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, which is 12 hours ahead of us.
Who had this idea in mind?
Initially, it was my idea, and then we all came up with our artist Gonza Augusto.
In addition to building up enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to reflect with the public on the state in which this world is going to be passed on to our children.
At the end of the May calendar, we created a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world, and these items can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz and thus support us together.
The Tap group, along with other musicians, also filled a hymn against the end of the world, called “The end of the light is canceled”.
Will YouTube’s audience-loving anthem at these benefiss concerts be heard?
Of course, at the end of the day, if it all works out and the end of the world doesn't come.
He will be sung by all the performers at all concerts simultaneously.
At the same time, the hymns are also heard in direct Czech television.
The song was written and played by Jesus in Thomas Ganak's video, and also by Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We also cooperate with other people of Czech cultural life, as we do many charity activities and concerts.
We are trying to actively involve them in these projects.
Turns out, many like to work with us, and they're interested.
What's the benefit of the concert against the end of the world?
For the purchase of equipment for the STEDEO barberless educational centre, we have been working for the sixth year with the Tap civil association at the Edlichki Institute.
Teachers regularly attend the Schools of the Edlichka Institute and have fun and interesting activities with them.
Students themselves do not have the means to go to teachers, and we try to give them this opportunity.
In the framework of the project for the further construction of the Edlička Institute, there will be a separate building in the future to which we will move with this project.
There will be several musical groups and performers at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We have tried to develop a programme that will interest all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague there will be Chinese, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Irji Suhi.
Both details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such “gradious activities” in the future?
In May we will be performing for the first time at the Prague Spring festival and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would love to have a presentation at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, even if we were in the United States, would like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
As far as you're concerned, you've already made serious plans in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Group is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with your organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it looks at first sight.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their wheels must travel in the baggage compartment, plus all the large loads and tool boxes.
However, as long as they were able to do so without any problems, the Czech airlines of ČSA and British airlines of British Airways have always been excellently prepared for us, which surprised me many times.
Even in Moscow, where we came from recently, it all went smoothly.
Visits abroad allow you to compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public relations with persons with disabilities and so on.
What have you experienced so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where everything works better than we do, in Russia, we have witnessed that it is still at the base in the east.
Compared to Prague in Moscow, there are still many barriers, and there is still an independent movement of the person on the electric wheelchair in the city centre.
It's also out of the ordinary of walking the road to a disabled person in an elevator.
Fortunately, there are already social organizations that are trying to draw people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the contrary, should we constantly catch up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things that are far behind.
But it is important to clarify that improving and improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is normal for people with severe disabilities to move on their own in the streets, go to the toilets, to museums, anywhere...
It's not very common that a lot of people with disabilities are actively involved in public life, and the Tap Tap and I are a little ahead of them!
Respect for the public or barbarity is one thing, but at a time when we have known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, everything will really start to change.
As long as it's a single case, people with strong will.
The Tap Tap group is now very popular, but will we be back two years ago, which made you organize it in 1998?
I went to the Edlichka Institute as a tutor, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician myself, and I'm also a saxophone player, my colleague and I have organized an interesting musical circle.
Well, over time, as our lead Lady Angelovic says, it's a little out of control.
The popularity has only come in recent years, or am I confused?
True, it helped us to join the famous singers and to work actively to promote the band.
We have come to the conclusion that a job that no one can appreciate actually does not exist.
Through the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Did you have the goal of twisting The Tap so well?
From the beginning, I felt their ability to do something extraordinary.
There's a lot of stuff in Shaw's business that mimics each other.
It makes sense, all the new things are taken with care, and it lasts for a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us, of course, is pity, of course...
But this regret is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not some suffering and all destitute persons that we must regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities do make a difference, it's not only for them, it's for society as a whole.
Has it been a success to know that you are a strict leader, as many consider you?
If we want to do good work, we must be uncompromising in many things and maintain certain disciplines.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us romantically and fly in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to rehearsals twice a week, go to pre-school and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose their enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently, there are twenty-one members of The Tap Tap.
How many were there in early 1998?
Only one Lady Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's impossible to prevent.
For those with will and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will be held the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday, 2010.12.2012, at 2 p.m.
The concert will take place in Prague at Incheba Stadium, Brno - Club Fléda and Ostrava - in the center of Plynoim with the participation of 12 groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are joined together by telestom at the time of the song by The Tap Tap "The End of Light is Canceled".
The purpose of the project is to raise 25 million kroner funding for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO educational centre at the Edlichki Institute in Prague.
The ticket to the concert is 400 crowns, for children under the age of 12 the entrance is free, and tickets can be purchased in advance at Bohemiaticque.
Poland and space.
Last week, a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency of Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second member of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and over the years that followed, it actively participated in a number of agency projects.
But Poland's path to space began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in space voyages, but that was not always understood.
I recall, for example, a lecture by A. Sternfeld, who presented the ideas of his innovative work, “Introduce into space,” at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933.
The ideas of a young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years Stternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Hadodomsky had an interest in his work.
In 1934, in France, Stternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltry Award and André Luis Hirsch Award for "Introduction to Space Science".
Dr. Jan Hadodomsky (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great advocate of astronomy and space science.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadovsky became a world-renowned space propagandist, and his contribution was appreciated, including the fact that one of the craters on the back of the moon was named after him.
By 1925, a railway sawmill had been built in Poland, equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether a rocket was to be used for the race or for the towing of a calf.
The information on this outfit is known only from the press of that era.
Since 1933, Polish artillery has begun to think about rocket launchers.
The study was carried out by the Armed Technology Section in collaboration with Professors Mechislav Wolfke and Gustav Mokzitzki.
The remaining materials show that the studies have reached the practical test stage.
But with the German troops coming, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the specialized press came up with the idea of a photoelectric fighter rocket proposed by Rogosinski, and the work of the author Léliva-Kzivoblocski, Air Torpedo Missile and Air Bomb, came out next year.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
The Interim Scientific and Advisory Committee (Temporary Advisory and Scientific Committee) coordinated all the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of its work it was completed because of the outbreak of war.
The next scientific work on space science appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society.
For the first time, society is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the magazine Problems, which publishes four large articles on astronautism.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovic suggested organizing a space-based society.
At the time, the projects of artificial satellites were already being developed, and space research was clear to be a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (POA) has tried to join the international Federation of Astronauticalism (founded in 1951), and has become a real member of the Polish PLA in autumn.
The following year, the first president, Kazimezh Zarankevich (1902-1959), became Vice-President of the International Federation of Astronauticals.
He remained in that position until his death, which came in 1959.
Since 1956, PAA has made a significant contribution to the very successful meteorological missile RM (Rakieta Meteorological), which became the first Polish missile to carry out scientific research.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and the first launch was held on 10 October 1958.
A missile capable of overcoming a distance of 1800 metres was about 80 cm long and weighing less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of RM-1A was built and two-step RM-2 rocket tests were conducted in the summer of 1959.
The rocket was approximately 1.4 metres long, with a weight of approximately 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was already able to do the present scientific work - the RM-34 rocket could have been over 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high wind.
But further development was suspended in 1962.
The first RM-type missile was inherited by Meteor-1, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-step, its total length was 510 cm and its initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (defined as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed in the size of the space for scientific equipment.
Meteor-1A had an area of 0.4 l, Meteor-1B - 0.34 l and Meteor-1C - 0.62 l.
The maximum flight distance of all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Aviation Institute developed the Meteor-2 rocket and began its first flight tests in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with a starting weight of 380 kg was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
The versions of Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were then built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland ' s accession to COSPAR (the Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the National Committee of COSPAR two years later.
In addition, within the framework of the Intercosmos programme, Poland participated in space studies on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslav Hermashewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The abolition of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the Public Works Act.
The decision sparked a lively debate in society.
It would certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unfettered movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the cost of the labour force (remuneration) there is a price voltage.
This is to be understood as a situation where the producer, through the delivery of cheap goods, tries to compete in an economic competitive way by reducing the cost of the competitor in order to collect a large part of the market and thereby increase its own income.
On a large scale, this means that most entrepreneurs either move their production abroad or buy cheap abroad or disappear, which results in higher unemployment in countries where labour costs are higher than others.
As private capital has no social responsibility, including for unemployment, the inevitable social costs of the State are increasing.
In general, the situation exacerbates the reluctance of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby offset the public economic and social damage they have suffered in the pursuit of profits.
The situation is so well known that specific statistics are not required.
Unceremonious private capital practices have created a situation at the economic level of individual States where governments are forced to compete with one another in order tortificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, Governments have given their own people to arbitrary private capital, despite social declines.
This is reflected primarily in changes to existing legislation.
The aim is to make their people submit to the private capital dictatorship, particularly in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for cutting down workers ' rights in labour law.
As a result, poverty levels are increasing, but the difference between the poor and the rich is also increasing.
In the FWG, there has been a public distribution of food to the poor for several years, who are unable to feed on their own work.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
In the context of improving the competitiveness of the German economy, there are always cases in which workers receive such wages that the State must pay them back so that they receive a minimum subsistence allowance.
Such a scandal has become known to the public in the case of additional Bundestag employees.
Economic measures in almost all EU southern States certainly lead to the same situation in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in social status are either forced to emigrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or to live on a poor salary on social backwoods, in the hope that private investment will ever be made in the country.
But I wonder where he's going to come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African is still working for European wages.
This applies to Latin America as a whole.
The liberal theory and the media, up to a point of decency, argue that a State cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, which leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists that the State should not intervene in the economy by administering actions.
Further, should the question be answered as to whether private capital, now practically the policy manager and the whole State, for their own selfish purposes?
The answer is yes.
Evidence is the existence of virtually all-powerful and ubiquitous lobbies in all States.
As a result, we have an inconvenient situation in corruption, mutual benefits, in legislation where almost everyone deserves to be punished, but it is not a crime.
In the FWG, government ministries are tasked with drafting bills to private legal firms that are closely related to industry because of lack of financial resources.
Then these bills are passed by Bundestag.
All authority is based, not on the people, on the Western Constitution, but on the financial and power groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that a liberal-oriented democracy is now rapidly becoming a situation as described by Appian in the work “Chrysis of the Roman Empire in the Days of Caesar and Pompeii”: “The State has long been broken up and the authorities have been violent.
Bribery, unlawful receiving of mercy with stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and the people went to elections with a pre-sold vote" ...good people did not run for the position of governor at all, after all, once the state for eight months was without a consul." "Seriously they began to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation was self-government and the need to choose a vigorous man ". Appian thought it would be Pompey, but they had become Caesar, who had finally changed democracy to self-state.
As in ancient times, modern society is dominated by its own reckless interests without taking into account public interests.
Private capital is, in essence, no longer intended for public use.
The present outcome is not different from the past: the unprecedented decline of the elite without any effort to undertake reforms of a deeper nature.
Therefore, the reason for the emergence of fascist and communist regimes must be sought in the reckless liberalization of economic systems of 19 and 20 centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal democracy can be seen as a pause, after which the next tour is expected.
At the outset, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we have already seen, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a decision or at least not forever.
Under pressure from both international and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
The trend is thus systemic.
The solutions are targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen State participation in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the governance of the State and weaken the monopolistic position of private capital in society in favour of the State.
Israel: Chaos Laboratory.
"No violence will ever come out," Sting, the song "Thunders," where the main poem of the chorus is, "We don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons hadn't wanted war, they wouldn't have been" -- the dying Gutel Schnaper, the wife of Meer Amschel Rothchild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as usual, caused numerous reactions.
Some are in favour of Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defence, while Palestinians act as terrorists, others support Palestinians, arguing that it is the racism of the Israeli State, the genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is credited with the role of a terrorist State.
I do not want to think about who, in these recurring waves of killings, is a criminal, and who the victim, after all, today's Israeli citizens, including self-ruled territories, were born at the time of the current political situation, and have not witnessed the outbreak of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look at the curtains, to look at who, first and foremost, are the 95-year-old voltages (considered since the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) at a small part of the land of the Middle East.
Some of my reasonings are supported by historical facts, some of which are derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main engine of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of power struggle.
In every age, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
Which is not so clear - whether these people have always taken their own steps or have been followed by someone who has guided them to their predetermined goals.
It should be assumed that we are living at a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have occurred for a generation of lives.
Among the astronomically rich families is one who could be considered as the head of the spore (I don't know if anyone is standing above them, but that's not excluded) - Rotshilda.
They don't write much about them.
Of course.
The first news agency (Rayters) they bought in the 1990s to stop rumors that linked their name to the crimes in the highest realms in which they were in the shadows, and that always led to the strengthening of their power, the increase of wealth or both.
They have large stock packages in almost all the central banks of the world, and against countries whose central banks do not have their share, they wage war or prepare war (only 7 countries were invaded in Afghanistan, 5 countries were in Iraq after the invasion, and only four were left after the collapse of Qaddafi, but at the same time the Russian Government took the central bank of its country into its hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain the status of the central bank for the Rothhilld Bank of America; during the civil war, he began to issue his own (under government) money and was killed in 1865 at the theater.
John F. Kennedy began to issue his own money and wanted to cancel the Fed (Federal Reserve) system, was killed in 1963 and Deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue the FED for resolving the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to the development of a plan of three world wars created by the great 33rd-level mass of Albert Pike.
The task of the first war was to destroy the monarchy States in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially the British, and the third was to reduce the world population to approximately 0.5-1 billion people (such numbers of slaves will be sufficient to provide their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume much resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism cannot be anything but a prerequisite for such a project) and the eventual capture of absolute power.
The method by which a group of the richest families headed by Rothhilldami is to challenge the crisis and then propose solutions (order ab chao - order from chaos).
But these solutions are false and have always led to a deterioration of the situation (see the FED basis, which should have prevented a recurrence of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they succeeded in unleashing the First World War by killing the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the royal Russia, beginning the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended in sudden, unwarranted and economic terms by the surrender of Germany (no longer needed war to destroy the Kingdom of Russia) and the fragmentation of the Central European Power, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the dissolution of the Second World War, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, imposing huge military reparations on Germany, rather than creating a prerequisite for the radicalization of the day-to-day masses, then only to throw the Germans strong enough, dressed the perpetrators and offering simple solutions to the leader, further to establish a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and indeed to play the role of the fifth column in fuelling the war.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothhillda was provoked by the Zionist movement, one of which was seeking to establish a Jewish State, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned declaration by Balfour created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks took place on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, it was difficult to assess whether Hitler had broken out of the chains in which he was originally held by the bankers, or all he had done was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps had created preconditions for the Jewish State to be recognized by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany had been provoked by military reparations for the 2nd World War, the State of Israel had been declared to form a third-war hearth.
If international bankers were able to untie it, the Jewish people, as in World War II, would be the victims of fighting on the front line, now together with the Arab or, more simply, the Muslim people of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of strife and chaos not only within the country but also at the international level (to take only a sharp division of people into Israeli supporters and opponents).
Who are the perpetrators, and who are the victims of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where insults cause insults in an endless chain of violence if all began with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
There is a need to distinguish the common people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers are sending people to vote in exclusively their own candidates.
The Israeli Prime Minister, Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international banker politician who is doing all he can to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran ' s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to grow into a world conflict and, given Iran ' s control over the Ormuz Strait, which accounts for 20 per cent of the world ' s oil reserves (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words now expressed by David Rockefeller in 1994: “All we need is a common crisis, and people will accept the new world order”.
The new world order in their representation is the world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves as a handful of financial aristocracy, enjoying comfort.
A world where each born organism is implanted at birth by a chip with which it becomes a substance under total control.
"And compels all the small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to have glue on their right hand or on their forehead, so that a man who is not marked by the name of that beast, or by the number of his name, cannot buy or sell.
The wisdom of this is that everyone who has reason can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to the name of the human being, and the number is six hundred sixty-six.
The movie "Operation Argo": When it gets worse, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamic demonstrators took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrow of Mohammed Reza Pehlevi, who had fled after the revolution in the United States, which had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, the positive outcome was not anticipated - it could not afford to throw chess overboard, because it could undermine the trust of allies in other countries.
However, achieving the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was not in a position to do so.
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later strengthened by a failed attempt to release the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were finally released 444 days later, after negotiations under the mediation of the Government of Algeria.
Their fate has sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The defeat in Iran has greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election that culminated in the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film by Ben Affleck, "Operation Argo", describes one episode of the story that brought America small victories.
Shortly before the embassy was occupied, six workers escaped.
After a difficult moment, they finished their journey to the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, was able to withdraw them from Iran, helping with an extravagant covert legend that they had left Canada's passports as members of the film team seeking a place in the country to take pictures of the science-fiction era.
Compilation of genres
The plan that Tony Mendez invented to evacuate required the cooperation of Hollywood.
In order to make the legend credible, the specialized journals wrote about the film, organized press conferences, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, a film based on Tony Mendez's memoirs.
Aflek's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political thriller, the so-called film-cynoopus, the story of a good deal, an affair -- an example of a number of films about Ocean's friends.
The film is constantly changing moods - on the one hand, documentary scenes from Tehran (the captions show marked historical photographs of events and how the same situations were shown in the film - there are no significant differences).
On the other hand, lightening Hollywood passages, intersecting with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then there's a scene at CIA headquarters and other institutions -- men in suits are discussing the situation behind the negotiating tables, on the scales of the institutions, on the phone...
Ben Afleku had a remarkable career resurgence.
The ridiculed actor became a respected director, and his play ceased to be the object of ridicule.
"Operation Argo" of his third full-length film, followed by a dark detective, "Goodbye, Baby Goodbye" (2007) and a thriller, "City" (2010).
At the same time, it is the first film by Aflek, which is not produced in the hometown of the director, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place is one of the qualities that promoted the earlier films of the director above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it at Argo where Tehran plays Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening scenes of the embassy's fall are impressed by their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unforeseenities that arise when history is suddenly changing somewhere.
The seeming effect of Aflek and his colleagues is reached in the scenes of fiction (the counterfeit headquarters at the Tehran Market).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative did not imply a multitude of breathtaking scenes of cinematographic significance.
He's working with this little guy pretty well, and sometimes he's thinking about something -- it's not all that elegant out there (the scene where the phone call in America prevents the impending crisis at Tehran Airport, and the pursuit of the runway looks pretty pretentious).
Argo's lack of space is the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman, as Hollywood colleagues, are indeed very promising, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are far from unique in the film.
Aflek's film lacks a little drama, it's a film that can be watched with moderate interest, evaluating the design and retro-style that recreates the seventieth thrillers.
But it's hard.
After all, this is enough to remind us of one, still in a familiar sense of living history, as well as to show how the notions of all the powerful and all-knowing services are exaggerated.
Air balls, bananas and circus regulations
The web portal www.bankovnipoplaki.com, interviewing annually on the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to contest “the most absurd decision or project from the EU workshop”.
“We have achieved this latest event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the management of major European companies”, said the “Right” co-organizer of the interrogator Patrick Nager.
Among the pre-nominated absurdities, the recent decision of the European Court to pool the rate of premiums for men and women.
So far, women have enjoyed life insurance benefits because insurance companies are objectively less at risk.
“Further incredible ideas from the master's EU can be put forward by the end of this year.
The vote will take place until the end of February 2013,” Nager said.
The EU's controversial regulations include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel resulting in damage to nature, as well as the ban on the use of reliable mercury gradients only because they contain a relatively small number of hazardous substances, or a cell size directive for chickens, resulting in significant egg travel this year.
The term “buterbrode oil” has also been effectively banned or removed from the sale of classical lamps.
The quality bananas must be 14 cm long.
The Pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by a State or group of States (the Czech Republic now even threatens to defend the demands of its banks).
The interests of the lobby are as follows: for example, the highest quality bananas in the European Union were to reach 14 cm long and do not dare to show "anonymous curvature".
At the same time, the European Commission was justified by harmonising existing disparate national rules that made trade more difficult.
The EU, despite the resistance of some States, has still softened the standards for fruit and vegetables, recalling that existing directives will lead to the dissolution of products.
An EU ruling last year may also become a candidate for winning the poll, under which air balloons sold must be given a warning that children under eight years of age are not allowed to do so without the supervision of adults.
The EU has approached American studies that indicate that balloons at play are the potential cause of death of children by strangulation.
This restriction now applies to children under the age of 14 who are prohibited from going to the fair.
Fun ideas are also born at home
Also absurd is the rule concerning European officials themselves: anyone who has an official position in the EU cannot, given the sensitivity of the topic to Greece, use the name Macedonia and instead use the name BYRM (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The BankovniPoplatky.com portal, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists, “The Principles of Non-Discrimination” (Laissez Faire), proposed a vote, in addition to several of the above absurd rules, such as the EU regulation on the level of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set the maximum amount of food stocks that may be in the territory of the Czech Republic at the date of its accession to the European Union.
The Czech Republic subsequently exceeded, for example, the prescribed quantities of preserved mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a large fine.
The interviewers were also interested in paying some countries for their lack of sea and the idea of granting subsidies for applications for grants.
But these ideas were created in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We're at a disadvantage because we don't have a sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation," said then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSDP) in autumn 2004.
He argued that there was a high crop of grain in the country and that, as a result of the so-called intervention procurement, the State had stockpiling stocks that had to be exported.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from the ports, the EU, according to the Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission met the Czech Republic by holding a tender for the purchase of grain from landlocked countries.
Subsidies to receive the grant were offered to the villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, led by Minister Paul Germany (US-DEU), in particular, to go to apply for grants from Brussels.
EU: Strange orders are the exception
While decisions in Member States are easily criticized, EU efforts to regulate, as well as to improve the functioning and development of the European Union, many experts believe that they deserve recognition.
A serious problem, experts believe, is the drawing of EU grants on projects that have no idea of anything in common with the deepening of European integration, but which Member States have achieved in discussing the budget.
The Czech Republic, like other countries of the European Union, has to fight in Brussels for the right to a specific identification of its traditional products, and does not always win this contest.
Although Czechs, after six years of fighting with Germans and Austrians, have retained the name "Olomouc cheeses", but "Tusemian Roma", whose traditions in our country were rooted in the 19th century, our producers were to be named "Tuzemak".
It can be called rum, not sugar beet.
In the official list of registered EU products, along with the world-famous cheeses "feta" and "gorgondzole", marzipan from the German Ljubek or the Parmian Vetchina, there have already been, for example, carlovar drylands, garish and trošebonic carp and tortoise hops.
Also a trademark of the EU can be proud of the Pardubite pen and the bitter tubes.
People want me to protect the republic, but I'm a fan, says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a man get in his head to run for president?
I'm not thinking of becoming a senator or a president myself.
If everything was working in our country without a problem, I wouldn't be running around.
But I can't see how the country's been expanding over the past 20 years, how there are thieves, people increasing taxes and retirement age.
I didn't have ambitions to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, I'm trying to figure out how to change it.
And since I am forty years old and I am an independent person who is not a party, I have no other way of affecting things than running for the position of senator or president.
You went to the Senate, but soon you went to the presidential castle.
Do you not turn your back on the people who chose you?
I always said I'd be involved in fighting for the presidential castle, depending on the outcome of the Senate elections.
I later explained that if I were to be elected senator, I would be running for presidents.
My goal is not a post, a post is a tool by which I can carry out my views.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the widest powers.
But the challenge is not just that we as a nation are pampering in a bar or a TV, but are willing to melt anyone who tries to change something.
This is accompanied by media who defile the person and confuse the freedom of speech with the freedom of lies.
For example, I was told that I was bribery to journalists, or that I was the adviser to Irji Paroubec.
Let's move on to your views.
You have begun fighting for the presidential castle with allegations of political financial and criminal responsibility and reverse property declarations worth more than twenty million.
In order to do so, it is necessary to amend the law.
You do not have such authority as President, and only a whole Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to do this?
When I lobbyed for tours as a citizen to become a free enterprise, it was possible to move forward.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good offer on the left or on the right, they deliberately interfere with it, and it deters citizens.
As an independent non-party person, I have much greater capacity to obtain support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what's best for our country without party folds, without looking at dogmas, and apply it.
Do you consider yourself to be more of a right or left person?
From a Czech point of view, I think people refer me to the left.
It doesn't matter to me at all, a little to the left or a little to the right.
For me, it's important that we move forward.
It's not that someone is right-handed, but someone is left-handed, I want to unite people.
I will always support any good decision for society whether it will be offered by the HR Committee or the GDP, and I will also be against a bad idea.
You're angry when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for the firm, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And you're trying to get close to it.
We can call it populism, but all the suggestions I'm talking about are already working in the world or are being made by eminent experts.
But without Parliament's support, you'll only have slogans.
And with that in politics, you won't last long.
Or do you think that when you go out and talk to people, you will be able to exercise criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have a chance.
Just to convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to turn them on our side so we can do our part.
If I had been elected President, it would not have been a problem to organize a direct television broadcast, in which I would appeal to the Presidents of Parliament to legitimize material and criminal liability for politicians, public officials, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they will have to tell them why they don't want to.
If there is a strong personality that will sound abuses, there will be pressure on the political scene.
Take the President's direct election was a public pressure.
I'm saying that I'm a lover, not a genius, not an intellectual.
I try to seek allies to uphold my beliefs and views.
I'm just a politician, and for my program, I'm going to try to get the support of the majority.
I try to move on my own; if this fails, I will finish in six years and return to the private sector.
This part sounds like Okamura must save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything, so I've missed a number of famous people with an offer to run into the Senate.
I went to Radim Yanchure, and he refused to do a lot of work.
I also at least supported journalist Ian Lorentsov's lead investigation, which revealed fraud with light fuel oil products.
I put out my candidacy because people are really unhappy, but now I feel like I'm on my weight.
Sixty per cent of the people did not go to the elections, but most of the people who had elected representatives of the estate.
There are only two of us independent in the Senate.
The people chose the Senate so that changes would be difficult.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my views, such as the direct election of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking about the basis of your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to verify the purity of every potential proponent's past, and I don't have any money for it.
There's no money on the presidential campaign, and there's only 20,000 crowns in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property statements, and how are your own business with this?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have an area in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment of 10 million, another apartment of 8 million, an art collection of about 10 million, an Aston Martin by 3.5 million and a Superb Scoda per million, and a few more million on account.
By the way, I had an Aston-Martin show because it was my little dream, and I always liked James Bond, who was riding on a car, being gallant with women, and at the same time struggling against meanness and lawlessness.
You're going to Aston Martin, you own $60 million, and you don't have the money to campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I've already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program isn't that interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the election campaign from my pocket.
The cost of campaigning will essentially cover the senator's salary.
But I wouldn't live on that money, for example, if I couldn't pay my son for an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
So you'll continue to do business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd cut it down?
But it doesn't depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, my work has been reduced in part.
For example, the manager of the travel agency will be my deputy in the spring.
People would like me to be a silversmith to keep the republic.
But there's something I need to live on, too.
How much business did you get used to getting a month?
Two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I still get.
And if I were to be president, I'd finish my business.
You'll find a full interview on Saturday's "Right."
MVRDV architects prove that real adventures are not only in imagination, like Spikenniss and his recently built Mountain of Books - 2 photos
"I find this building fun, it looks futuristic, we can finally see something interesting again," says Lisette Verhaig, crossing the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist in a big business nearby, says, "No, it's a really beautiful building."
But I'm asking myself, why do we need another library today?
Everyone has Internet, iPad and electronic books.
No one's volunteering to go to those old-fashioned libraries now, right?
Spacenis, a small sleeping town under Rotterdam, has an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
In order to combat this annoying circumstance, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to build seven fictional bridges, which are depicted in euro banknotes, in the form of picturesquely decorated iron miniatures.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
Then the city’s fathers realized that they had the only chance to resist the statistics: to build a library here!
Winnie Maas, from the rotterdam architectural office MVRDV, master of bold pillar diagrams and author of witty, sometimes even cynical structures, presented himself with his usual irresistibleness and appeared at a competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under a mouse and a smile on his face.
And while members of the jury were puzzled by looking around and chewing their shoulders, the bold Maas made a pyramid of his original gift in size and finished his speech in defence of his project by saying, "Dear City!"
Here it is, my suggestion: "The Book of the Mountain" in Spikenis, the so-called Buckenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain, worth 30 million euros, grew.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes a underground garage, a supermarket, post office and several adjacent dwellings and taverns for a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, Book Mountain was awarded the second prize of "Lucy Library of the Netherlands 2012".
The project also participates in the Dutch National Timber Competition 2012.
Thus, a viscous suburb, which had previously been unable to offer anything other than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an amazingly beautiful garden whose white facades suggest a dairy plant, has become richer for one modern design.
Above all, there was the first public cultural building in the history of this town.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression is that the book Eldorado is under the cheese cap.
There is only one elevator in the center of the mountain mass, for true architects and readers prefer to explore the area by foot.
A glass room on all sides is light and easily observable, the fields of hysterical brick and elegant street lights create a sense of public urban space.
The urban environment is restored perfectly.
Looks like they're not allowed to look for pebbles, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere -- books, books, books.
“The bookshelves usually stand along the facades, and there is a big, dark hall in the middle, usually cosy and faceless,” says Vinnie Maas.
We put the classic configuration of the space on the head and pulled the reading zone from the inside out.
The internal space of the book mountain was used skillfully, with offices, Internet libraries, chess club, environmental centre and technical facilities at the centre.
In particular, black bookshelves, which serve as wall separations, are parapets, or railings.
Their appearance, texture, and smell are unusual.
Even experienced architects and construction engineers are lost in their minds, which is for unknown material.
“We tried to work with secondary materials”, explains Jopp Trauborst, the project manager representing the Spikenisse community, according to the standards.
And once at an agrarian enterprise in Frisland, we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years, artificial fiberglass material of a millimeter thickness has been used as a base in heat and fields in the Netherlands.
It's cheap and it saves time.
Thin textiles serve one or two seasons, then they can be dropped.
For the library, this canvas — for the first time in such volumes — was placed in panels with a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, so-called landbauplastic (KLP) becomes a dark, homogeneous, durable material, a slightly resembling new car and a little cross.
The top is 105 degrees.
Those who make the journey nearly 500 metres long will be rewarded in a literary café not only with a fantastic view of the city but also with Dutch croquets and wood fissures in pots.
They care for the atmosphere, especially the proper humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
Expenses per new soul
“It is hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, is a model environmental project”, said Troubourst.
The heat of the earth is used for heating and cooling.
Although the Mount of Genesis is under a glass cap, even in clear days, the sun only falls inside for a little while.
Large glued timber farms, perpendicular to the glass facade, provide shade and absorb most of the sun’s rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The remaining protection is provided by fully automatic steering curtains.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned above, has already visited a new library.
Lisette Verhaig was here as well.
She was also a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bogard, who called Bukenberg "soul Spikenisse, who was long overdue".
Reason: A few weeks before the opening, each householder was invited to contribute a book from his own congregation.
These books were supposed to be filled with empty spaces in the regiments of the incomplete library -- at that time there were 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The shelves are up there.
"There's nothing worse than a semi-empty library," says architect Winnie Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, now everyone living in some ways is connected to this new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if she only serves for decoration.
The MVRDV has thus managed to meet the royal task of creating identity on a professional jargon.
Spikenniss wrote his literary history.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
It's just a starting point for building an identity.
Saba: “Germany should play a more important role”
Germany abstained in the vote to recognize Palestine.
In Stephen Sabo's view, the US-Europe liaison expert, in this way, Berlin balances on the narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany initially made it clear that it would vote against Palestinian applications for observer status with the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli action in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I do not believe that the American position is supportive either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
Germany also abstained in a vote to establish a no-fly zone during the June 2011 Libya uprising.
As a result, NATO has made this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The point is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, that is, from a policy that the United States, to its own German foreign policy, has ruled.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that Europeans do not have an agreed common policy.
Thus, the Germans are again between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that as long as they only get their part, they're on their way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy that France or Britain is pursuing.
What exactly does “normal” external policy mean in German terms?
This willingness to take a position that is independent of the position of the United States or European partners in their national interest.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policies, i.e. exports and links with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany ' s economic interests differ greatly from those of other major States, and Germany must therefore protect its interests.
Did these economic interests affect the position of the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
First, Germany has major markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
It therefore needs to be careful not to insult the public and the elite in Arab countries.
Either way, it's playing a role.
But I wouldn't attach too much importance to it, it's not a completely unilateral relationship.
But in any case, this plays an important role in the German calculations.
Did Germany damage its relations with the United States by refraining from making important decisions, such as the Palestinian vote?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States, there is an understanding of the German position.
So I don't think it was as dramatic as the Libyan question.
Germany may even gain some respect in this way.
This indicates that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that its interests should be considered.
There are various views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the contrary, the United States had made a clear statement in favour of the veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European States?
Because of American domestic policy, there have always been such differences.
I believe that the Obama Government has a sufficient understanding of the European position.
However, in the context of the local political situation, the Government cannot, of course, take such an open stand.
I believe that substantial differences of opinion are not as significant as it always seems.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not at all pleased with Netanyahu's policy.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the EU's most important partner on the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a single, non-controversial European policy, but now it is not.
Therefore, they cannot take a broader approach and are forced to act instead, based only on their own vision of the situation.
That's how they do with the euro.
I think that in the future, Germany will take the lead in developing a common European position.
Clearly, it is not easy for Germany, at least because of its ties with Israel.
The subject has always been sensitive.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany itself sees itself as an important international player, would it not really play a major role?
Or is it still difficult for Germany to take the lead?
Germany has not yet gotten used to this, it is still always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still hard to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis, each time Germany assumes an important role, there are a wide range of anti-German feelings.
It's not just the Germans to deal with it.
In fact, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It should take into account a wide range of neighbours and views, and that is not easy.
So, the U.S. influence in European politics is constantly weakening, but at this point the EU is not filling this vacuum, but who is then remaining?
Germans will simply have to play a larger role.
Even if you don't like it, it doesn't feel good or it makes you feel unloved, it's life!

"Protection of trademarks" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani - a world-renowned trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren - too.
But what is Armani Polo?
It is a completely officially registered name in China that has nothing to do with the firms from which it was formed.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names have brought a claim.
But then it is not clear whether they will be able to assert their rights.
"Foreigners find it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China," said Thomas Patloh, Taylor Wessing's lawyer, specializing in infringements of trademark rights in the Far East.
On my desk, every week a new case of this kind appears.
It is sufficient for copycats to add only a few letters in order to obtain the right to register their trademarks.
This is how Gucci gets Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, you can register Prada-Kny.
In this same way, German enterprises, such as the sports producer Puma, are legally copied.
Patloch opens a folder with the Beijing Trade Mark Registration Office records.
On 14 September 2010, the Chinese company registered the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also used the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are the world's champions of copying and violating intellectual property rights is known.
In large cities there are multi-storey universities that sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.
However, these are not the cases of Patloha; on instructions from his trustees, he objected to the fact that the Chinese enterprises were given the right to use a name that was already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "ban minpai", the passenger brand.
This word is associated with Ban Dakuan.
That's what they call women who hunt for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not plead guilty
"This is damaging business, and this must be combated," says Patloch.
"The brand is blurring, the unique situation is losing, the image is suffering very badly."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are calculated by millions, especially in the case of expensive products copied.
According to the CLSA Market Research Company, China, with a sales volume of 15 billion euros per year, is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods.
However, it is difficult to remove doubtful records in the trade mark register, and it is expensive.
The process can last up to nine years, with unclear results.
Pattloch describes the cases in which the court dismissed the claim, since after a long time the contested name became “the reality of the market”.
If he is not lucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarism because he has damaged his trademark in China, says Patloch.
Sometimes the jungle law rules here.
There are also famous cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a lawsuit with the construction vehicle manufacturer Sany, an enterprise that had previously acquired a concrete-associated company called Putzmeister.
Thus, the Chinese still have the right to use an emblem similar to the star Mercedes.
The purchased Volvo company Geely originally used a blue and white logo that resembled BMW; the process was successful, and Geely had to change it.
Lacoste's fashion product manufacturer lost to Hong Kong and Singapore copycats who had the famous crocodile looking at the other side in China.
The Chinese authorities do not find themselves guilty.
The registration of CTMO trademarks in Beijing confirms that in 2010 there were difficulties owing to the lack of staff and equipment there.
But last year there was a “return from emergency in the working process to normal”.
Thus, the number of outstanding cases for objections decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
However, 81.500 claims are still pending in the department.
Coping With It Is Worth It
As often as it is in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China has, for the tenth consecutive time, chaired a list of new registrations worldwide, reported to the agency.
The same applies to the total number of actual trademarks, just 5.5 million grand.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan fees were paid.
Simplification means that each registration costs an average of 1280 Yuan or 160 Euros.
It is worth much more than that, as the case of the German family firm Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the concert has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarism.
The Germans succeeded in eliminating the illegal production of false car parts.
The copyist, however, enshrined the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
This was a personal omission, as names in Germany are not protected, says Hanno Wenttzler, Chairman of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities Board in Munich.
The CTMO trade mark registration agency also rejected the Munich claim.
True, Freudenberg has won in both of the following cases, but the opposing side continues to fight so far.
There's gotta be a watch.
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wenttzler hopes to bring the matter to a good conclusion and commends the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs were unlikely to be recorded, and the firm ' s archives had to be reviewed even centuries ago to bring evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing side a “large six-figure sum in euros” for a settlement.
"It's clear how expensive this is for us," Wenttzler says.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to drift even to Europe.
That is, if copycats register unprotected trademarks there.
Thus, a Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for footwear and leather products.
The Congress had long ceased production in these areas, but nevertheless had been able to prevent registration.
"We need to be on the line," said Wenttzler.
Both he and Lawyer Pattloch recommend that German enterprises be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international provisions for the protection of trademarks; rather, foreigners should “all that is worth protecting in any way should also register in China” said Ventsler.
Otherwise it could be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the latest act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the opposing party license fees for his own name, explains Ventzler.
Otherwise, they'll push us out of the market in a controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: Swing, Sing, Help
In Heidelberg, Imbongi chorus rehearses — and AIDS orphans rejoice in Swaziland.
The history of relations that have crossed more than 1,733 kilometres.
First, drowning is given: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, ladies' boats, and men's taps pick up the tact on the floor and find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Only after that do the voices of the alt, bass, tenor, and soprano grow slowly; they come in, charm and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, doesn't jump out of his mother-in-law when he leads them with flexible and expressive gestures.
On Monday evening, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, Chor Imbongi is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty participants from 23 to 69 years of age, from a genetic specialist to a palace, attended the rehearsal.
Om Obani is an unforgivable thing, every voice of people has its own text, in a completely foreign language: Zulu, speaking eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self - Help
According to the United Nations AIDS programme, there are around 34 million people living with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 AIDS orphans.
At the same time, more than 40 per cent of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitani, the Voices for Africa found bosses in Germany.
Of these, 70 attend schools that prepare for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take over the headship.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniform and a daily hot meal at Gogo Centre.
Imbongi in the Zulu language means a storyteller or a praiser.
There's no running to the canopy in this hall, but they can sing.
For almost ten years the choir has been teaching songs in this foreign soft language, and occasionally it even brings them back to where they first appeared: South Africa.
In fact, at a distance of 8733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in northwestern Swaziland, there is the village of Esitzeni, which depends on the voice of the German people.
Forty per cent infected
There are about 2,000 people living there, some of whom still live in simple mud and straw huts, among the inhabitants of many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died of the IH virus.
In Esitani, the miniaturize reflects the disease of all of Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the world's lowest life expectancy according to UNICEF data.
The cutting of the extreme flesh in men, which has been proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, has hardly been accepted among the population.
More than forty per cent of the population in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, and death in the middle of the fourth decade is not uncommon.
Horus opened the village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but first the Imbognas saw many children in the streets, who lacked parental care, but also simply food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was a private obligation of individual participants - for a few euros a year to send the child to school and enable him to receive hot food once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the Voice for Africa association, which has since been almost professionally caring for AIDS orphans in Esitani.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Syphilis, chlamydiosis and Tripper (Honorrhea) refer to bacterial CPIs.
HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis are frequent viral STIs.
Lobby pediculosis and combs are included in parasitic STIs.
What are the main hit groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
Robert Koha Institute believes that in at least four out of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, transmission is due to sexual intercourse between men.
Heterosexual adults often have sexually transmitted diseases, including chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis, gonorrhea, and human papilloma virus.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of the new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are significantly more common than among other population groups.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections strike young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
We also have human papilloma virus among young people.
How do the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
Syphilis morbidity, according to Robert Koh Institute, has more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has declined since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
It's about one tenth less than last year.
What are the symptoms of a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases may include genital ulcers, complaints of urination, secretion, abdominal pain, and bubbles or embolism.
Often, however, they are not accompanied by pain or other symptoms and remain undetected.
How can you protect yourself?
condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
Some sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread through contact infection and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend a regular survey, especially with frequent change of sex partners.
In early diagnosis, the majority of SPIs can be cured and far-reaching effects avoided.
The headship, donations, and not least the fees for people around Germany to collect something.
"We have all sent to Eciteni already about 200,000 euros," said Annet Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, German money is managed by Tsodva Dlamini, a conscientious and active woman.
She also makes sure that orphans are well - arranged, such as one of the grandparents.
Gogos, as they say in Zulu old women, is the stronghold of the village.
Some of them have received up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads, and make sure that their children appear every day on time.
Those who do not have any family are admitted to a shelter in Hannisil, a single woman who receives a wage from the association, as are the two accidents that each day prepares for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, Voice for Africa organized a sewing school, built two smokers and organized a HIV analysis with the American health organization PSI for many villagers.
It is hard to imagine, but the disease that is so evident throughout the country is preferred to remain silent deeply.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," said Annet Lennartz, "because it's sexual."
Not unusual enough for a country where the king has officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such an authorized State life-style is also responsible for the rapid spread of the PM virus in past years.
But it also lies with stray workers who carry the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annet Lennartz, "but they're almost out of use.
Another culture is flesh to flesh."
To support a little cultural exchange, the Ibmogani choir travels south Africa every two to three years and sings songs full of sorrow, spirit, confidence and black self-awareness, which many on the southern edge of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in black - not only does such recognition bring good mood and joy, but even, it has caused tears to the eyes of harsh border guards.
The visit is also always to Esitzhen, where singers visit their children.
Although it is difficult to find a small village on the map, it is more known in the valley of the Etsulva River.
"Go to Esithen, that's where the world is," is what the people here say.
And after an 873-mile flight back to Heidelberg, when the melting singers return to the Bergheimer Street Hall, you can see that this light is on fire here as well.
Messinger: NASA opens ice on Mercury
The Messinger Zone has found evidence that there's ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet can have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA ' s space agency has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is nearer to the sun, there is also frozen water, as is evident from three studies published Thursday in the special magazine Science.
The Messinger Zone has found evidence that the planet's never-ending shadow will be covered by ice.
Its thickness must be at least 30 centimeters or perhaps up to 20 meters.
The water is supposed to be coming from a comet or perhaps an asteroid encountered by Mercury.
No one links the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said scientific leader Sean Solomon’s probe.
Mercury can have a temperature of 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help to explain how water and other building blocks of life have fallen into other parts of the solar system.
The depths of the universe are undetected for earth’s inhabitants, probes, telescopes and small robots, such as Fenix.
From time to time, they send images to the earth — small eyeglasses to endless dailies.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who deals with the Sun for Neptune, Ceres, according to the new definition of an international astronomical union of 2006, is not a “platon”.
This fragment of Spitzer’s infrared image represents the “family portrait” of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in blue dots, more difficult to identify in the star circle the pink “born” stars.
This skyscraper region -- the scientists call it W5 -- opened by the Spitzer telescope at Kasiopei constellation at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This glowing dying star photographed NASA's Spitzer telescope.
It looks like a donut ring consists of a material that the star threw up in the process of dying.
In the giant Nebula, Trifid, at 5,400 light-years away from the Earth, creates new stars from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this photo of a galactic maternity room.
A star cluster of the Pleiade, also called the Seven Sisters, can be seen with an unarmed eye at night.
Of course, with the telescope, the color gets better.
As the red eye flashes the observer's nebula on this infrared image.
It is 700 light-years away from the constellation of Wrather.
The congregation with the Earth's continent has brought this nebula the name North America.
The combination of a normal and infrared photograph provides a distinct colour transfer.
This new star has only been photographed beautifully with Spitzer telescope infrared sensors.
Saturn and his ring: As they arose, one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
It's probably the fragments of Saturn's moon, which disappeared 4,5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and brightest pictures of the Hubble telescope: the Hydrogen galaxy
Depending on the color of the photo transmission, spiral galaxies are transformed into actual works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the remote trifid nebula for several thousand light-years in the constellation of the Sagittarius.
The name Triphid occurs from the Latin word triphidus (threefold, three-part), because the dark strips of dust divide into three parts of the cradle of stars.
In the constellation of the Reaper, astronomers photographed a harbinger of a collision: 400 million light-years away from the Earth, two merging galaxies face each other and inevitably face each other.
This birth of the star Hubble telescope was recorded in a spiral galaxy of M83.
Anyone who doesn't like technical reductions can call it the Southern Pipeline.
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in Cephea's constellation.
The 1400 light-year fog consists of particles of dust that range from 10 to 100 times less than normal domestic dust.
This image was made up of optical and X-ray images of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes that is 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, which is known as the Arp 273 photographed the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The big spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
This star fog is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The starship is constantly creating new stars.
It is a star cloud connected with Rosetta's nebula, and it is constantly creating new stars -- 5,000 light-years away from Earth.
There's no dust in this brightly lit galaxy with a little black hole, just gas.
Researchers suggest that it occurred shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our views in the universe: critical telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgeem, even before Galileo began observing the stars a year later.
Since then, optical telescope mirrors have become more and more accessible, and their views of space have become ever deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in the Palomar Observatory under San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror depicted here had a diameter of five meters.
Arizona, U.S.A., has a "bigger binocular telescope".
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each 8.4 meters in diameter.
Gran Telescopyo Canarias has a giant internal device - the diameter of only a mirror is 10.4 metres.
South Africa's Greater South African Telescope mirror is segmented in order to reduce value.
However, it reaches approximately 11 meters in diameter.
Lack of low-cost design: the telescope is rigidly anchored under a vertical angle, which limits its movement.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its peculiarity: a high light-recognition capability.
It reaches -- despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror -- the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
With a radio telescope in Aresibo (Puerto Rico), researchers are listening to outer signals in space.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the "Search for an Extraterrestrial Mind" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing his computing capacity.
View at the Observatory of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
There's a very large telescope here, fully in line with its name.
Its four mirrors allow for even a medium infrared spectrum to be illuminated in the visual tube.
The Chilean ESO Observatory also plans to install a European “Large Telescope”.
Its main mirror shall be torn to a total of 42 metres and made up of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, photographs should not be expected before 2018.
Up to 2007, both Keck telescopes in the Hawaiian volcano Maun Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors ten metres in diameter.
Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also looks in the sky with Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope, with a mirror diameter of 30 meters, must appear on Mauna Kea.
Here they can enjoy the illustrations.
However, the most important species from outer space supply the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, he has been delivering paintings of faraway worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for planets outside the solar system, especially those on which life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 candidates had been detected since the start of the mission.
The photograph seals the latest preparations for the Kepler Space Telescope.
The Space Telescope of James Webba (JWST) will be dispatched to space not earlier than 2018 aboard the Arian 5 missile.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope's tasks is to search for the Big Bang in the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists suggest that there is ice on the southern pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data, as Messinger is moving closer to the north pole of the planet.
The radar measurements for decades indicated that Mercury had ice.
Thanks to the 2004 Messinger probe, the first one to rotate around Mercury, scientists are now confident.
Drink butter every day - and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach an honorable age.
There's even a museum of longevity here.
A search for understanding in a country where 97-year-olds still seem relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach an honorable age.
There's even a museum of longevity here.
A search for understanding in a country where 97-year-olds still seem relatively young.
Traveling through the Tallish Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
The microbus with its thunder is rolled down the steep road past the dense forests of hills, stormy rivers, and simple peasant houses.
Everything is so green and bright that you can think of yourself as being in Schwarzwald.
But this is the southernmost edge of Azerbaijan, and the Iranian border is only a few kilometres from here.
This is where the talismans live, one of the people of the Caucasus, who is known little, is only what they speak beautifully in farces and Azerbaijani and are distinguished by longevity.
The final point is Lerick.
The small town is immersed in the harsh architecture of Soviet times, which is completely out of harmony with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tiring.
It's 303 kilometers away for eight hours, because there's only one lane on the road.
The legendary wealth the country owes to the Caspian Sea oil is here in the province until it reaches its peak.
However, Pilate Fatulaeva (48) is convinced that there is something to interest tourists in Lerik.
"In May, Baku was celebrated by the Eurovideo Song Festival, and next year we will have the oldest people in the world," Fatulaeva said.
She's the director of the longevity museum, probably the only one in the world.
A biography of about eight dozen T-shirts from these places over 100 years of age has been documented.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
At 136 years of age, he had another child.
But the disputed star of the museum is Cheban Shirali Muslums, who was reportedly 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
In view of the fact that the oldest person whose age was confirmed was 122 years old, the age of Mussumov seemed extremely doubtful.
"He was born in the area in 1805, died in 1973," explains Fatulaeva.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, and at the age of 136, his daughter was allegedly born.
Did Cheban Muslamov add a couple of decades to his age?
Even Rembrandt Scholz, an adult researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostok, heard of the debtors in Central Asia.
“A striking number of people of advanced age can also be found in some parts of China, Japan or in the Hunz Valley in Pakistan”, said Scholtz, “there are also very old people living in Sardinia.”
However, due to the lack of documentation, scientific confirmation of age is not possible, as there were no civil registers.
Every day a glass of melted oil
Nevertheless, people in the area of Larica are strikingly often reaching Bible age.
There are now 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why are there so many debtors here in the south?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzade explains this to the special genes of the talisha.
On the contrary, the director of the Fatulaev Museum believes it's a food business.
The waistcoats love meat, bread and the most dairy products, many drink on a glass of warm oil every day. However, it is unlikely that such high-calorie diet can be healthy from a dietary point of view.
Or is it the case of the first-ever life that keeps people young? In Chenghemat, a small village near the town of Lerick, Rubab Mirzoev lives.
At 97 years of age, she was still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, typical of the Caucasus region as a whole.
She's sitting on the floor with a barrel of oil that she's not tired of skiing around.
Eight people live here under the same roof, including one of the sons and daughters of Mirzae, who have long had grandchildren.
There's also two babies jumping in the vicinity.
In the kitchen, guests make tea, which is served in typical pussies of an armoudo.
Mirzae's perfectly flat and strong white teeth, under the top plate she hides the long dark-haired hair that her son proudly exposes to us.
I've always had my hair milk, so they never fell out and kept the color.
"And I've never used shampoo," said Mirzaev.
A Monthly Retirement Sufficient to Live
She always ate only what grew up in her own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought food in a store in my entire life.
Then she tells of her husband, who served in the army.
The hardest was since the Second World War.
But it was better when Haydar Aliev's "beloved father" got off the wheel.
Propaganda doesn't often sound like an old woman.
However, the cult formed around the figure of the father of the nation, which ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows little of the boundaries.
He was in power until 2003 and then his son, Ilham, accepted the board of directors.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among Azerbaijani elderly people.
230 manats (about the same amount of euro) Mirzaeva receives monthly pensions, for local conditions it is an amount that can be well lived on.
And maybe Mirzaeva's long-old son is also right: "Old women in our culture have deep respect."
They live in a large family, loving, caring, and happy.
What's no reason to stay alive for as long as possible?
The word “right of man” is not in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo show a profound division of the country.
The future constitution, based on sharia, faced fierce opposition.
The Egyptian president didn't focus on paphos.
We have to create a transition.
"And his success lies with my responsibility to the people and to the god," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but especially to Christian dignitaries, liberals, enlightened Muslims and nonreligious Egyptians.
For all of them, who are still hopelessly divided in a bitter opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the religious state of the Nile at the mercy of the mighty Muslim brothers.
Mohammed Murcy, who almost apologized, said that he temporarily cut off the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court and expanded his competence to “save the revolution”.
But what really wants to save a 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate at South California University is not quite clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of power?
In fact, 234 articles were made available in a 15-hour night jumping with obstacles to an Islamist constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this is a cause for concern in part.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that judicial proceedings are based on “principles of Islamic law”.
But what does "principles" mean?
This has been and remains a matter of interpretation, and it may be feared that Islamists will use vague language and a legal luxuries to better interpret sharia.
At least one new article suggests this: in all Shariah cases, Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country that enjoys great authority in all Sunni Islam, should be brought to the Council.
This should not be necessary, but it may mean that the clergy are in charge of the law, which would result in de facto restricting the judiciary.
In the draft Constitution, much is the subject of interpretation
Another problem: the jurisdiction of civilians must remain with the military court.
These courts, during Mubarak ' s reign, served to suppress the opposition.
Following the overthrow of the dictator, there were up to 11,000 civilians in military detention.
As the draft states, the State must protect “the true nature of the Egyptian family” and “support its morals and values”.
Legally, this is so vague that government agencies can use this article to control even the content of film and literature.
By open text, this means nothing other than censorship.
No article directly establishes equality between men and women.
However, another prohibits insulting and insulting the prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is insulting and how it should be punished remains unclear.
It is also doubtful that the term “injury of human beings” is prohibited.
Is there enough cartoons about the president or jokes about the law?
The question of interpretation, as well as much in this project, which Murcy proposed for signature, and which he said would be submitted “very soon” to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The Revolution Is Back"
The opposition against the superiority of Islamists has been emerging for several weeks.
Tens of thousands of people met in an unusual unanimity in the evening on Fridays in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document even before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned, and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who ranked third in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed ElBaradei, stated that the draft constitution was a place of “history dump”.
Through his short news service, Twitter accused Murcy's supporters of wanting to lead the road against democracy.
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and take him down," said opposition leader Yasser Sayid.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been avenged”, the Egyptian media quoted the opposition policy of Khaled Ali as saying.
Many judges also indicated that they did not want to observe the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim brothers, in turn, called for a counter-demonstration, but, out of caution, not on Tahrir Square, but after a massive prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of the University of Cairo.
It was attended by a large number of women under cover and adherents of the Salafites who shouted: “The people demand the application of God’s law.”
They demanded from Murcy, "Clean the land," and assured them, "The Quran is our Constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic square on which it all began has provoked the state of almost civil war.
The Murcy followers obviously did not want to take that risk.
The Muslim brothers stated that the opponents and supporters of the draft constitution were both loud and clear.
Now is the time for the people to decide which direction the country should go in.
Most for the Islamic project, this is considered a case.
“The concept of “right of man” is never mentioned”
Hafiz Abu Saed was angry with this forced constitutional process, which was supposed to last until February with the participation of all the public forces.
A 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the Chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (ECR) protected the Muslim brothers when they were in prison or tried in Mubarak.
Not because he shared their vision, but because human rights were indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
Now, the words “human rights” never appear in the new constitution, and he regrets the talk with the “Welt am Sonntag”.
The expansion of Murcy's influence on all three branches of government in the State disappoints the lawyer.
These measures are clear strikes on the democratic rules of the game and lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening the civilian State, the President de facto annulled it”, said Saeda.
Democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels that everyone has abandoned him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could result in payment.
A protestor in Tahrir Square warns: "You create a monster that you cannot control."
Norwegian rafficking: the dumbest smelling fish in the world?
In the five million population of Norway, one of the highest standards of living is not only in Europe but also worldwide.
Perhaps the secret to the success of this country is somehow linked to the local addiction to one extremely vicious fisher?
Take some ripe cheese.
Put them in a bunch of dirty and sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You're going to get a frickin' smell of raccoons, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours away from Oslo.
It's beautiful, but in the air there's an irresistible characteristic smell.
Rakfisk is a trout planted with salt and drifted into water for a year, depending on which soul to reach.
As the slums cool down and cool down, the Norwegian crowds gather for a festival in Fagerne, devoted to the same thing, let's say, a breathtaking dish.
“She eats cheese and drinks a rumble of aquavit, a local thyme vodka”, explains Howard Halvarsen, a local firefighter in the profession and a “racfisc general” who runs the festival.
Everywhere around us, people eat fish sliced up with small pieces of fish and drink it with little portions of alcohol.
"Someone prefers aquavit than cancer," says Howard.
This drink can break the smell.
I'm trying some pieces.
If you can put a piece under your nose, it's not so bad, it's a little different from the portion of the land that you've been driving on the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from entirely different times, a time of poverty, when fish were maimed in hermetically closed water barrels before refrigerators were introduced.
Then, in the deep winter, when the fish had been well and thoroughly mutilated, it was extracted and used in the diet by deafening the perception of alcohol.
Even in the memory of the past generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate mainly to the United States.
Now, the population is growing rapidly, with more than 13 per cent being immigrants, who are being drawn to jobs, high wages and a developed social security system.
The people of Sweden (a long rival, and not so long ago a much more busy neighbor) come to work here.
Rakfiction is perceived as an important symbol, fixed and even a somewhat vicious element of the past Norway.
It's one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything is expensive -- a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you £9 (14 dollars).
Norway rarely appears in the world news, and most of the people in the country seem to be doing so.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name Anders Brayvik, a racist and right-wing extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the terrorist is referred to as “the one who happened on 22 July”.
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country, one of their fellow citizens has been able to commit such atrocities and killings.
Norway ' s current well-being is based on growth (from the beginning of the seventieth) of one of the largest oil-gas industries in the world.
“But oil is not the only reason for our prosperity,” says Anna, our waitress, who carries a tray of stamina, a woman with long, bright hair, and striking blue eyes, the embodiment of Nordic well-being.
We are such a nation, as you call it, reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English beautifully.
We don't like showing up, we're not bragging.
Norway deals very carefully with its oil - most of the revenues of the petroleum sector are invested in a special fund established for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when all the money they did not have collapsed, Norway carefully counted all the costs.
"As long as we can ride in skis in winter and walk in summer, that's enough for happiness," said Anna.
"And there's cancer," she adds with careless laughter.
I'm standing in the snow in line for some food -- cancer is enough for me.
Here's a salmon-meat hamburger, it's definitely an exotic, delicious juice meat.
But in the evening, we have even more of the same fish with the same breathless scent.
At my hotel, a special Racfiska dinner is held, during which visitors choose the best or perhaps the most fragrant fish.
There's a live television show that shows the lead in the baby tie, surrounded by raccoons and raccoons.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"So, Thor Jurgen, what was your assessment of the best fish in the mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our assessment."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Somebody's falling off a chair, maybe they've taken the aquavit.
Or maybe just smelling the fish.
Enrique Penja Nyeto, President of Mexico, will find it difficult to start a career.
While the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Penja Nyeto, is preparing to take office, correspondent BBC Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will have to face and the mixed expectations of his people.
Road traffic in Mexico City is now in a particularly deplorable state.
This city has been overburdened by transport and at a better time, and since Monday, steel barriers have been erected, cutting several key highways to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
This was not done, however, to prevent people from getting out of the suburbs, but to prevent protestors from reaching the Parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Penja Nyeto, will put on a presidential arm and take on the country's leadership.
A challenge is not easy for him.
Mexico had achieved good economic performance in the Felipe Calderon administration, which now had its powers, but the country had been in the war on drugs, which had already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
“My Government declares to the people of Mexico that it is ready to combat violence”, Mr. Penja Nyeto told President Baraku Obama of the United States of America earlier this week in the White House Oval Office.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Prior to such statements, Mr. Péña Nyeto's political career with the President of the United States had been promoted as governor of his native state of Mexico City.
In his home country, in a densely populated and vast state surrounding the capital of the country, the views on the new leader were divided.
A Righteous Man
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, it is remembered with warmth.
Residents are responsible for revitalizing tourism, developing the resort area and building infrastructure.
One of the new highways built by Mr. Penja Nyeto, which differs from roads with wells and pits previously built here.
Its names are displayed on a modern sports centre building and on an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We link with him the hopes of real and serious change”, said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a State Congressman from the Permanent Revolutionary Party (PRI), led by Penja Nyeto.
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that are so urgently needed by our country, especially in the areas of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous residence, the PRI party was pushed out in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence from the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, the party has placed great hopes on Enrique Penja Nyeto.
In addition, he refutes the charges of impunity that the new President has put forward of the opposition.
He is very upright and very committed to the realization of his vision of the future of the country.
He is an excellent public figure, and above all a man who can listen.
In another part of the state, however, many people have a different view of the former governor.
The municipality of Nessaualkoiotl, also known as Cudad Nessa, is the most striking contrast to the paved streets of Valle de Brave.
Hidden under highways, it is in many ways the suburbs of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also severe in this megapolis.
Earlier this year, troops were involved in drug-trafficking gangs in those areas; and violence against women was particularly acute here.
A few dozen bodies of murdered women have been found in the desert near a large landfill in just the last two years.
More than a thousand women were killed in Mexico City during the governorate of Péña Nyeto, far greater than that of the notorious violence in the city of Ciudad Juárez, whose name has become negative when it comes to killing innocent women.
According to the opponents, Mr. Péña Nyeto, he was best told that during his tenure as governor, he had failed to deal with the issue of killing women.
In the worst case, his administration was accused of completely ignoring the problem.
The resident of a concrete house, which resembles most houses in the surrounding area, Irenaeus Bundesa hardly restrains her tears by showing me pictures of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to Mariana's official version, she committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was killed by her cohabiter.
"When I got to her house, it looked like her body had been washed before," said Mrs. Bouendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the body was already hanging.
Mariana's mother tells this story, and the portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where he hangs next to the crucifix, on which only one word is drawn: justice.
That was what they said the family had been denied.
“The state officials treated me like an old scepter, a disgruntled peacebreaker.
They want people to just accept everything they say and to slow down.
But that is wrong, it is not possible, especially when there are so many violations and misdeeds around," she said.
On Saturday, the President, Péña Nyeto, will take on a difficult responsibility with her.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have committed violent crimes, and the new President has promised to make this problem a priority during his reign.
"I hope that he will be exactly the President as the Governor," said Olvera, Congressman from Valle de Bravo of the PRI party.
However, this is what the families of victims in Ciudad Ness are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning wasn't complaining about mistreatment, he's charging.
Prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning's allegations of poor conditions of detention.
The hearing focused on Manninga in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
Protection requires the closure of the case on the grounds that the conditions of detention of Manninga were cruel.
The U.S. Army has been charged with kidnapping several thousand classified documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who had been accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, had not availed himself of the opportunity to file a complaint about ill-treatment which he said had to be transferred to a military prison.
During a cross-examination hearing in Fort Mid, Maryland, the military prosecutor, Major Ashden Feyn, stated that the monthly visits to Manninga by the prison administration in Quantico, Virginia, in nine months did not contain complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination of Manning ' s defence motion for termination on the grounds that the conditions for his detention were severe and in itself sufficient punishment was carried out the day after Manning stated that he intended to commit suicide while in detention.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is charged with the abduction of several thousand classified documents during his service in Iraq.
This material was subsequently published on the Internet on WikiLeaks.
Resources WikiLeaks did not confirm that Manning was the source of information.
During the hearing on Friday, Prosecutor Feyn, together with Manning, reviewed the reports that had been filled out after Manning's visits by the Administration during his stay in Quantico Prison, where he was under strict detention conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
During their visits, the prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When prosecutor Feyn asked about the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he appreciated the treatment of prison administration as “excellent” and general conditions of detention as “very professionally organized”.
The reports considered did not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite the fact that Manninga had been directly questioned about the conditions of its detention, Feyn confirmed.
Manning replied that he had expressed his oral concern about these problems and that the officials who visited him had discussed these issues with him and had stated that they would be dealt with but did not record it in writing.
"They wrote down "there are no problems" (after the discussion of my complaints), but that does not mean that I did not raise this topic in conversation," Manning said.
A military judge, Colonel Deniz Linde, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his mistreatment in January 2011 during a commission meeting that considered the suicidal intentions he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting, he wanted to ensure that he was removed from the “Prevention of Trauma” regime and reduced conditions of detention.
The military leadership explained that the limited detention regime, lower than the surveillance regime to prevent suicide, had been introduced to protect the prisoner, as well as to protect others.
"I wanted to let the Administration know that I'm okay with them to cancel the trauma prevention regime... so that my standard of living would improve, from my point of view," Manning explained.
On Thursday, Manning testified to his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to prison at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had thoughts of suicide in Kuwait and that he had once lost consciousness because of the intense heat.
He explained that it was psychologically difficult when you were not allowed to know how you were involved and what was happening in the outside world.
"My world sank to Camp Arifjan base, to the size of my prison," Manning said Thursday.
- I thought I was going to die in this cage."
While in Quantico, Manning, he said, spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours a day -- in complete isolation.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only mattresses, blankets, slippers, some clothes and glasses.
He said that he tried to move because sleep or even lying down in the daytime prohibited rules.
According to Manninga, during his sleep, he always had a light entering the outside of the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he was turning into a bed at night, he said he was alarmed and forced to turn on his back.
Lawyer Manninga formally objected to Manning's mistreatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manninga was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge questioned Manning about the statement he made during his testimony on Thursday, that one night after he was forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners for the morning inspection.
Manning stated that he had not been able to cover himself with a blanket during the check-up.
Answering questions from a judge on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard's order that he should leave a blanket that he could cover, but admitted that no one had direct orders him to leave him.
On Thursday, Manning stated that the night before, he was forced to sleep naked because of his attempt to show the officer that he did not pose a risk to himself.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use underwear or slippers to traumatize himself, but he didn't.
That night, according to Manning's testimonial, his underwear, his slippers and his glasses were taken from the camera.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account what he had to survive during his detention and would significantly reduce his sentence if Manning was found guilty by a military court, which should begin his trial early next year.
The defence stated that it planned to invite Manning to plead guilty to less serious crimes and to challenge other charges as excessive.
The resumption of the hearings is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to insist that conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the detention of detainees with the strictest possible regime.
Among the charges put forward by Manning are aid to the enemy, the illegal promotion of the dissemination of data on the Internet, the transfer of information relating to national defence and the abduction of State property or documents.
If he is convicted of all charges, he may face life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of an American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of capacity to realize themselves.
The Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind the people of difficult times.
Ruben Navarrette believes that Mexicans of American origin are breaking up between two cultures.
During a recent visit to Mexico City, I traveled through the arrival corridor, approached the border control area, and stopped at the spot.
The signs indicated two rows: one for Mexicanos (Mexicons), the other for Extranjeros (for foreigners).
I've been standing in front of them for a few seconds, I don't know where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I've been called Mexican my whole life.
It's just a conditional name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and New York friends think they're Italian.
Later, I focused on the complex construction of "American of Mexican origin".
But this is where I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need for conditional names or complex structures.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask or answer questions.
But my vocabulary is poorer than the language bearers, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
That's why I got my American passport and got in line for Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Penja Nyeto, visited the White House and met President Obama.
The agenda was for the presidents of these countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Peña Nyeto was eager to talk about the rise of the Mexican economy, which would enable Mexicans to stay in Mexico with the same success instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to enter into a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and to set up a North American trade bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President Peña Nyeto promised to continue the war on drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a serious and old-fashioned issue.
Most Americans never thought that the United States had invaded Mexico in 1848 and had forced its leaders to abandon half of its territory under a rifle.
But the Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and they see reminders of those events in everything.
Therefore, it is only up to a U.S. public official to speak with a word of criticism towards Mexico, in the press and among the elite of Mexican society, and to complain that the Americans are violating the sovereignty of neighbours.
And the descendants of Montesumas are being carried out by war.
Mexico ' s relations with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States are the most complex.
Do you want to talk about insults?
That's enough.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people who find opportunities in this country, and those who do not.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican descent had only one reason: at some point in their family history, a father or grandfather was unable to realize himself in Mexico and had to go north.
Most of the time, they were Mexicans of a certain type -- snuggled, uneducated, poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember that.
That's not what they see in Mexico.
Today, our lives are the embodiment of the American dream, we've learned good schools and we've got a good job, but we don't forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confusing and unclear, but we know which country to consider our own.
United States of America.
In addition, we know that most Mexican elite and ruling class don't like us.
We respond to them in the same way.
They see in us a reminder of humiliating defeats and they treat us like people of the second class, like real Mexicans.
We do not speak properly in Spanish, and our relations with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence is due to failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We wouldn't be behind a silk curtain right now, finding a life in the United States, but losing our spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalahar and lawfully moved to the United States as a child, and it reminds me that there are some frictions between Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin - Mexicans understand their national identity more clearly, and Mexican Americans are offended.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes that she belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time, many of my famous Mexican Americans feel no part of any of them.
We're listening to the Los Tigres del Norte Mexican group, but we love Bruce Springstine.
By taking the best of two worlds, you inevitably lose roots.
We're Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, we're called Mexicans.
Now, as I learned during my visit, as if our relations were not sufficiently complicated, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals wanted to re-establish their relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work as ambassadors of Mexico and represent its interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how well it is to visit it, and we could persuade political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
It won't work.
Too much insult in the past.
And given the gap between the rich and the poor, corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not think the country is so beautiful.
I'm sorry, but deal with it yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States what they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will also have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans are still insulting the way their relatives were treated in Mexico most recently.
Yeah.
Maybe we have more in common than I thought.
Old battles in the new Middle East
The Ceasefire Agreement between Israel and the Hamas Group could be a fragile foundation for further peace
Is lasting peace possible between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion that such hopes are in vain.
It was the usual, senseless dispute over who had begun; many buildings were turned into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time during the conflict, rockets fired from the Gaza Strip fell in the vicinity of the capital city of Israel, Tel Aviv, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the hopeless integration of Israelis and Palestinians into their perpetual conflict, the Middle East has undergone changes.
This can be seen in different ways, but the events of the “Arab Spring” have surrounded many of the established realities in a rebellious storm, and the Palestinians with Israelis have not been able to stay away from the whirlwind that has shaken the region.
Perhaps as a result, their fight will become even more bloodthirsty than before.
However, there are reasons to hope that this deadly deadlock will emerge.
War Without Victory
At first glance, the situation does not give rise to optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on 21 November, was implemented, the clashes that took place this week only strengthened the positions of the forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamic Hamas movement, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will declare that they forced Israel to retreat despite their losses.
Despite the fact that some leaders of the factions have been destroyed and 1.7 million residents have been locked in one of the densest and most troubled parts of the world, Israel has not succeeded in destroying Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is increasing its popularity in the West Bank of the Jordan River, another Palestinian territory now controlled by the more moderate Fath movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time is working for them.
As Islamist movements in the Arab world grow, Hamas is seeing new powerful and wealthy friends.
The restored regional leader Turkey, once Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, expressed support for Hamas, followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic developing States of the Persian Gulf.
The solemn supporters of Hamas declare the establishment of an Islamic Crescent around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, in which the Hezbollah militia is ruling, to Syria, in which more and more pro-Islamic rebels are about to overthrow the power of Bashar Assad, and further to Jordan, where the king's authorities threaten Hamas allies.
The most significant change in the balance of forces in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arab country, Egypt, where President Mohammed Murcy was strengthened by the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement.
Hosni Mubarak, who had ruled Egypt for 30 years and had been overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who did not pay particular attention to the support of Hamas.
On the contrary, Muslim brothers are an organization much like Hamas, and their leaders are more inclined to populism.
In future diplomatic arrangements, Hamas may become a significant player whose voice cannot be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, the supporters of the hotline in Israel will come to the opposite conclusion.
In a military sense, Hamas was exposed.
The Israeli Iron Dome Missile System has justified the cost of its creation and has successfully destroyed many of Hamas 'launched missiles.
Israeli citizens can sleep peacefully for at least a while.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States remained faithful to its unwavering position; many European countries also blamed for the beginning of the last round of violence in Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially with the Government of Binjamin Netanyahu, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that some 30 Israelis had been killed since 2004, by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, Israel had been able to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly from the wall that enters the West Bank of the Jordan River, a significant part of the unrecognized Palestinian State, and protected Jewish settlements that continued to expand despite the illegality of such actions in international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose party, Likud, in preparation for the 22 January elections, was united with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Avigdor Lieberman, very convenient.
What is the point of making Palestinians and giving them their own state?
If they hand over all authority in the territory of the West Bank, will they not begin to launch rockets from there towards Israel, as did their gathering in the Gaza Strip?
It's better to keep them behind the wall and push them hard any attempt to raise their heads.
The supporters of the hotline may be defeated, but their calculations can be refuted by the Arab spring.
While Islamists who come to power in Egypt and elsewhere are not feeling the warmest of their feelings for Israel, domestic problems will be their priority.
The defence part of Israel's budget is greater than any of its Arab neighbours that have been taken together.
The dismantling of the war with the regional super-Power is unlikely to help Arab Governments strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of President Egypt, Murcy, who worked with Barak Obama on a ceasefire, is a good sign and can mark the beginning of change.
Israel should, to the minimum extent possible, take into account the long-term implications of its policies.
As democratic change unfolds in Arab countries, the denial of the right to self-determination of Palestinians constitutes a decelerating bomb that will sooner or later explode in the occupied territories of Israel, like a bus blown up in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining the foundations of democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic dimension, the growth of the Arab population, only exacerbates these problems.
The bloodthirsty operations carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement have to pay the growing discontent of the international community.
Both sides need an outside impulse
The only solution left is the continuous call of the healthy representatives on both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the formation of two States and the assignment of Israel to the security-for-security trade.
There remains hope, not too impressive in the short term, that the ceasefire will enable other countries to influence the parties to the conflict more effectively.
Egypt, which is a long-term decision to close arms transfers to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, have a more favourable position than ever to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish State adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile Hamas and Fath movements.
This would do more to create a Palestinian State than the upcoming UN vote, which could result in the recognition of the virtual state of Palestine.
President Obama must play a role in putting Israel at the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never presented his own peace settlement plan.
Upon his return to the White House, he continued to show a reluctance to join in addressing the problem.
It's a catastrophicly recent position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australia has enacted a unified cigarette package law.
Warnings about the damage to smoking and the image of affected parts of the body are contrasted with those given in the thin green boxes that are identical to those of all black cigarettes.
The first Australian law on the same type of cigarette and tobacco products has entered into force in the world practice, replacing the logos and colouring of different stamps with the same box of demented olive oil with the harsh pictures of the ill effects of body parts and images of children whose health is undermined by the smoking of their parents.
In addition to the various pictures and inscriptions that warn about the harm of smoking, the only difference between packs that have been imposed on this Saturday is the names of stamps that are printed in the same small type.
This is the most stringent world environment for packaging tobacco products.
The Australian Federal Government states that the aim of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, thus depriving them of the harmful habit of fashion status.
Such a decision was based on research that showed that people who did not start smoking before the age of 26 never become smokers in 99 cases out of 100.
“It is obvious that even at the young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to deliver by packing”, explains Minister of Health Tanja Plibersek, referring to studies showing that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with the idea of a princess for children.
Australia is one of the world's smallest smokers, so these changes will not have a significant impact on the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering the possibility of taking such measures.
The tobacco industry strongly opposed the enactment of this law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market where cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
“This law will lead to serious consequences other than those of its initiators”, says Scott McIntyre, a representative of British American Tobacco in Australia.
Forgery producers from China and Indonesia will supply much more such goods for sale in the streets of Australia.
For someone, by contrast, new laws promote business growth.
Sandra Ha, of the small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd, claims that the demand for Ports and Silicone Footwear, which hides unpleasant pictures on the package, has rapidly increased (practice from scratch) since two months ago by companies such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have lost their case in a high court in Australia where they have tried to appeal against this law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already implemented some 6,000 products to wholesale businesses and is awaiting a new party.
It's a good business for us.
The popularity of social networks among the parts of the population to which these measures are targeted is a potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures.
Following the adoption in Australia of a number of laws that have made illegal television advertisements and support for sports events, as well as prohibiting sellers from putting cigarettes in a prominent place, tobacco advertising has moved to the Internet.
The Australian Government had banned local companies and websites from posting advertising online, but it could not restrict foreign websites.
"If you trade tobacco products and you only have this little loophole, the idea of moving your goods on the Internet will prove very appealing," explains Becky Freeman, the following public health issues at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of trade marks reviews written by allegedly ordinary users on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises: Is it really the case of a private citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he has not regretted power and time and made a video clip, or is it the advertising company?
The Australia branch office of British American Tobacco argues that the industry is now more involved in adapting to new rules than advertising.
The tobacco industry has even taken measures such as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these States are submitting claims within the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade has been unfairly restricted, despite the fact that the trade relations of all these countries with Australia are very small.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tani Plibersek, the Government discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packing laws.
In 2001, Canada introduced the first mandatory placement of photographs to warn of the harm caused by smoking.
This rule has now been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is being considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
The number of smokers in Australia has not been shown to be reintroduced.
These pictures don't surprise me.
I'm just not paying attention.
"You just grab a cigarette and hide a package in your pocket," explains Victor El Haig, who buys cigarettes with a picture of the mouthpiece tumor on the package.
To be honest, the only thing that can make me leave is my little daughter.
James Yu, who runs the King of the Pack tobacco store in central Sydney, claims that the same package has complicated the task of placing goods on the shelf
"I've had an hour before, and now four hours," he complains.
"The government should have taken and completely banned cigarettes, and we would have said, "Well, what to do, all right, it's over, close the store," he said, throwing his hands up.
It's not so bad to miss electronic networks and permanent connections in the world.
I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport on Thanksgiving because our plane had mechanical problems and had been replaced by another plane we were waiting for.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.
I'm not going to lie to you.
The afternoon at the airport waiting for the flight is really boring, and there's no way of helping out with books, magazines, iPhones, or even duty-free stores.
More and more scientists and professionals in child development, however, have been promoting boredom.
They say that in certain situations it is not so bad for us and our children to miss.
This causes the brain to distract itself from interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in today's world all of us are constantly in front of some screen, the benefits of boredom pass by us.
Should we strive for boredom?
Yeah.
Not at the same time.
We'll get back to it.
I used to think, like many, that boredom was an invention of recent times when people had more free time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at Calgary University of Canada, author of the book The Attractive History of Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.
"In fact, boredom can boast a very ancient history," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii, Latin inscriptions on boredom dating back to the first century were found.
However, the question of how boring we understand remains open.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, associate professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom has often changed.
Having examined the research material on the subject and asked the task force a question of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came up with the following definition: boredom is when people “want, but cannot do what they will”.
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a boring person doesn't do anything he wants to do.
I don't want to do anything during my apathy.
Mainly in the boredom, he says, is “a disturbance of attention and the resulting deterioration of the mood and the feeling that time is running slow”.
It may seem very similar to depression, as described by the boredom.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible link between these conditions, people who miss see the causes of problems in the world and the circumstances, and people who experience depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we feel we're bored when it's really just hard for us to focus on something.
In his study, “Unmindful Mind: Determination of Grief From a Attention”, published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment, which participants listened to the recording of a voice reading the magazine.
Some participants also heard the loud sounds of the non-concerning television program in the next room, others heard the same sounds in low volume, so that they could hardly be understood, and the third group listened only to the recording of the voice without a foreign sound track.
Those who heard low - loud television said that they were bored, and more often than not, they found it difficult to concentrate, but they did not know why and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on difficult or exciting tasks, the interruption may be boring, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neurology at the University of Guelf, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, “for example, looking at the stream of goods on the conveyor in search of marriage, distracting music can help to avoid boredom”.
It is believed that it continues that when people start hanging on a chair or drawing caracles on a paper sheet, they do so from boredom, but now we know that such actions are really just helping not to relax physically.
“The study has shown that children who are not forbidden to climb and spin are better educated and remembered than children who are required to sit calmly,” says Professor Fenske.
At some point, we are all bored: if we delay the flight (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech by watching an uninteresting film.
However, different people show different degrees of boredom.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a special "student skeletal borehole" to measure such individual characteristics.
Questions and allegations such as “Many of what I have to do, uniformly and monotonously” or “I’m very interested, so I don’t have enough time”.
Using such questionnaires, researchers have identified boys as missing more girls, says Steven Vodanovic, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when there are various external irritants.
In general, however, adolescents often miss each other.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents every day.
The results were as follows: 32 per cent of adolescents said they were bored at school and during homework, and 23 per cent said they were bored outside the school.
At the same time, only 3% of the parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no record of what such boring data would be like now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “young age has a tendency to boredom,” mainly because children and adolescents are not fully able to decide what to do.
Return to my original question: boredom is useful?
Sometimes it does not, because in extreme manifestations it shows that research can push people into absurd and dangerous physical activities, risky gambling or abuse of certain substances in an attempt to get bored.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers thought about the relationship between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovic, who had devoted more than two decades to studying the problem.
"So our brain tells us we should do something else; that's boring," says Gary Markus, professor of psychology at New York University.
But this very brain doesn't always know what better to do.
If you're bored and you make this energy on a guitar or a culinary experience, you'll do better.
But if you watch TV, you'll be better off for a while, and it'll be over soon.
Therefore, if your child misses and you give him the iPad, he will cease to be bored, but he will not learn to deal with boredom alone or in any other way with his time and occupation, says Professor Fenske.
“And such self-regulatory skills are involved in a variety of situations”, he argues.
Your child learns more than self - control; he also learns self - control at all.
I don't think boredom has to be exaggerated.
But it's not worth considering as bad either.
Rather, we should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"We see it this way that we need to be bored more often, although boredom is an extremely unpleasant, insatiable desire to do something meaningful," he said.
In fact, people are trying to get away from the constant anxieties and just relax.
"In today's world, we're used to constantly over-stimulating the senses," he says, "and when silence comes, we're lost and we don't know what to do."
It is not clear how the new law on legalization of marijuana in Colorado will apply
Anthony Orosco, a 19-year-old football team player and a community college student in the south-east of Colorado, charged with a criminal offence that would soon be perfectly legal throughout the state: the storage of a small portion of the marijuana and pipe in which he smoked her.
Mr. Orosco said that one day in September he and his friends were in Lamar and driving in a prairie car near the border with Kansas when the police stopped them.
Following a police officer ' s discovery of marijuana in his car, Mr. Orosco came to the court for possession of drugs and possession of drug use devices, minor offences for which a $100 fine was due and the date of the trial was set.
"They treat us like criminals," said Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has persisted several weeks after Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small court cases depends not only on the law but on the place of the hearing.
Charges of minor marijuana-related offences have already been dropped in hundreds of cases here and in Washington, D.C., which has taken a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped bringing charges against people aged 21 years and older for keeping small doses, which will be considered legal once the law enters into force in a few weeks.
However, in more conservative districts of Colorado, prosecutors decided to deal with existing marijuana cases and continued to hold the drug responsible.
At the same time, in some cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the West, there is a vote against the emergence in their places of new, licensed state stores for the sale of marijuana.
"All of this is moving so fast that I don't even know what to wait for anymore," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
Supervisors in Washington State will also honor their heads.
They have to establish rules to determine how to license the production, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all of this needs to be done by 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, good or bad, is ahead of most other states to deal with marijuana, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
“A more orderly market in Colorado, so they will serve as a good example”, explains Brian I. Smith, representative of the Council for the Control of the Production and Marketing of Alcohol in Washington State.
But now no one can do more, acknowledges Mr. Smith than to make some proposals and hope that this will work.
"We don't have a real precedent to focus on," he said.
The Washington State Bill, titled I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will put the state into a state of uncertainty for a year when there is no State licensing system, and the right to own marijuana has been legalized.
There are still complex technical aspects that need to be addressed during this period, for example, how to strike a balance between the state's "adequate access" to licensed marijuana, with a ban on trading 1,000 feet away from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
“It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana businesses in the city line, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs”, explains Ben Livingstone, a representative of the newly established research group “Centre for Legalization of the Marihuana”.
On 21 November, Chief of Police Oates of Aurora sent an e-mail message to his subordinates that the City Prosecutor's Office would no longer involve persons under the age of 21 to be held responsible for the possession of a small number of marijuana and that the police would cease to identify people in the violations “from this point on”.
The Chief of Police, Oates, reported that the police would monitor compliance in the city with regulations governing the medical activities of marijuana-producing persons and would prosecute illegal traffickers and drug traffickers.
The U.S. Attorney of the Wald District, in northern Colorado, Ken Bak, presents a more stringent approach to this issue.
After voting on the bill, he stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office would continue to hold marijuana ownership responsible, mainly to encourage its users to undergo treatment.
At present, 119 individuals are charged with holding two or less ounces of marijuana, although many of them are accused of other violations.
“The duty of our institution is to prosecute acts considered criminal at the time of their commission”, said Mr. Bak in his statement.
The reaction was mixed even in places such as the Mesa rural district, where voters rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
The Grand Jankshn Police, the largest city in the county, no longer holds adults responsible for possession of a small amount of drugs.
District Attorney Pete Hautsinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop charges on open cases of marijuana storage.
"I believe that ensuring compliance with the law until it is changed is our direct responsibility," he said.
Although 55 per cent of the population of Colorado voted in favour of this decision, the inclusion of marijuana for entertainment in the public and legal system will not be easy.
Contradicting the reaction of residents in various locations in the state has exposed the ambiguity of the attitude of the local authorities towards the state experiment with marijuana.
“The District Prosecutors have a cultural barrier in this regard”, explains Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing the interests of the condemned for possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of Laws on the Marihouan.
“They have persecuted people for so long that they cannot really accept that they are no longer a crime,” he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first states in which a small number of marijuanas are treated in the same way as alcohol -- are meant to be a pilot country-wide to test the very idea of drug legalization.
Legalists and state officials plan to expand the area of legitimate trade, but at the same time they look forward to receiving orders from the federal authorities that continue to plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The legalization of marijuana is hoped that the Office of Justice will address this issue.
In spite of several large-scale arrests of traffickers and patients using medical marijuana, the Federal Government has in most cases been good at selling marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
The Anti-Drug Bureau agents are unlikely to break into the house to confiscate a small package of marijuana, but they are unlikely to close their eyes on the state-controlled recreational marijuana stores that are permitted under the new law, says Kevin A. Sabeth, a former counter-narcotics adviser to Obama's administration.
Some cities in Colorado have not waited for federal authorities to act.
Prior to the presidential elections, some local administrations approved a moratorium on the opening of new marijuana stores that would never have opened before a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a town in the western part of the state, issued a six-month ban on the trade in marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in a position to license anyone, and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still many outstanding issues left.
Petronella Whitet, I got out of Oxford for being a conservator.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
As long as I can remember, I always dreamed of going to Oxford.
My father and older brother studied in Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, a modern analogy to the ancient symposium, which lays the two foundations of civilization, freedom and tolerance.
And yet, two weeks later, at the University of Oxford University History School at the end of the eighties, I collected the suitcases and left, which was the first real scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand it and cried.
Friends were so confused.
The Evening Standard said I quit college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I had left because I had to drink out of the gravel cups.
Actually, it wasn't that much fun.
I ran away.
Yes, she escaped because I was systematically poisoned and intimidated.
Not at all because of my pretty unusual name or what I went to private school.
I was grassed for only one reason, and in this glorious cradle of enlightenment, it looked like a true barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a well-known adviser to Margaret Tetcher, and I myself was a supporter of the conservatives.
You ask, why mention it now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students with rights-based views is subjected to the same kind of grass.
This institutionalized and constantly growing hatred of conservative students in Oxford was so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as those accorded to persons with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the Cambridge College College Corps of Cristy stated that they were “often isolated, subjected to personal attacks and made to feel unwanted” because of their political views.
They wish to introduce an additional representative to the Committee on the Equal Rights of the College in order to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was only aggravated by the recent BBC 2 documentary film on student politics, “ Wonderland: Young, Smart and Right”, in which conservatives were presented by eccentricists and neo-Nazis.
Joe Cook, former president of the Association of Conservatives of Oxford University, who rides the Rolls Road, wears a silver suit and cane with a silver necklace.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they make “goats of leave due to higher school fees”.
Luke Black, 20, Vice President of the Conservatives Association of Nottingham University, interviewed one of the Sunday newspapers, saying that “in the university environment, there is an increase in left-wing bias.
People who don't even know us think of us in advance as naked and unpunished children of rich parents."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student at the History Department of the Corps of Christy College, who applied for increased protection, called such an atmosphere “insoluble” and Stephanie Cheryl, 19, the new president of the Association of Conservatives of Oxford University, said that the attitude of student club members towards the right-centred people had deteriorated considerably.
“It is a threat both to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and to the normal lives of the members of the club”, she said.
The first few weeks at Oxford I wasn't just a minority, I was alone.
I got there in September 1986, a slave and a captive 18 - year - old girl.
Oxford fevered from hatred to conservative party.
A year earlier, Marguerite Tetcher, a former student, was voted off by the university, due to a reduction in the budget allocation for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even the Stalinists would be uncomfortable.
In the first days of the first week of the first year, when the students met each other and the teachers, I felt for the first time that I had been waiting for me.
I did not yet know that the teachers not only looked through their fingers at the grasses of the conservative students, but they were also pleased to participate.
Political issues - the strike of miners, the privatization and opposition of the Government to impose sanctions against the Government of Apartheid in South Africa - penetrated through wooden panels of the walls of the auditorium.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said the teacher, now Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
I've had a hard time getting text, and I'm stuck.
Harry Pitt was a very greedy man with a face like a cake.
"Doesn't dancers learn French at all or are they just short of brains?" he asked.
Other students hesitated.
I had tears in my eyes.
"You're supposed to take a few initial French lessons in your spare time, if you're certainly not very busy going around in society," said Pete.
I'm back in my room completely unhappy.
That night at college, I was sitting at lunch alone, and then someone grabbed my shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student from the English Faculty, who was introduced as a member of the Association of Conservatives of the University.
"I know who you are," he said friendlyly.
Unfortunately, the case is as follows:
Anyone suspected of being sympathetic to conservatives will be bullied.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna make it harder for you.
Most of the first-year-old conservatives pretend to be lobbyists."
Later, at the local pub, I was anxious to be hypocritical.
I insisted that I disagree with everything Margaret Tetcher says.
The trick didn't work.
A freshman at the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who himself studied in Iton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious."
Other students took his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
"How are the Conservatives doing sex?
- They're beating each other up, aren't they?
I felt as if I must have felt homosexual prior to the abolition of criminal prosecution in the 1960s.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet the like-minded only under cover of night?
Would I have to become a Labourer and hide my true beliefs?
For three years I began to feel like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who didn't hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for being part of the Conservators but also for being an adviser to Tetcher on foreign policy and one of her conspirators.
He almost didn't show up at college.
He despised him for his provinciality, gentleness and commitment to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997, he took up a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started driving to Oxford from my parents’ home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unbiased capital friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the fortieth years, there were political views.
"But it's the best university in the world," he said in mourning.
- They can't do that. They're not in the city of sleeping pills.
Even my Communist friends have always behaved perfectly."
His wet eyes were muffled.
"Don't make any hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you drop out of school."
I was tired of permanent trips to London and my emotional protection was weak.
My friend, also a Conservator, did not stand the pressure and gave up his beliefs.
The next week during the seminar, when another history teacher called me “the enemy of the people”, I decided to do the same.
In a spirit of shame, I admitted that I had been brainwashed by my parents and called them "old fools."
It's been a while.
The last nail in my career's grave at Oxford was meant to kill my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns each week for Rupert Murdock’s publications.
My door was locked.
I didn't go out, and five minutes later my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I picked up the suitcase and sat on the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a stick and a stick.
But in eighteen years, no one should be subjected to such malice and intimidation in a school institution.
The saddest thing is that it was Oxford, who not only released fourteen Prime Ministers but still hides behind the undeserved reputation of the university in which they value equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers the elegance of glory."
On the exhibit "Valentino: Master of Shia" opened this week in London, ABC talks with Nati Abascal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemica and other famous customers of the Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of receiving an exhibition about Valentino Garavana.
The designer acknowledged this at the opening of Valentino: the Shia Master, a triumphal retrospective exhibition that combines over 130 high- fashion plates created by his home for the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is "Il Signora Garavani", but it could not have been written without his named clients.
Valentino has always felt charmed by the rare and distant world.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which was opened before 3 March, there were many personal letters and photographs signed by the most prominent aristocrats, from Princess Salima Agha Khan to Lord Snowon, including Marie Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social recovery: from a modest porter from the town of Voger in northern Italy to the best of the international elite.
Being in love with the royal court is not a bad thing.
"At least they don't put out their cigars about your magnificent cover, as some beautiful pop-music stars do," says Fiona Tissen-Bornemica.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an impotent host and accepts guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to come to his scarf in Gstaad," explains Haini Tissen's ex-wife, a close friend of forgotten beauties, such as Marella Annelly or Eugenia Niarhos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of glory.
And yet, he's a star.
Valery Maset representing Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Maćé recalls the charismatic model.
One day we went to his house to eat dinner, which was after showing fashion at the square of Spain in Rome many years ago.
Among the 20 invited were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, Jr.
The Valentine's style showed up in everything, in every detail of his apartment, in her clothing, in food, in music.
“Each of the guests of Valentino was allowed to feel important and loved”, recalls the “top model” whose work with the model began in 1995 during the High Fashion Week in Paris.
"He's never out of style, because his sketches are real works of art," she concludes.
Breeding Parade
Garavani's life is not a history of obsession, it's love with total reciprocity.
He loves people with good upbringing and high titles, and they love him.
One of Somerset House's galleries was transformed into a glamour podium of 60 meters in length, which offers a change of roles: the visitor takes a place of models and has to defilate by the podium, the gazelle of the gazelle from the beams that gleam with the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Witti used in Nights, or the coat of wool and leather that belonged to the Empress Fara Dib.
In this publication, the models highlight such names as Sibylla Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn und Thaksis, Matte-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Gabsburg.
Nati Abaskal and Modelling, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentine's Day is like the first love, "it's impossible to forget".
I remember him beautifully.
It was pants, shirt, vest and jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"That was the gift he gave me," says Nathi Abaskal, one of the designer's museums.
“I prefer the rest of him for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty”, adds the former Duchess de Ferria.
I really like the color he uses: they have a lot of light and they "come" to his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion legislator Patricia della Joampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she went to Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I would have the age and reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
Finally, the time came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to put it on a holiday in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a coat of strips, a corrugation in a bag and a cut of no bras.
"It was a dream that became a phenomenon," said the widow Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is extraordinary," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her holiday dresses from a model with "maximum caution... because dress is not just a dress, it is also a set of memories accompanying it."
"The King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the show in Somerset House is Marie-Santall Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (what is called the model of its stitches) to make this shell of ivory with the infracture of pearls, twelve species of different circles and a plume of four and a half metres.
According to journalist Suzy Menquez, the greatest authority of the specialized press, dress is the height of the high fashion of the late 20th century, “return of clients from the highest light”.
A fooled for many years, the “style of life” of the elite, now Valentino is himself the best representative of the elite.
The Grand Cross Cavalry (a sign of the highest rank in Italy), the Labour Cavalry, the Order of Arts and Words, awarded by the Order of the Honourable Legion, Garavani collected the same honors as any of the spouses of his clients.
"My attention has always attracted his subtlety, his serenity, his neat and impeccable appearance," recalls D'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at an festive dinner at the Orsa Museum.
He was sitting at a table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was useless, there's no time for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The world's hardest profession: miners from Kawah-Igen
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk life and health by placing 70 kilograms of sulphur on the top of the volcano on steep stone trophies
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them, Anto Vijayya, one of the 400 miners who earn a living for sulphur mining in the Kawah-Jijen volcano, located in the east Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Anto descends to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphur gas rising from the depths of the earth is blocked by contact with the air.
He puts them in two bamboo baskets, lifts baskets on his shoulders, and carries them upstairs on an indestructible stone road.
Before the top of the volcano, which is 2,386 metres high, it is only 250 metres, but it takes more than 40 minutes for capable trucks to step up, with difficulty holding the balance and carefully paving the road so that they do not fall and fall from the breakout.
They know that one wrong step can cost them their lives, as it did with a French tourist who broke up a few years ago with the Kawah-Jien Rock.
Kawah-Jjeen chessters earn 5 euros for each kilogram of cheese they earn
At the top, they pave the way for tourists who take pictures of them, as if they were monkeys from the circus, who were tired of carrying heavy baskets, walked three kilometres to the weights that the mining company had placed a little higher, at a height of 1,850 meters.
It is a PT Kandi Ngrimbi, an enterprise that has been operating this volcano since 1960 and, better yet, not to say, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocents) to petroleum production, since this mineral is distributed in everyday life and is used to produce matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"Since the standard is 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) per walk," Anto explains to us, who usually performs three daily transports.
He spends three hours on each of them and at the end of the day feeling broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (EUR 11.5) by the end of the day.
Although this seems a waste of human effort, it is three times as much as he would earn in the field.
“The daily wage for miners is very high at local rates, where 15,000 rupees (€1.2) a day and average monthly earnings are equal to two million rupees (€167)”, explains the truck who used to work as a stoner on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the plot was not as heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banjuwangi, a town not far from the volcano, for a reason which in Indonesia is as devastating as the cheese: “I married a girl with Bali, where some Hindus were brought to Java to accept Islam.”
Anto's asthma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and he's got toxic gas on his eyes.
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years at risk in Kawah-Igen, whose cheese had already begun to affect him despite the presence of masks and special glasses.
He's got asthma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and he's got eyes coming down from toxic gases that volcanoes.
It's the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
"I'll work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
A person punished with life, a pleasant and clever young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter, or a port at a hotel, but instead he does a mule’s job.
For a dirty wooden hut with other stretchers, it rises every day at two o'clock in the night, because the sulphur never ceases to flow at night when its distinctive yellow colour turns into blue and shines in the midst of darkness.
Throwing a challenge to the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, covering his way with a little lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought on his own money.
About 400 carriers carry baskets of cheese on their hands from the bottom of a volcano
Despite high profits, the mining company did not mechanize the production of sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers operating on their own account and with such deprivations.
In fact, they do not receive even a portion of the 30,000 rupees (€2.5) of the photo survey fee, which, along with an entrance ticket of 15,000 rupees (€1.2), the guards of this reserve collect from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its mullah people.
"This is a job for cattle, not for humans," says Badrusin, a 42-year-old root carrier who has spent three decades in Kawah-Jijen since he left college.
A capable raise of 110 kg, he assures that he will tolerate the work “as much as he can” because he needs money to educate his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not gonna retire, I'm gonna die here, because volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulphur burns the throat and burns the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so debilitating that no one complains of their severe diseases... more serious, apparently than their usual breathing problems, arthruses, knee pains and shoulder ulcers, which have deformed under the weight of their baskets.
By balancing the basket on the back, Uninik can now only raise 50 kilograms in his 53 years.
Each day he and his companions carry 15 tons of sulphur from a volcano, which three trucks carry to a warehouse in Tamansari, crossing a distance of 18 kilometres along a narrow path among the adults.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Uninik, opening his mouth wide, with few teeth missing.
Of his five children, older than 30, he also works as a serial carrier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the worst occupations in the world: what human mules from Kawah-Jien do.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporean people blame careers, stress and housing and education prices for the lack of children.
The population of Singapore must grow.
I'm a patriot's husband, you're my patriot's wife, we'll do our civil duty and create life!
It may seem amazing that these lines are part of a batting label commercial, but despite it - or possibly because of it - this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local proverbs like "Let's put bao in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's fertility level.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, hopes that they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun way by advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said that he wanted to use the power of music to make people do their national duty.
This thing was exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is a major problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt that it was the subject that we should address.
We knew that the Government had tried to do much, for example, to launch ghosts with pheromones or to organize fast dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we make the most creative thing out of the possibilities to solve this problem, namely, rap?
1.2 children
Those who do not take this lightly are the Government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The State package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has a low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city State in South-East Asia, also known for its leadership and its strict public control.
Singapore has a fertility rate of 1.2 children per woman, according to its National Population Office.
The last time it was below 2 - what is known as the percentage of replacement - in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeers have more children?
Tan Wei Min, Director of the Policy Office for Spouse Couples and Families of the National Population Authority, said that the reason for “improved education” and “the wider range of career opportunities”.
“This has enabled people to have a broader range of options in terms of life's goals and priorities than marriage and family creation”, she explains.
These social changes contribute to the increase in the number of bachelors and the postponement of marriages and the birth of children, which has reduced the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policies, which aim to dramatically increase immigration to counter the decline of the population, are offensive to the local population.
Singapore has websites that thrive on barely hidden xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese people, who are criticized for low wages and unwilling to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons that the ruling Singapore Party has had the worst results in elections since independence.
After the elections, an attempt was made to resolve the problem, with quotas and higher taxes on foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in fertility has a known impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, medical spending and immigration policies, the example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government is making efforts not to build so much small housing.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The Urban Development Manual has become a control over the number of small apartments known as a shoe box that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments are sold very well at 46 square metres.
Nevertheless, there is a view that they can contribute to a holistic lifestyle and discourage the incentives of builders who want to build large family housing.
But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of the EL Developers household firm, says their shoe boxes are sold much faster than more spacious copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are bought for a few days, even weeks, faster than bigger apartments.
As a result, our cash income has increased.
Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the new rules gave clearer guidance to the builders who had previously been confronted if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Overheated
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to Singaporeers working in the financial district of the centre, they do not seem to have any special effect.
“People are very tense, housing is expensive, as is education, and that is why many people postpone it”, says the young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But it is important for me to have my own money and time," said another young man for 20 years.
Men and women refer to their careers, stress and housing and education prices as reasons for preventing them from having children.
So, no matter how the Government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, as far as the birth is concerned, Singapore remains the last word.
Offline Personal - Online Personal
Confidentiality.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Academy of Spanish, it is a property of private or “personal life that is entitled to protect against any interference”.
What is personal for a minor under 16 years of age?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and in social networks?
Does he understand the dangers faced in discussing situations on the Internet that would certainly not be shared outside the Internet?
ElPeriodico interviewed five children from 10 to 15 years of age, often using the network.
In four cases they associated the term with “something very mine”, in a personal plane, and“ password and username” when they applied it to social networks.
"My biggest secrets I wouldn't have put in my post," says ten-year-old Jorge, when he tries to explain personal meaning on such sites as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he's had recorded records for two years.
"It's a very secret secret, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he claims.
On FB I download beautiful pictures or pictures from games.
I'm also having fun with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photograph that wasn't mine, or someone who behaved stupidly," he said.
The boy realizes that it is wrong to publish inappropriate pictures of exposed people, crimes, or to write insulting or angry comments.
Jorge assures us that he knows 35 friends he has at FB and nine of his florists on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Mother knows she has a password for one of the records.
I took Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they're responding to me, I'm just loading them," he adds.
"Social networking is fun, I can talk to distant relatives or with my friends as soon as possible," he says.
Without thinking about it, he answers that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I wouldn't treat someone who would recommend him to a stranger.
The 14-year-old Jose case is different.
This teenager has open records on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the latter he admits that he does not know 20 people added to his list of friends.
"That doesn't scare me because we have something in common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one trusted him or asked for his home address or phone number.
"If they pressure me or demand me, I'll just remove them from my records," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experience of what is known today as cybermobing.
A friend of mine was blackmailed on a social networking site.
He was threatened and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assured me.
According to José, the victim did not delete the record.
"Only included confidentiality."
He then explains the sequence of steps to adjust the recording in a safe way.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would download photos of people who are familiar with uncomfortable or confused situations.
Yeah, I would if I didn't like a man or if I wanted to.
"Although I know it's cyberbing," he confirms.
Key issues
Marjelos Porras, an English teacher and an education and training specialist, believes that to guide children and adolescents, the purpose of social networks is to be informed.
“The internet appeared as a search engine, but with the emergence of these sites, the rules of the game have changed”, she noted.
Porras points out that academic Mark Prenski, master of education at Yale University and author of work, Digital Aboriginals and immigrants, has developed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aborigines are them, children and young people born in the age of technology.
"We are digital immigrants who have to teach them while we are still learning ourselves," she said.
It explains that this topic is complicated, “because we ask them to have a certain criterion for what can or cannot be distributed, published or spoken, at a age when maturity is not enough for it.”
"So that they are selective, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends, without considering the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to show that children and adolescents have such confidentiality is to ask questions that make them think.
"To tell them not to do so is useless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some of the options: there are some things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or would you like it if you were photographed like the one you published about your friend?
Do you know that others are publishing about you?
When you sign pictures of the party, do you ask other people for permission to celebrate them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to let them know that they have to act online as they do on offline.
The rules are the same.
“A person out of the Internet behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, and must also be on social networks”, she said.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a professor of primary education and an education consultant explains the need for family heads to read social networking policies in good faith.
Each of the paragraphs understands that they have good grounds for talking to children about the prerequisites for the opening of an online accounting record.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published," he said.
According to Gourdija, the key question is to remind children of the lesson "Don't talk to strangers".
UNASUR Summit ends without the Lima Declaration being promulgated
The Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, previously declared and theoretically signed by the family as binding participants.
Efe has repeatedly sought access to the document signed at the VIs of the next UNASUR Heads of State and Government meeting, but sources from the Office and the President ' s Administration have indicated on the main page that it will be transmitted after the closure, but have subsequently confirmed that it will be published on the Peruvian Government ' s website at some point.
On questions about the text, they indicated that the contents were presented by the President of Peru, Olyant Umala, during short press statements.
Journalists' access to information on the Summit was always limited.
During the day it was only broadcast, in the press room, the video of the presidential assembly without sound, with the message "closed meeting, sound prohibited".
Few of the information circulating among reporters was transmitted by the press secretary of some UNASUR Governments attending the meeting, but not by Peru.
The only document distributed during the day was a list of participating presidents, causing the dissatisfaction of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more information.
Subsequently, the Government of the President of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but it is a statement by Umala rather than an official document that concluded the summit.
In the past October, Peru hosted the III South American and Arab Summit (ASPA), and in spite of the insistence of the press, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been proclaimed, had not been circulated.
On the official ASPA website, it can be verified that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to ensure that transmission systems were provided for all journalists, but limited information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint decision of Chile and Peru to adopt the verdict of the Hague Court, which regulates the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Olianta Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Piner, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they would abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice, which begins hearing statements by both parties on Monday in The Hague, as part of the indictment that Lima filed against Santiago.
“We will respect and implement a decision that will clarify the differences that we currently represent in this international court”, said Umala, near his Chilean colleague.
“Chile was, and will be, a country respecting international law, a peaceful settlement of differences, pacts and international tribunals”, added Pinier, and welcomed Umalu's hand in the face of the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by the two Presidents of their submission to the International Court of Justice was immediately after Colombia protested this week by the Bogotá Pact, according to which it acknowledged that the verdicts of this international court were subject to a decision on the maritime boundaries of Nicaragua, which it found to be wrong.
The summit was held in the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rusef; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Kristina Kirschner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR had been suspended since 2011, following the impeachment of his former President Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the meeting.
The President-in-Office, Olyant Umala, was responsible for opening the debate in the morning and closing the summit, a little later in the afternoon of Lima.
The Head of State read a final document stating that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 projects had been approved among South American countries, with an estimated investment of $17 billion.
Among the agreements that had been adopted, he mentioned that the countries of UNASUR would take “important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the residence arrangements”.
He said that action was being taken to improve “cooperation against the insecurity of citizens and organized transnational crime, to increase the availability of drugs, low-cost Internet access in all corners of South America and to take into account the cumulative and effective risks of natural disasters”.
Since Europe is in crisis, “economic integration (Latin America) should not have a triumphal basis, but should serve to expand our productive framework and provide a better future for our cities”, said Umala.
"We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31 sign projects that will improve the relationship between the South American space, especially in the village and border areas... by bringing our countries together and forming new economic schemes," said the Peruvian President in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were in Peru and were limited to transverse axes in its territory, from coastline to Brazil, and two were aimed at a great deal of communication with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The outcome document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to rejoin the Union of South American Nations, from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, to be united, and to have good relations among neighbours was another theme highlighted at the summit.
In that sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before taking part in a regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortegay, on Saturday in Mexico City, to negotiate in a respectful manner on the maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of an international court challenged by Bogotá.
"Sunday, I may meet President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
“We will review all these ways, they are not mutually exclusive, including the Nicaragua Pact, will require discussion with Nicaragua”, he stressed.
“With President Ortega, I hope to be able to tell him that we will deal with this as civilized and respectfully as possible”, Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they have a new President, Enrique Penja Nyeto.
Also within the framework of the 2013 summit, the defence ministers of the bloc met in advance for the adoption of the Action Plan, aimed at strengthening dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the latter has been suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
“South America must learn from Europe on the question of citizenship integration”: Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the establishment of a common citizenship is the goal of "South America, in this case, yes, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, stated to Peru that the Europeans had “killed each other during the Second World War” and in other clashes, “but now they are almost one country”.
It protected, in this context, a project for the establishment of South American citizenship, which was endorsed by UNASUR countries.
“There is a need to secure the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactive sectors that want to bring us back to the past”, he warned.
The Ecuadorian President has also shown himself to support the relaunch of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the pretext of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who have signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who read lectures never take on any obligations, and we South American people, on the contrary, sign everything.
“It is not clear that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington, D.C. and financed by the United States,” he said, hinting at political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assangu.
Correa assured him that he did not regret the decision because he did not betray his principles, but respected his “deep values of democracy and human rights”.
He added that in his day “there were certain suspicions that Assang would be extradited to a third country and that the process would not be followed”.
He also criticized Swedish justice for requiring access to his territory for questioning the alleged sexual offence, while “only Swedish legislation considers it possible to implement it through a videoconference that could be made from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London”.
Correa confirmed that there was a risk of deteriorating physical and mental health of Assang.
"I haven't spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the Ambassador has told me that he has had a slight legal problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of state.
What is really there is a risk of deterioration of his physical and mental health due to incarceration in a small space without the possibility of exercising in the air.
"It affects the health of every person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum problem granted to Assanju since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London by providing a guarantee of inviolability that would enable him to go to Ecuador was in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judiciary, and stressed that there had been negotiations in London to find a solution to the detention problem of WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judiciary, because counsel Assanja, Baltasar Garson, conducts a number of processes in various European bodies”, he said.
He suggested that “if Britain grants a guarantee of inviolability tomorrow, it will end”.
And if Sweden, as her legislation is perfectly capable of, and as she has done in other cases, interrogates Señor Assanja at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or interrogates him about Skype, the problem will be exhausted tomorrow.
Correa took the opportunity to show herself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that she did not tolerate “indirectness, bad faith and lies that distort freedom of expression”.
“The chief enemies of freedom of the press are not corrupt political villains, but bad journalists supporting life, blackmail and extortion”, he said.
In this respect, he was pleased that neither these journalists, “neither bankers nor bourgeois hegemony countries are in Ecuador” and added that, as re-elected, “resolve the revolution to continue development in the right direction”.
Correa also supported the decision to preserve Paraguay's veto in UNASUR at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization “should not be firm and should not tolerate opportunism and support the coup d'états under the rule of law” because in reality, “it has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy”.
The Ecuadorian President also considered the “extensive” wish of his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries following the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which was in favour of Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At present, this decision has not been complied with.
This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
We need to process them together in order to overcome them and move forward.
He also expressed his hope for a good conclusion of the maritime border dispute in the same Court of Peru and Chile, and said that it was “right for Latin America to appeal to international authorities if two countries committed themselves to making a decision no matter how difficult it may be”.
With regard to the opportunity to stand as a candidate for the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador in order to run for a third consecutive term, he indicated that he considered the possibility “with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is rather difficult”.
Correa assured her that if she had lost the election in February 2013, she would leave public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in such unjust situations as Ecuador, social and economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement felt that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so that I had to recognize this responsibility,” he said.
In the event of a victory, this would be my last term as President, and then we're out of public life.
If we lose, it's the same thing.
"That's the solution," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he had gone to treatment that had already been scheduled, routinely, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean the deterioration of President Chávez's health," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian State took part in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
Mortality from AIDS today is the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was told that his AIDS analysis had been positive.
"I feel like I've been muffled," he remembers that difficult, despite the doctor's tactics, a moment.
A young man hid it from his family.
Having decided to deal with the disease on his own, he wanted to know about it as much as possible, and his efforts were justified and he had already noted his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the oldest HIV patients in Hospital Civil de Guadalajara Hospital (HCG), where he was caught in 1994, overcoming many obstacles.
He has been living with the diagnosis of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) for 22 years, and in the early 1990s it would be difficult to believe that there were only too few treatment options, too little knowledge of disease, too much biased towards the sick.
So, even the director of the Mexican Social Protection Institute clinic didn't want to say goodbye to him because he had a cut.
In other words, in those days AIDS was a sentence.
Now it is possible to survive with the syndrome and to do so without the deteriorating quality of life.
Nevertheless, without knowledge of their illness, many people still come when the virus has already damaged their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the outbreak of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, “a major achievement for the time being is that the survival of a patient who starts treatment on time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same”, said Head of HIV, HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information was confirmed in a prestigious scientific paper in April this year.
Infectious and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the length and quality of life depends on the extent to which the immune system at the start of diagnosis is affected, with better life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with 200 CD4 and up to 50 years when 500 CD4 is reported.
To put it simply, the above means that whoever is diagnosed with HIV positive at 25 years of age, according to these terms, “supporting control can live without problems up to 75 years of age”, he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be borne in mind that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is an average of 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has declined from 6.678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died since AIDS.
In Khalisko alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths were registered by May of this year; nevertheless, there has been widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there so many fatalities?
- Personally, I don't think there's a problem with access to treatment.
That's the way I see it, it's the way things are at our hospital.
At least for the last 12 years, we have had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients are coming very late because they don't know what they're infected with, or at a later stage of the disease.
He cited devastating data: “Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality, so that it is diagnosed at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for detection on a mass scale for all people who ask for it.”
The proposal echoes the views of specialists and officials of the Council of State for AIDS Prevention in Khalisko (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who turned to the private laboratory only for what his friend did and, despite his youth, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffering from sarcoma Caposha, a cancer tumor, which is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything.
"If I die anyway, I'm better off three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I'm eating well, I'm doing exercises, I'm taking medication.
To this day, his parents only know he's had cancer.
I live a normal life like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of work, I travel, I have an active sex life, but I have a mutual responsibility, I care for myself and another person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO to raise his statement to those who are now afraid, in the context of World AIDS Day.
Let the risk of infection be checked to see if they are HIV-positive as soon as possible, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person who is responsible.
This report summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Adhesive condoms
A great gap between health programmes and a simple citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalahara, who addressed the HIV problem.
And the biggest thing is prevention.
In the areas devoted to this task, “the proliferation of condoms has actually increased, once we were given one or two, now we are given packages on a hundred, and that’s very good, but it turns out that there are those who still don’t have access to the condom”, he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why do you want them?" is a popular question, with the echoes and convictions, by social workers, school consultants, medical personnel and health workers, who don't want to hear teenagers, assured the propagandist.
I suggest that these inefficient distributions be modified; that condoms be not only behind the stalls and that a hundred be kept in public toilets in places that are often visited by young people.
This is not an encouragement to loose conduct.
It was not the beer and motel payment, replied Governor Emilio Gonzalez when asked whether it was possible to distribute condoms in his leadership.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms available to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Khalisko
13.435 total cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV) have been recorded.
The State ranked 4th in the national rating on the new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV.
92 per cent of the infections are sexual, 6 per cent through blood and 2 per cent to the perinatal pathway.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are between 4 and 5 people in one recorded case who do not know.
In view of the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of a decision cancelling the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt achieved through competitive proceedings in Mexico, the scenario sets an annual precedent for any national company with affiliates in a neighbouring country that has problems with capacity to pay.
Procedures to support the survival of firms permitted by Mexican law do not seem to be valid in the country in contravention of international agreements.
In practical terms, the approval of Judge Harlin Hale's judgement of 15 June in the northern Texas bankruptcy court leaves defenseless Mexican firms in the face of the possibility of arresting their property on that side of Rio Grande.
However, the order opens the doors to the lead glass producer in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court, leading to three inconsistencies.
As an admission, while the judge points out that creditors should be governed by the United States bankruptcy code, the Fifth District Court of Appeal, located in New Orleans, said that the main proceedings involved competition proceedings under consideration in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the annulment of international judicial cooperation in cases of inability to pay transnational enterprises.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law was established to that end, defining the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the verdict states that, without an inter-firm vote recognized in the critical mass of competitive debt production held before the parent company of the Vitro branch, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not be achieved.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme was adopted.
There are dozens of examples, including Agrimex and Commercial Mexicana, whose interfirm debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitive Production.
It is also true that by reading out the votes of the branches, in one way or another, Vitro creditors, who fought against him in United States courts, such as the “Earlios Capital” funds, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not reach the majority.
The voting would be 45 per cent, compared with 37.
These data are omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of the difficult situation that has been facing since 2008, affected by the serious economic crisis that the United States has faced.
So far, González Sad's family firm will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal itself so that the vote can reach its plenary, that is, five judges, because only three voted.
In the event of failure, an application will be made for a certificate that will require a review of the trial by the Supreme Court of Justice, in this case by the United States Supreme Court.
It is worse that the court rejected the document sent by the Government of Mexico as amicus curiae ("second court"), which described the process followed by Vitro under the Competition Procedures Act, signalling that it is exempt from compliance with agreements signed by both countries in order to link it to article 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, it is noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, i.e. the rules established in cases of inter-State insolvency that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Two-board carambol, they beat Vitro and beat the country.
General balance
In view of the several months of complaints filed on the table by Mexicana de Aviación's trade union against the former owner of the company, Gaston Ascarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraud, has already discovered bottled throats.
The institution headed by Carlos Diaz Chavez Morino has just filed a criminal case against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Office of the Procurator-General of the Republic concerning an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to withdraw from the trust fund of F/589 Bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
Resources would be directed towards the purchase of shares by the Professional Manager of Hoteles.
As you know, Askarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel network.
Dragon Mart surrounds
Meeting at weekends at the Caribbean University, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of general civil society approved the establishment of a broad front to confront the opening of China's Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, about the giant sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, of products from an isolated country, with a residential area close to 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra has been able to unite the governors of the South East zone to confront the monumental forces that have compared the land of the protected territories and pose serious threats against the industry.
ACTA Death
With regard to the Government's rejection of the Senate's request to explain under what circumstances and circumstances the Ambassador of Mexico in Japan had signed the Counter-Confaction Trade Agreement, known as the Abbreviation of the English ACTA, according to the Mexican Industrial Property Institute, the case had already become an archive.
As you know, the action has been implemented despite the fact that the Senate itself has disqualified the possibility of viewing it as a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to pay off long-term debts without affecting short-term housing, the Homex developer places 500 million pesos certificates on the market.
The release is the first of four identical, with a proposal to pay interest every 28 days.
Competival Appears to the Light
Its aim will be the market for software clusters in Central and South America, which is educated by NYCE, eQuality and Kernet, the leaders of information technology, the Competival trade consortium just emerged.
Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector Hetin Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Hector Hetin Reyes, a staunch basketball traveler, has been involved for over 60 years with this sport and, thanks to him, has travelled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector Hetin Reyes.
Before bleeding in the brain drove him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was engrossed in sports for more than 60 years as a player of small categories, a player of the High Basketball League, an authorized BSN leader with Baamon Cowboys and the President of the Federation of Basketball.
“I played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including a few at the same time as I was President of BSN, the Director General of the National Team and the President of the Federation in the 1990s,” recalls Reyes during his visit to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating by making this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorable things, gathered for his long journey, show this.
Bayamon in the Heart
With the greatest emotions, he keeps those who remember his way through Cowboy, starting in the mid-50s as a player until 1982 when he was 15 years old as a co-agent or agent of the contract.
"It was my best years to enjoy the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboy Championships since 1967 as an agent, an agent, an agent or a leader.
There were many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said good-bye to one in 1981, the debut year of Jerome Minsey at BSN.
From that moment forward, the leader has become Kuko Ortiz, who was the great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember Jean Bartov, who was on his way here at Alabama University, Birmingham, saying to me, "I have a very strong game for you, 6'7."
"Do you?"
And that was the beginning of Minnesota, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Bartov was then recommended by sniper Raymond Gauss, who gained citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Minsey brought the Bayamon Championship, Gauss would be able to win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboy Championship with Gauss, but it was already a long way, because by 1988, he was the head of the Federation.
By then, I had preferred to enjoy his achievements and achievements in the national assembly.
I remember when we first won the U.S. Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 Peace Championship, where we won fourth, and it was supposed to be a bronze if it wasn't for the Canadian judge who forced us to win the final game, Reyes said.
That 1990 World Cup team is the best team you've ever seen?
She's among the best, just like the one that won Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that since the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and broke down the U.S. collection, which was quite like the one that won the bronze on the world championship.
Not only did the team play Minsey, Gauss, Ramona Rivas, Fico López and Piculina (Ortisa), but also the young (Havier) of Tonito Colon and James Carter, the brothers Leon (France and Edgar) and Mario Quichote Morales, who was unable to participate in 90 years because of knee trauma.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was a team of the 1995 Olympic Qualifications Tournament in Neuken, Argentina.
With role-playing players like Canito Nieves, Pablo Alice and young Rolando Hurruitner in exchange for players temporarily suspended for riot at the Pan American Mar del Plata Championship, we won gold against all forecasts.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt, it was Piculin Ortiz.
His performance in international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level as Piculin did.
And that's without taking his career into account in the various leagues in which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very difficult question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From the young, I really like Leo Arilla's work.
What do you think is your main achievement in the Federation?
Participation in the most famous national gathering era between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s there were up to 17 teams in the season.
What's left to do?
There were things that I wanted to implement, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, boys from Ponce play only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in national playoffs.
Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and it's too much.
At least I see the fruits of mandatory certification and the course for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I'm listening to music, watching the music videos of my time on YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and the rarest go to basketball matches.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Ichabel, who has always been with me.
The actor Larry Hagman died.
Larry Hegman, born on 21 September 1931 at Fort Worth, Texas, became world-renowned thanks to his main role as John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the Dallas Teleser, in which he embodies businessmen without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil-breeding magnetist J.R. Ewing in the Dallas Teleser, was a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagmen, who returned this year as J.R. in the new season of Dallas, died on Friday evening due to the complications caused by cancer, according to the family's statement given to The Associated Press by Warner Bros, the Dallas studio.
“Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing once again a significant role that he liked best”, his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas at the fair for Thanksgiving.
Linda Grey, who played his wife's role in the original series and in the Sikvel, was next to Hagmen when he died at Dallas Hospital, said her representative Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, charming, and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," said Grey in a statement.
Hagmen had been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and admitted to drinking for many years.
In 1995, he had been diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the liver and had undergone a transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hagmen gained publicity on television thanks to the role of a decent type in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie" broadcast by NBC between 1965 and 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets the attractive girl-jin who is played by Barbara Eden, and starts living with her under the same roof.
He was also the main character of two comedies who rarely appeared on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the cinema included roles well received by critics, in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his master's interpretation of the magnificent J.R. that brought Hagman to the top of glory.
The Dramatic CBS series on the Ewing clan and other characters in its surroundings was on the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertised slogan "Who shot at J.R.?" designed to create a noise around the episode, a full emotion in which the character of Hagmen almost killed, gave rise to international discussions and millions of dollars at risk in bookshops.
It also helped bring a record audience to the show at that time.
When a response was given in November 1980, an average of 41 million television viewers watched it and turned Dallas into a second viewing programme in history, after the "MASH" final in 1983, which attracted 50 million viewers.
She was J.R.'s cousin Christine, who fired at Mary Crosby.
J.R. interfered with her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she didn't get out of town, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hegman played Ewing as a non-satisfactor with a charismatic smile: the dishonest entrepreneur and the unfaithful husband who wanted his wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Grey), to be treated.
"I know it's supposed to be on J.R.'s graveyard," said Hagman in 1988.
It has to be said, "Here comes an honest citizen of J.R. Ewing."
It's the only deal he's ever lost.
Victoria Principal, also the heroine of the original series, recalled on Friday, Hagmen, "someone as big as the screen."
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of worshipers all over the world, and in the hearts of each one of us who has found happiness in knowing and loving him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of Dallas were shown months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
Five episodes of the second season and six were already completed in production, the channel reported.
Warner or TNT have not yet made statements about what will happen to the series after Hagman's departure.
Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of an actress and singer Mary Martin, who was shining in classical works such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Martin was a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to counsel Ben Hagmen.
He tried to be happy on the theater scenes of New York in the early 1950s and then served at the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist named May Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived in the California city of Malibu for a long time, where many celebrities lived.
In 2001, he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolute True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't include anything in there that felt capable of causing or affecting someone in any way," he said to Prensa Asocida at the time.
After a liver transplant, he promoted organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients with fear.
"I give them advice, give them courage, meet with them when they go into surgery, and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a little while, but you'll be fine."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
A course is being started that examines the End of the Light.
Every week, students study apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
In this semester, when Professor of Religion Stuart Sharme decided to read the course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irrepressible bait: the end of the Mayan “long-term reverse” calendar, on 21 December, for which many people were taken as proof of the end of the world.
But Sharma had no idea what was expected of him in the next few months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis that some call "long-armageddon", and the growing conflict that will drag Israel, the place where Christian theorists at the end of time believe that Apocalypse would begin.
"I didn't realize it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all," Sharma told the students of the Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If we analyze what is happening in the world today, as if we had only 30 days left, it was a really good time.
And remember, bad things are good for those who have an apocalyptic attitude.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on the topic of the "end of the light" in this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Temple, Professor Barry Walker, adjunct Professor, reads the course “Media of the media, culture and the end of the world”.
Every week students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
“We’re looking at why these ideas are spreading over time”, he said, and the way that hypothetical scenarios suggest certain actions of a person.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war may break down.
This month, students analyzed the films on apocalyptic topics and studied how they relate to the examples of real life.
"I've tried to tell the students what's possible and not possible," said Walker.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amar Solari, Adjunct Professor of Art History and Anthropology, united to read a course called the End of the World.
"We don't add '2012' to always be able to read the course again, in case the end of the world doesn't come," Restal said.
Despite “imminent destruction”, students must learn, prepare projects and pass the final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken at the canon of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work “until the very night that the end of the light is expected to occur” said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"The city ended in two hours," Restall said of his course for high-level students who enrolled 35 students.
We received e-mails within weeks of the start of the semester, from people who asked if there was room.
Students, in turn, have assured themselves that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridged Robinson, a 23-year-old student in the department of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic image, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or absence.
Will Vequez, a 25-year-old psychology and sister-in-law student, said he was watching all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course to teach," he noticed.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed -- let alone a professor -- said he believed in the day of the end of the world on 21 December.
"Our first project affected Maya's prophecy, and in some way we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student at the University of Temple of West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there was an apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which had several centuries where people reacted to changes around themselves, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"In other places people don't think about it," he said.
Mostly in an English-speaking world.
Joseph Dogerty, professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to a question as to whether he knew of any course about the “conclusion of light” there.
“The Philippines is not taking part in the end of the world”, he wrote, hinting at a superior authority.
We have Pope's pardon.
Restall noted what had long been said about many days of the last court, and said that if nothing happened on 21 December, “people would immediately start thinking about the next date” or philosophies, that on 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and teachers are inseparable from this date.
Some said they were going to the "end of the light" parties.
"Maybe I'll call some friends to make fun of each other," commented Samir Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
