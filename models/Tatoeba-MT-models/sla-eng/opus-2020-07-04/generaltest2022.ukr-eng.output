Because I don't live in Prague, there may be transportation difficulties.
If there are no options, I still agree.
Thank you in advance.
In Herson, people went back to the rally, the Russians couldn't get out.
As the Westerners were told, the Hersonians were able to hold a rally before military rpm and equipment were brought to the scene.
"We were able to hold a rally, and the technique was just there," said one of the Western participants.
In the past, the towns traditionally held protests in the area of Liberty, near the ODA building and the bulwarks.
This area, like the building, is controlled by the armed Russian forces, who use weapons against rallies and kidnap people.
On April 3, Russian invaders reportedly used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kahovka.
According to Ukrinform, residents in Donetsk regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
Russian military forces use force and weapons against humans, wounded and detained.

Sasha wasn't at school today, so I wrote to the teacher for mail.
I'm sick, so I'd better move our meeting to the next weekend, sorry.
I know how to cook, which is the main recipe, but I like to bake a toast.
In Ukraine, the traditional ones are borscht, limestone, others.
I don't have favorites, I like to taste a variety of dishes in different countries.
Do you like cooking?
I want to be busy.
There's a train, and there's no space.
Sorry, we're a little late.

If Nazar works at 5:30, he can use any train:
Green: Mariupol – the heart of war, will stop fighting – we will have weak positions
President Vladimir Zelenski believes that fighting for the east of Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war – and if the ZSA fails there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and repurchase the deprived territories.
The direct language is, "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war for today.
It fights, we fight, we're strong.
If it stops fighting, we'll have weaker positions.
They are the people who have taken away a great number of the enemy.
The stronger our position in Mariupoli, the stronger our position will be in the eastern states, the (area) of the EIA, and if they are stronger, the table of negotiations will be closer to us and we will have the advantage of dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a situation that is weak in all these ways, we may not wait for a meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that could lead to the return even to the cities that we have now deprived.
They can go for it.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and perhaps not even interesting to the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we find that.
We believe in our result, our victory...".
Details: Greenski also said that it is difficult to negotiate after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we should not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have them."
The direct language is, "People will accept peace anyway, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, conditions for Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something -- and I don't think they'll be satisfied with any peace under any conditions.
But if we do not speak emotionally, the war must end in peace or end in millions of casualties.
And even where there are millions of victims, everything comes to an end to the war.
Yes, we must fight – but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing left, there's no people."
Hello, do you still have seats available for the Czech adult course from 7:00 on Tuesday?

New concepts were needed to describe its new quality as a result of the change in esthetics in Ukrainian literature.
It's an analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the state study.
Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows an analysis of the post-modern context as where metaphor plays an axiological role

Good, 'cause I'm starting to get drunk because I don't get it, and I don't get it.

The dining room needs code
Ukraine's Ministry of Defence's chief intelligence department published a list of Russian military personnel involved in the war crimes in Bucz Kyiv district.
According to Ukrinform, this is reported in Facebook by Ukraine’s Department of Defense Intelligence.
“Every Ukrainian should know their names!
MO GUR Ukraine has obtained a list of 64 military personnel from a separate motorcycle brigade directly involved in the commission of war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Butch,” says the report.
MOU notes that all war criminals will be brought to justice and held accountable for crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine.
The list can be viewed by reference.
According to Ukrainform, Irpin, Butch, Hostomel, and the entire region of Kiev were freed from Russian invaders.
Free cities and villages have recorded mass killings by Russian military civilians.
On April 1, Buchi, the city’s head, Anatoly Fedoruk, reported that 280 people were buried in brotherly graves.
Attorney - General Irina Venediktov stated that on April 3, 410 bodies of dead civilians were removed from the Russian invaders of the region of Kiev.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Road announced the start of a full-scale invasion in Ukraine.
Russian invaders fire and destroy key infrastructure objects, fire massive shells of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, fire-fighting systems, ballistic missiles, airbombs.
Hello, I'm sorry, but I can't work for you because I'm going to Canada as soon as I can.
Right over here, there's a regular name, there's a slang term, there's a shortcut in parentheses, there's a shortcut in the clock schedule.
I don't want to bother you, get some rest.
I watched the weather forecast, it's gonna be cold.
I don't need a brandy.
Just good clothes at normal prices and to make them size.
We were at the train station at the store.
Proposing professions, possibly without language knowledge?
It's important, if there's a tradition like this, I need to know if I'm going to prepare it.)
I thought about it a week later, but we're going to have a lot of cheese.
There might be a bad connection on the road tomorrow.
I thank each person for his experience, even if he is painful.
I believe that I have learned from each situation so as not to make mistakes in the future.
The directives are made in the form of numbered written supplements, which are part of this Regulation.
I'm sure that won't be a problem.
In Ukraine many people also celebrate this week.
It depends on religion.
Whether there's a man of Greek Catholic or Catholic.
at the beginning, you can try it free
Maybe you can write us a payoff algorithm, we'll pay for it ourselves.
We have the paper that children receive at the end of the school year, and the testimony is given at birth and married.

My heart belongs to you.

place, day and time will be specified according to interests and possibilities
We promised that if you went to school, we'd give you a surprise.
I have money for two months of rent, I don't care about the district in Olomouc, I'll be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of animal abuse from the civilian population north of Kiev.
The photos of the people who were shot and shot confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people question each other how this could have happened in the 21st century!
But I was not surprised at all, and that's exactly what I've been saddened to do.
I took the children and the elderly parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then a girl colleague with children, and only then did he return to work in the capital.
Since 2014, he has consistently assisted the U.S.S.A. and has no doubt that in the event of the occupation, the suburb of Kiev will not spare my family.
Because I was and I remain absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten Communist-KGBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror it just can't exist, it's built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandparents was shot in the prison of the city of Gitomir.
A few years ago, in the Gytomir’s U.S.S.S.U., a copy of the great grandfather’s shooting case was removed: the whole case is over a hundred pages, and the sentence for execution is very simple and even more terrifying.
The accused was illiterate, denied the error.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was of free people, a poor one-door road, had never walked in the collars.
The fact that they lived in the marshes and had several cows was enough to curse the pachar and feeder of young children to death.
The parents did not even know where the burial site was.
Grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village at that time and killed all but two who agreed to give false testimony.
The penalty case has Shari's name.
Our former speaker of the Supreme Council comes from a neighboring village.
My belief in genetics is not surprising if his relative was a KGBist informant.
An apple from the apple is not far off, as is known to fall...
The firing squad that ordered the execution of the peasants were ethnic Russians.
In his analysis of the subject, he was interested in various information resources.
There are beautiful information resources in Russia (without sarcasm) like the "Beast of Death" that reminds us of the events of those years.
Thus, in modern Russia, the descendants of the CNVDists have found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalinist repression and publicly wrote the names of murderers, the system first discredited and then destroyed.
It's like they found child pornography files on a computer, and they put her in jail, and he died there pretty soon.
The KGBists are now killing those who are trying to learn the truth about the crimes of the past century.
Why, then, are you surprised at their actions now?
There is a concentration of the most filthy features of human nature.
Slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th century were imposed on the surface of a thousand - year - old Ordinian tradition.
And then over what happened, they did an animal genetic experiment, cutting off intelligence during a few waves of red terror.
Look at the half-French movie "Chequest" in 1992, that's what happened.
You've seen my pictures in the bathroom.
Can you ask your wife what I can buy from a cough?
I'm sorry, I don't have to ask anyone.
I still wanted to ask you maybe you know where the kids went because Gale can't find them.
Lover, Igor asks if it is convenient for you to drive tomorrow? (It is a weekend and can go because the car has not yet been seen at the station.)
It's not very convenient for us to bother you so much.
You're very helpful, thank you!

We've come to a place where we've settled from the center to the Pardubice, conditions are good.
But there's a big one, but here men live drinking alcohol and smoking in the room, the loud music is just the tiniest thing that's sad, the smell of cigarettes of drunk men and me and the kids... the scary sleep is lying down if you're honest.
Please help me with the house, please help me with the money.
But where it will be safe and unsmooth.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is like this, it's not like they're smoking directly here.
I ask you very much, one of them barely standing on his feet, something shouting, something he doesn't like.

And I have a problem with that, if I don't love a man, nothing will work.
Yes, we took our aunts home and took them right away.
She thanked me very much, and she cried.
I told her about you and how you helped Ukrainians.
She had tears in her eyes.

My best friend was killed before him.
I had many questions about why situations in my life made me give up in everything.
I need to buy bread and other products.
It's just that I decided to go and you made a meeting.
That's the way it is, but we don't know where it is, and we don't know where it is. We've been looking for an hour today, and we're back on foot.
Even now, I've been thinking about you, and you've written to me.
Does your father only know how to speak Russian or any other family?
You can have the kids come to Vala and play in the lobby.
All right, then let's take a risk:)

According to The European Truth, Welt writes about this with reference to sources in government circles in Ukraine.
According to the publication, this proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 hobbies, including the curriculum and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As is also suggested by the haubiks in the BTR boxer option for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in battle have to climb relatively close to the goals of the opponent, Panzerhaubitze 2000 can lead fire more than 30 kilometers away.
According to Ukrainian government circles with reference to the KMW proposal, the supply of self-propelled locusts will follow a circular pattern.
Bundeswer in the shortest terms will give Kiev 100 of its own mushrooms, and the gaps that have been created will then be filled with industry at the second stage.
The first new locusts can be set up 30 months after the contract is signed, or earlier than the second half of 2024.
The full supply will not be completed until 2027.

I didn't even know big stores would be closed.
I cook the doves like this: in a casserole, I'm distributing tomato paste for 0.5 liters of water for 3-4 tablespoons of tomato paste to lead to boiling.
I put the doves in the casserole and pour them in the sauce.
The shower is about an hour and a half.
How much do I have on this room?
I have to bring it all in.

Lydia's been taken to school, but we're going to go to school on Tuesday because of the disease. I told her today.
I sit, I keep earphones on my ears, I listen to music, and I think about you and the kids.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy.
I don't know, sweetheart, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I feel like we're together, that we're a couple.
I'd say there's gonna be a lot of work after the war.
So I'm not afraid I won't find her there.
I know a lot of things.
So I'm not afraid I didn't get into any of them.
I just don't know what it's going to be like with the apartment.
I need to go through the food license tests, can I do that for you?
I'd like you to fill in for five guests tomorrow to make an apartment.
Is that how I understand the fifth place in the TV room?
Unload and seal the couch?
Can we stop at your place while Mrs. Margarita finds us a place to stay?
Don't worry about it.
It's not a new one that's been used, but it's a job, but it's not needed.
Write an address in Czech, see the map where it's from us.
I don't know how much room there is so I can't plan anything with the furniture this week to finally look at that apartment and then figure out what furniture I need.
I'm sorry for the long answer, working day, it's hard to adapt.
Is that enough for now?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want to finally be with you, to have a chance to hug you.
Kiss you in the morning, tell you what's good for you.
For a child there's already a bed and a bath, a river for the first time found

It's better if she doesn't take us with her, so she doesn't get infected.
I'm the only one who'll be a little bit later. Around 8:00, may I?
I don't want any misunderstanding with you.
Because I'm worried that everything will be all right!
Because we didn't even talk about it with these excisions!
I understand how important this is to you!
And I'm not talking about myself (for me it's just a vertex that I can't grasp)!
How do you feel today?
Hey, sorry, I just woke up, slept badly.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was upset that yesterday Kolya and I were having a bad time translating the test.
I’m going to ask whether Gregory Denisenck or maybe Jonah) for a little help with mathematical concepts.
Maybe I can be useful to them too?
If that's the case, I want to get mathematical terms on weekends.
Geometry is actually difficult, but we have to work with Kolya to make sure that we don't have any mistakes.
Thank you for your test assignments.
We look forward to it too.
And so she's very happy about any gift she's given.
Jab wanted to connect the Internet to his Czech number
Last night at the 402 stop, I met the Ukrainian woman Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is alone... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we've agreed to make friends.
And last night, I thank God for this girl, because this is the first person in Ukraine to feel my heart bonded with each other.

I didn't go, yes, I did, and that's what I can do, and the main thing is, you taught me how to turn the oven on.
So you're leaving town for a long time?
Six months ago, at the Holocaust Memorial Center of Babin Yar in Kiev, we honored 80 years of mass destruction by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babin Yar.
I had the privilege of speaking after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke of "the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We have to protect this base -- it's also part of our responsibility, which is related to our history."
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "there can be only one answer for us Germans: never again!
The fight must continue."
Today, Russia has invaded a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of civilians, starved inhabitants of blocked cities, and caused them to die of disease.
Russian troops are firing Ukrainians, even visualally like shootings at Babane Yaru.
For over a month, the Germans see it in real-time news.
Yes, Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, and weapons that have not been imagined for so long.
Germany is delaying the delivery of the heavy weapons required by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means more than just taking a stand against swastika.
This means fighting all possible means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes, and atrocities.
There is no easy way without the risks and victims to overcome the evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine.

Sergei Sidorenko: Our NATO membership has ceased to be a distant prospect
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of those polled spoke for.
After the Dignity Revolution, the escape of Victor Yanuković, the Anexia of Crimea and the beginning of the Donbasi war, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and the supporters, on the contrary, increased.
Since the start of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists have recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens – more than 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO is providing under the conditions of war, there is now much criticism at the expense of the Alliance and the country's members for the timely supply of arms, refusing to close the sky, refusing to “trembling” Russia.
Moreover, there is a high risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon its desire for membership in the Alliance through the RF position if it is able to stop the war and Ukraine will receive reliable security assurances, including military assurances.
In the new episode of the swear question subcast, together with the editor of the European Truth, we are talking about how he has helped Ukraine's Alliance since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our prospects for NATO membership are as close as ever in history and why the security assurances discussed in negotiations with Russia can become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think is here?
My partner in the Volt has indicated that my application is under consideration.
I gave it to you because of this mobile app.

In Ukraine, Czech Republic is reported to have shipped T-72 tanks to Ukraine and infantry combat vehicles.
I'm leaving my kids alone waiting there for three or four years and going home because I can't leave them anymore.
And take you with me for 6-7 years in the morning.
Yes, there was a heart condition.
I had a sincere feeling about this man, but he didn't do very well, and I left him.
After a while he returned and apologized to me.
I refused him.
Then a while later, he phoned about his heart surgery.
I asked him to just talk to me, and I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him for almost six months.
During this time, we had many conversations.
At the time, I had problems at work in parallel.
His support also helped me at that time.
Such mutual help.
And I wondered, maybe you really need to look at it differently.
And he asked me to marry him, and two days later he died.
That is why God himself chose our destiny.
What does it mean to be ready for your marriage?
And he only speaks Czech.
I wanted to say that I was able to find a place to live, and I am very happy that I now have a place to live and have a place to be with a child.

I understand very well the price of unqualified work, and I realize that a job like that I had at home in Kiev is not going to be able to have the money I made at home, and I'm not going to get it right now.
But just sitting there and doing nothing I can't do, because then all the bad thoughts in my head are pouring out so you have to do something physical.

The Russian army threatens to launch rocket attacks on Kiev: they say "no sooner did they."
Konaschenkova's direct language: "We see attempts at diversions and targets by Ukrainian troops on objects in the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such incidents continue, the Russian armed forces will strike at decision-making centres, including Kiev, from which the Russian army had previously been held."
The Russians have launched rocket attacks on Kiev since the first days of the full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, the Russian missile wrecked the Ukrainian PPO system fell on a residential building on capital Pozniak.
On February 26, Russia’s rocket hit a multistory on Valeria Lobanovsky’s prospectus.
On March 1, the Russians hit the Doregozhych TV station near Babane Yar, killing 5 passersby.
On March 2, Russian rockets flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defence took over the South Railway Station of Ukraine’s PPO systems.
On March 14, wrecked rockets destroyed the home and trolleybus on the Kurenovka in Kiev
On March 18, Russia’s rocket hit a residential mass on the Vineyard, which killed another 19 people, including four children.
On March 21, Russian rockets completely destroyed the modern Retroville TRC on the Vineyard, killing at least 4 people.
On April 13, Mer Kiyev Vitali Klicko announced that the capitals who had been evading the city were on their way back early.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still launch rocket strikes on Kiev, and also very many mines and unexploded ammunitions in the capital’s vicinity.
Ukraine's Ministry of Defence's chief intelligence department warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning a series of terrorist attacks in the territory of the Russian Federation to accuse Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army in relation to the civilian population.
On April 1, an oilbase exploded near Beelgorod, Russia, as it were the result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, Beelgorod’s local authorities claimed that a Ukrainian shell had fallen near the city.
Apparently, in Washington, D.C., and in Berlin, he throws cold sweat at the thought that the Nazi exterminators are going to knock down Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
However, Greenwich does not speak to them as much as to their constituents and communities in general.
By his speeches in parliament and in front of the numerous crowds in Europe’s largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that none of his predecessors have been able to do.
Green will not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, and it will convince the European nations who choose them.
And these talks, this sophisticated alloy of strength, tenderness, and despair, are gradually reaching their goal.
While Bayden is strongly opposed to closing the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels opposes Ukraine's rapid entry, this process is already under way.

They're tractors that actually go into the field under fire because it's time to sow.
These are bus drivers who agree to ride in rubber trucks today to temporarily occupied areas to get help and to take people out of there.
They are heroic leaders who, without fear, go into the war zone, calm down and help refugees in the cars, and at peaceful stations, help volunteers to carry a humanitarian car.
These are the car repairers who stood on the Gitomir Route in the early days of the war and patiently served the frightened and nervous people.
These are the communicators who fire garbage, repair water pipelines, and power lines to provide supplies.
They are doctors and nurses who spend 24 hours a day rescuing people, not complaining about anything, but volunteering to collect pills on the front.

The foreign constituency of Ukraine (USA) is a constituency that unites the constituencies located outside Ukraine and consists of voting facilities in the embassies and consulates of Ukraine and military premises abroad,[wine 1] with Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and DR Congo).[1] The role of the Regional Election Commission for the Foreign Electoral Region is being played by the Central Election Commission.

President Andrey Ermak, head of the Office, reported that Russia is launching a "fey operation" on the weapons that allies are handing over to us.
Ermaq's direct language: "They understand that they are losing the war, they see their backwardness, and they want to "beat" arms supply in any way.
One of the last fairies, for example, is the destruction of the S-300s handed over by Slovakia.
This information has already been corrected by Mr. Edward Heger.
We know the Russian scenarios, I'll call one of them.
They can launch feces that Ukrainian soldiers seem to give up with arms from allies, and it moves massively into the arms of the Russian army.
I want to warn these fairies right away.
For the weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the U.S.S.S. alone send an enemy to that world.

The international community continues to express its shock and outrage after the evidence that Russian forces have committed atrocities against the civilian population in Ukraine, and Moscow has rejected these messages as “provocation”.
“A report on the deaths, rapes and serious injuries of Russian troops to Ukrainian civilians is worth a conviction,” said Prime Minister Jasinda Ardern of New Zealand to journalists in Wellington on April 4th.
"Russia must answer the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Prime Minister Fumio Kisida of Japan called incidents “a violation of international law”.
The statements were made after reports were made that hundreds of civilians were shot and thrown into brotherly graves or left on the streets of Kiev, in Buch by Russian troops who left the area after the occupation for several weeks.
Photos that allegedly depict civilians being executed with their hands tied to them shocked many and led to calls for sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the guilty.
The president of France, Emmanuel Macron, stated in a radio interview on April 4 that there are signs that Russian troops have committed "war crimes" in Butch.
"What happened in Butch requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," said Macron, adding that additional sanctions should be directed towards Russian coal and oil exports.
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez of Spain said that Russian troops could go so far as to make a ‘genocide’ in Butch.
“We will do our utmost to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not become impunityable,” Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on public television late April 3, Russia’s Russian spokesman, Maria Zaharova rejected the charge as a “provocation”.
She said without proof that the United States and NATO had ordered images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these claims were made the first minute after these materials were made leaves no doubt about who ordered this story," Zacharov said.
In the past, the Russian Minoboros also claimed, without proof, that the images of Bouchi were “another act of the Kiev regime” and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called “the provocation of Ukrainian radicals” in Buch.
On April 4th, the Russian Committee issued a statement calling for a “investigation” of the charge of the “intelligence of misinformation” of the Russian forces in Buch, Ukraine.
President Vladimir Zelenski of Ukraine spoke on April 3, accusing the Russian troops of taking the genocide in the city, and told the Kremlin leaders that they had to come to Buchi to see what their military had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out," Green said in a video, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for shooting in the back of the head," he said.
He stated that the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and the Russian military should be responsible for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people tied behind their backs and decapitated, I don't understand," he said about the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Buchi, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kiev.
On April 2, Ukraine’s Radio Liberty correspondent saw bodies like civilians on the streets of a small city.
In just one place, the reporter saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists saw bodies at least 21 people in various places.
The bodies of one group of nine people, all in civilian territory, were scattered on the ground near a place that, according to the locals, was used by Russian forces as a base.
The victims appear to have been killed from a close distance.
In general, the Ukrainian authorities stated that the bodies of at least 410 civilians had been found in the area of Kiev, which had been controlled by the Russian forces until last week.
Thank you, there we are, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told, "Kiewa is not." As the invaders smuggled Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robbery, rape, murder, torture.
There is yet another point in this list, which is currently much less information - the export of the local population to the enemy's territory.
About mid-March, Russian invaders “evac” Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and territory in Belarus, which self-proclaimed President Lukashenko has actually handed over under a Russian military police force.
"Ukrainian Truth" has found exporting Ukrainians and their relatives to investigate how the same "evacuation" is happening and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
Heroes of this text were forced to evacuate outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and failure.
Fortunately, they're alive and in contact with their family.
In view of the claims made by the Ukrainian authorities, however, many citizens were expelled to Russia and Belarus under severe pressure.
So in Melitopolis, the Russians kidnapped second-grade laborers, drove children out of there without parents, including 12-year-old Miroslav, the daughter of Ukraine's dead champion from the voyage of Joseph Zachepinski.
Alexander's family, Marina, and their 10-year-old daughter Vale moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander just got a job at Antonov Airport, which is two and a half miles [2.5 km] from the village.
The family settled in a military town, although it was a civilian.
Like true plastics, Dennis and Marina had gathered anxious suitcases in advance, but in the morning of February 24th, they failed to escape.
They didn't have their car, and they didn't take anybody else's bus.
At about 12 o'clock on February 24th, they saw helicopters with a Latin letter V followed by the first shells.
One of them hit the next door.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks until March 17th until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In all, about 40 people hid in their basement.
Not all of them decided.
"On the 6th night of February 24th, the drive came by people who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
They say, "Who is it?" I say yes. "Get out!"
They searched me, asked if there was a gun in the basement.
All the men were questioned whether they had served in the army.
The women were told, "We came to protect you by Ramzan Kadirov's direction."
It was a Chechen OMON, not even an army, young boys 25-35 years old.
They said, "From the war we were assisted by Ukrainians, Sasko Billi (commanded by the UNA-UNSO "Wicking" Nationalist Movement Commander, who fought on the side of Chechens in the first Russian-Czech war, U.S.A.), now we are here to help you."
On the third day, they asked us what we needed.
We say that water was a big problem with it.
They broke the store, they took the goods from there under the "always Russian will take" and brought us six bottles.
There's a video on the Internet where kids thank Kadir for his food.
So it's after the shop was robbed that they brought the sausage and they said, "We understand it's wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Ahmadovic."
No one especially wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our kid says, "You have seven days to give up our phones," they laughed.
Still, they kept separating themselves from the Russians.
They said how good they came, because they didn't want to, and Ukrainians don't support, and they say, "Putin's a freak, too, but we can't do anything, because our families are there."
And mostly they didn't fight, they went to rob shops, they marauded.
The chicken was brought in, one was tied to one leg by a georgia ribbon, the other by its white scotch, and called it a militia.
In Ukraine, they arrived unprepared at all.
I don't know how their scouts worked... when they were beaten on the Butch, so they didn't even take the killers, they said, "What do you have, artillery?"
Moreover, we had confounded troops — Chechens didn’t know each other, in the first days asked passwords to find out whether they were one or another.
We had them before March 13th, and then the Russian OMON came, and behind them is the Ottoman paratrooper.
They put 30 or 40 units of technology between the houses -- ours always fell into it from the Beirectars.
But these came and told us that the ZSU was gone, but there is "Azw," and they said, "Azwu" is about a thousand hundred in Ukraine.
I've already given up the Kiev order since the beginning of March.
One day a Russian officer, or an FSB representative, came to our door and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we were listening to the radio -- it was about Butch, Hostomel, we thought maybe we were given a green corridor.
From the beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian authorities.
But they say, "You're being taken to Belarus, and then maybe Rostov."
We say we don't want to go there or there.
And they said, "Well, sorry for your children's psyche!"
As it worked, they put us in the basement and they started shooting from under the house -- or "Grosses," or mortars.
And then it came back... the neighbors' houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct hit on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
The part didn't go, saying it was for the traitors of the homeland, saying, "they're gonna shoot you, they're gonna sell you to the organs."
We were taken through Chernobyl, and on both sides of the road were the wreckage, the broken technique, although the Belarusians told us that the Russians were moving the technology right to them.
There are a lot of caponists, technicians, and soldiers.
We passed improvised control at the Belarusian "Comar" pass point, a lot of people were out of papers at all because they burned.
We were put in Red Cross tents, given tea.
And that's where we hear the shots!
Although these guys from the Belarusian Red Cross said, "No, they're flying, they're flying, they're flying, they're flying."
But we're on aviation, we have education, we understand that it is.
Then we were put on a bus and taken to the Chanky sanatorium near Gomel.
His leader, Wenger Vasil Stepanovic, came in and said, "Here, I'm a holodeck, I'm with Chernigov.
But I do understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these thieves are yours.
The poor people are suffering!
And we have Lukashenko so good!
He will say, "This is what he will say."
They offered to interview Belarusian journalists, but nobody wanted to.
The sanatorium administration told us, "You're traitors!"
And the people of the Red Cross and the United Nations (at least they were called) promoted misinformation that men in Poland could not be allowed to travel.
Many believed it and feared to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, even though we had a problem with the documents -- our daughter had no passport.
We were to receive it on Monday, and on Thursday, war began.
In the Ukrainian consulate, nothing helped us, and in Minsk, at the train station, we were told that no one would take a bus without passports.
I'm going to say that we had a lot of help from the Belarusian volunteers.
We were also settled in Minsk, and the escorts were made.
There was no force in the sanatorium.
Our second group of migration representatives said you could stay here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found an inside carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
As we passed by Mozir (about 50 km from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw the launches of ballistic missiles on Ukraine: the rocket first flies out, it glows beautifully, and then it goes out.
People who boarded a bus in Mozira told us that the Russians there were constantly shooting out of polygons.
But I can say that the Belarusians don't want to fight at all.
Generals are released from the army.
One woman told us she would break something if he was called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is, is not believed at all.
They say, "You lie, we are a peaceful people."
They don't understand that their polygons are used to shoot Ukraine.
In Poland, friends were waiting to take us to Estonia.
Now we're going to register, and we're going to decide what we're going to do next.
In Estonia, Ukrainian flags are probably as much as Estonian flags now."
Marina lived in a military town in Gostomel along with her brother's family -- his wife and two children, 18th and 22nd.
On the morning of February 24th, she called the nephews and asked them to collect the necessary items and documents.
In the evening they went to bed in the basement of the neighboring house.
Marina herself couldn't go home, and she couldn't go home; she's gone.
No one knew anything about the evacuation.
You can't go anywhere downtown on Monday?
Thank you, we have everything. And we're always waiting for you.
Thanks for the arrangement, the butterflies are nice
And in this little apartment, there's no Wayy Way, mostly for all of your questions I answer and now I don't know how to be?And kids have Monday classes online, and there's no Internet.
I mean, I'm going to live with two women from Ukraine and their children, is that a family who's willing to accept us?
The Koran says: “Even the leaves of the tree fall from his knowledge. ”
We have kids online, we have a salesman and a cook, but I can work in the fields and a cleaning woman, which is a rare Marjana specialist with the growth of the war, she can work at home, and Mariana's friend has no specialty, so he's a different kind of person.
Can I make a deal with you how best to do this?
On April 1, the city’s head, Butchi Anatoly Fedoruk, reported a joyful message: Ukrainian military personnel released the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the invaders were thrown out of all the region of Kiev.
However, the joy that the Ukrainians would feel at this point was darkened by horror and hatred, as it was also known that at least 280 civilians were shot by Russians alone.
They were killed on the street, some were tied up and shot in the back of the head, some of them killed -- minors.
The murdered and with traces of torture were found in the village of Motijin Olgu Suchenko, her husband, Igor, and Alexander’s son, who were abducted on March 23.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in the fraternal grave, and Igor was in the sewers.
Along the 20 km route from Kiev, several women dressed in blankets discovered bodies.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go home, nobody's gonna be home.
I ordered a shipment from Germany with DHL.
I was supposed to deliver it yesterday, but no one contacted me and no shipment was delivered, and the DHL website said that the payee could not be found.

I talk to you very often, and I think you hear my thoughts.
President Vladimir Zelenski stated that certain types of weapons supplied by Western partners were too late.
He said that in an Associated Press interview, which was published by the Office of the President, he wrote "European Truth."
"All the equipment, all they're sending, for some kinds of equipment it's done too late.
So what if we, for example, talk about Mariupol when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100 percent support, that's true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you can see the price of these changes," said Green.
On the question of this, Ukraine got enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president said, "No, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine were a NATO member, it would not be this war, or it would look different.
"She'd have opened up differently, we'd have the shoulders of close neighbors, we could have fought together.
But I'm sure there wouldn't be wars," he added.
Let's remind you, the Prime Minister of Great Britain has promised Ukraine new military assistance, which includes armory and anti-corrigible weapons.

He asked me to just talk to him and support him, and I felt sorry for him.
He was a very wealthy man and thought that maybe I was his toy and maybe I needed his money.
And then he made me an offer.
"There was a car in my yard, a crocodile like that, and she let go of my chest.
And they kept me in the house, and then they took me to the basement, and there were a lot of people there, about 400 people, breathing was nothing.
What about the apartment you dropped?
I'm really not there yet.
The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has already questioned this fairies.
The last two videos I'm going to watch when the normal Internet works.
There's a jersey at work or not, can you walk in what you have?
All right, he'll come over there and take them.
I'm not thirsty for anything.
I know I can't sit at your place and I need to work.
Thank you, but we don't need 1+1, and we don't need Ukrainian television at all.
I see all the news on the Internet.
And 1+1 is the pro-president, propagandist channel, not interested in me at all.
What happened at the stop with the man that the police and the ambulance were coming?
Diana didn't answer me, and you didn't answer me.
All right, I just need to print out the children's paintings, so it's gonna be okay.

I live to please you with my work.
In this case, I know a girl who's Ukrainian, but she's studying in the Czech Republic, in tourism.
You really don't want to come for a minute with your kids calmly and with your grandmother.
I want you to be with me, wake up next to me.
It's actually hard in a foreign country, and every day, it's getting more and more excited to go home.
Mrs. Agatha, if you want this picture, I'll take a picture.

"I tell her that TV and radio repairs have been delayed by the import details, and the friends and acquaintances warned not to make any calls when they're on the phone."
"For the rest of the month, we hide from the infu's mother-in-law about war.
It's been done so far.
However, in Plumca (female - UP) a fur on the pus and hind legs has been immersed — it can be from stress, food changes, and vitamin shortages.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, and the stress on me does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The loop, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, hears and sirens, and explodes."
Because Olga does not hear well and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter - in - law lived in an apartment with her incognito.
And April 1st, 93 years old Oksana Polova took up arms for the first time in her life.
"33 days I, as a guerrilla, lived with her in the apartment.
War was also hidden from her, and the fact that I was there formally came as usual for a few hours.
But when her girlfriend spoke, I gave her the receiver -- she listened for four hours, and then I sang for two hours."
The radio was always at the bedside.
Most of the time the mother - in - law spends in her own room.
It doesn't sound right, it's allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her walkers, I hid in my room.
First of all, I hid the receiver and the TV from her.
Then she called everyone who spoke to her, six or seven people.
I asked her to talk about anything but war.
I'm going to ask my friend, she's been there from the beginning to the end.
On April 17th, I have 2 apartments to clean:)
Good evening, I kind of didn't think about it:)

The British, who defended Mariupol in the U.S. lava, says they are ready to surrender to the Russians
A British military officer of the Ukrainian Marine Corps, who participates in the defence of Mariupoli, told his friends and family that they would build weapons and surrender to the Russian invaders.
Source: twitter page by Edin Eslyn, a British woman who has served in the MSA ranks since 2018, the BBC, with a reference to the members of the family and friends of Aslyn, Atlas News, with a reference to the words of friend Eslyn, who spoke to him
Literally twitter Eislin: "We got a message from him: "It's been 48 days, we've tried everything we can to protect Mariupol, but we don't have a choice but to give in to the Russian forces.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope the war will soon be over."
Aslin served in the 36th Marine Corps of the U.S.S.A., which is involved in Marioupol's defense operation.
Air Force journalists contacted Ann Wood's mother, and she confirmed that her son had told her on the phone that they were planning to go into captivity.
A friend of the military, Brennan Phillips, also confirmed to journalists that in the last phone call, Eislin had said about the plans for their surrender unit.
According to him, the brigade had completed their fights and food.
Journalists of Atlas News contacted his friend, who said that the Aslin unit intended to go into captivity to the Russian troops so that they would not get shot without weapons and bullets at the hands of the so-called cadre crews.
The social media also distributed audio recordings of a telephone conversation that allegedly referred to an American friend who was planning to travel to Ukraine.
In a conversation, Aslin said they were trying to get out of town in civilian clothes, but they failed.
The British once told him that in Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company Wagner.
Eislin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trrent, Nottingemshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to participate in the fight against terrorists of the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018 he officially joined the UCC and took an oath.
Aslyn's friends and loved ones called Johnny, and in social media he's more known as Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you, but I'd like to know if we're together or not.

Magisteric assailants for their losses in battle played a full game.

I am not afraid of work, even as I have lived in the village, so I can also enjoy working physically.
When You Can Get Things
It's a very interesting tradition for you. It's Christmas.
Last week, the Supreme Council approved Law 7176, which is called "To monitor the potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere".
Surprisingly, in fact, Ukraine's only potential threat to national security in the economic sphere has proved to be... the place where the members of the supervisory board meet.
Lawmakers believe that the decision-making process by the management board of the conditional State party in Kiev can solve Ukraine's national security problems.
We know that there are many new dangers to containment, but as long as no company is aware of the need to physically conduct meetings of the supervisory board at the location.
The potential threat to such a law is understandable, which is a great basis for us to "carry out" all acquisitions in the difficult reform of the state-owned enterprises after the Decent Revolution, including independent boards, and then establish manual management.
The same as before 2015.
Why should the company supervise the council, and who should be part of it?
Moreover, if a harmful law goes off under patriotic slogans, tomorrow others can fly - for example, the system of public procurement through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
Many things can be written down to war.
By the way, this initiative came before the war and law of 7176.
Thus, on February 22, this rule was added to the comparative table of Law 5397.
In general, the desire to disband the council in one way or another has been circulating among some national electors for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but to show the possible consequences of the legislation, let us consider the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then let's put our suggestions on how to solve the issue of governance in the war.
The First Deputy Minister of the Economy, Dennis Coudin, explained the need for such an innovation with the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication that would prevent the remote work of supervisory councils.
In other words, the risk is that the board will not be able to make the necessary decisions as to what the company's work might be paralyzed.
We agree that such a risk is, but can it prevent members from moving to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation in which independent members of the supervisory council (which are most of all members of the board) put their personal security ahead of the company’s interests and refuse to come to Ukraine.
Then, according to the law, they can be released.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum needed by the supervisory council to make any decisions.
Rather, it would be impossible to appoint new independent members of the Supervisory Board quickly, since the law calls for competitive selection, which lasts an average of 3 to 4 months.
Hence, the decision proposed by law 7,176 would likely not be able to prevent the loss of supervisory advice from making decisions, but rather it would!
The National MP, the author of the legislation of Dmitro Nataluh, gives other arguments to support it.
In particular, he says, "a lot of businesses, such as the defence and industrial complex (OPC), are now in need of relocation," and so "it's hard to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna to Zoom discuss addresses and other meaningful information."
To begin with, there are hardly any State-owned OPCs with oversight boards in Ukraine.
The Supervisory Board is not in Ukrobornpromi, which essentially manages almost all the state-owned enterprises of the OPC.
But even in Ucroboronpromí, according to legislation, the board of directors has rather limited powers, and all its members perform duties not on a free basis.
The full power of Ucrobornromi belongs to the Director-General, who will, by the way, decide on the need for a re-location of a company that is part of a concert.
Moreover, such an argument does not stand up to criticism because Law 7176 does not make any changes in legislation that regulates the activities of SWAps.
On his Facebook page, Mr. Dmitry also cites arguments that can be classified as "emotional."
Such arguments tend to have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of holding companies and holding banks, but let's try to figure out some of them: "Dear foreign experts with the first word "war" leave Ukraine as early as 2021, but remain members of the supervisory councils in Ukraine's state-owned enterprises with a full salary of several hundred thousand dollars, while Ukraine itself suffers from war."
First of all, it's manipulation -- most of these board members never lived in Ukraine and only come here periodically.
So to say that they're leaving Ukraine, to put it mildly, unfairly.
Secondly, as a result of the Coronavir pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian board members have long been involved in the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been widely used in world practice, in absolutely different areas: business, education, medicine, and so forth.
Nor should we forget that membership in the Supervisory Board is not a full-time job.
They usually have other employment, and it's the electronic communications that helps them do that.
Thirdly, all these claims are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
Interestingly, why does Mr. Dmitry not make identical claims to the members of the board of directors who are Ukrainians?
Because they're not at the location of their companies either.
In short, this is not the first popular attempt to remove foreigners from the board of directors, and war is just a new, convenient opportunity.
Hi, I'm in Ukraine, and I'm looking for options for a temporary shelter in my family, and I have two kids with me.

We usually need an adult's passport.
In Brovarski, Vyszgorodsky, and Buchansky regions of Kiev, which were liberated from the invaders, a 2 - day curfew will be established.
Pavluka's original language: "In the settlements of Brovarsky, Vyszgorodsky and Buchansky districts under Russian occupation and were liberated by Ukrainian defence forces, the curfew has been strengthened!
These cities and villages will have restrictions from 21:00 p.m. to 06:00 p.m. on April 5. "
Details: According to the head of the obwala, it is strictly forbidden to stay on the streets of towns and other public places, to travel by road and on foot.
Residents can only go out on the street during an alarm call to go into hiding.
Such restrictions have been introduced in order to eliminate the effects of Russian aggression — to clean up and displace territories.
Omelianjuk urged the people who had left these areas so far to stay away from their return.
In the rest of Kiev, the curfew will last from 9:00 to 6:00 a.m. every day.

Following the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries have taken the forecast of possible worsening in the Balkans quite seriously.

Lukashenko’s regime has held three Belarusians for 27 and 28 years, which have been involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of a signal system under Osipowicz, which ensures the train movement.
Source: "Radio Swoboda", Spring Defence Center, Head of the MVS Criminal Police Gennady Kazakevitch, quoted by Belta State Information Agency
In the Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs, it was reported that on the night of March 30, three Bobruysk residents were detained, one injured.
According to Clear, the men in custody were actively resisting and trying to escape.
The security forces used the weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were given medical attention on the spot.
The Chief of Criminal Police of the Ministry of Belarus, Mr. Gennady Kazakević, stated that "the acts of terrorism in the RB railway will end violently" by using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another worker from the Belarusian railway, a fellow member of the Baranovice Department of BZD and the administrator of the BZD thematic resources at Vkontaktie and Unicorns Valentin Samasusyuk.
Where it is now and where it is unknown, @belzhd_live reports.
At the end of March, at least 40 railroadmen were detained in Belarus for diversion.
Let's remind you: The formation of BYpol, declared extremist by Lukashenko's regime, continues to call on Belarusians to provide diversification on the railway transport and infrastructure of Belarus within the framework of the Peramaga plan.
In this way, the Belarusian River guerrillas try to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.

U.S. Prohibits Investment in the RF and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, are launching new sanctions against the daughters of President Putin, the biggest banks of the RF Alpha Bank and the Bank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
This is described in a report on the site of the White House.
Sbeerbank is Russia's largest financial institution owned by government, and Alpha Bank is the biggest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any assets they have in the U.S. financial system and ban US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the RF.
To that end, U.S. President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investment in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their whereabouts.
"This step is based on a decision adopted by over 600 transnational companies on how to get out of Russia.
The output of the private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retail traders, financial institutions, as well as other service providers such as legal and consulting firms," says the White House statement.
The third step in new US sanctions has been restrictions on large Russian state enterprises in the critical sphere.
This will prevent US citizens from performing operations with these organizations and freeze any assets they have in the State's jurisdiction.
A detailed list of the Minhin will be published the following day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of the adult children Putin, the wife and daughters of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Lavrov, as well as the members of the Russian Security Council, including the ex-president and prime minister of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Misustin.
The sanctions derail them from the U.S. financial system and freeze all the assets they have in the United States.

We lived beautifully, but we did not even think that we would be forced to flee because there was no more strength to hide in the funeral.
I was lucky and found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
So we have hope that for the first time, we might even be able to pay for a room or an apartment, but if it's on our pocket.
We guarantee cleanliness and order.
We do not have harmful habits.
We will be grateful for such help in such an unforgivable time.
After lunch, I had one English lecture, and after that, I went to work in a children’s room.
There I explained to Margarita how to fill out all the documents.
I hope she understands everything and does it well.
I also met Mrs. Lena and talked to her about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She's got an announcement from the pool.
It's free swimming.
You can call school, Kira doesn't pick up the phone, she doesn't answer, I don't know if she went to school.
They isolate the Russian office: stop the investment and stop the supply.
However, we did not agree.
There was no military service in our home.
Our home is near a military section and an oilbase
He just helped me because I couldn't do it myself.
I prepare well, don’t ask too much, and give good advice
I'm doing my best.
It's a little hard for me, but I understand that I have to go through this stage.
I'll meet you on Thursday and I'll tell you everything.
It's all right.
How often do you clean up?
I clean up every week.
I'm afraid I don't have a program, but I'll try to figure it out.
I Dreamed to Be a Teacher
My girls can't move now, so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you that if you heard the information about your residence, you'd let me know.
I'd love to rent a place with some decent girl.
If you know one, let me know.
For my part, I won't fail.
Thank you very much.
I haven't written yet another Natal 54 years. Please write an exact address and how much the courses cost.
I think you'd better make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
I haven't changed my last name, it's one since I was born:)
I'm sorry, I didn't see it, and I'll send it to you right away.
We're going to medical school right now.
I mean, Annie needs to work on another day.
On what day is she better to come early?
I'll listen to you tomorrow, the Internet is not working well.
You're lucky you're gonna do it.
Thank you... for finding something out of the stuff, but there was nothing out of the technique...
Both beginners, except the alphabet, we don't know anything.
Nothing's happening.
Can we do 25.04 on Monday?
You can take the kids with you, the toy here is enough :)
I guessed about dad.
I'm probably very naive or very in love, but I'm going to make something up with this money.
We'll do it one day.
But if it's paid, please, no credit.
Write it down, and I'll help.
We're your partner, or I'm not your partner.
I don't know.
Should we take the clothes they gave us?
Today's not my day. The blinds in the living room broke. One in the morning.
Something came from you, I don't see that
I'm sad too.
Let me remind you of the invoice later.
You're the only one who talks and understands Russian?
On what day does a colleague want to do house cleaning, and how many windows do they have?
I'm ashamed to distract you from your business.
Good evening, I can't share with you.
I'd like to read Joe Dispensa, he's doing scientific research on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neurons.
Natalia Nagorna, a television journalist, released on April 12, a video that was handed over to her by the 36th Marine Corps of Mariupol.
In it, the military say they have no weapons left to participate in battles and the mountain of the wounded.
They said "count's coming in an hour."
Prior to this, on April 11, 36th, a separate Marine Corps unit involved in the defence of Mariupoli issued a press release to the Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement stated that April 11 could be the last fight for the supporters of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military commanders did not contact the fighters for two weeks.
In the social media, skeptics said that the application was published in Russian.
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valérie Załugny, has assured that the link between command and defence forces in Mariupoli is and the details of the defence operation should not be subject to public discussion.
The Russians threatened to lock down Ukrainian fighters in the territory of the Azestal plant in Mariupoli and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, the Russian invaders threw away the poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
According to Azova leader Andrey Biletsky, the RF army has used chemical weapons over the Azavstal plant, which will keep the fighters from holding the "Azov" regiment.
Thank you, I'm going to put myself under you, and that would be very good.
Same situation as before we're here.
2 hours of driving)) walks, mom shopping and back)
It's not a big deal.
She forgot what she was gonna do here.
The Czech drone squadron has since started flying over Ukraine.
Nearly 50 professional diggers will be used for detection, and some will be used for the immediate destruction of an enemy invader.
Two Carpathians and two Czech bird brothers were sent to Ukraine yesterday thanks to the MP of the Mukachev mission, Vladimir Labutenko.
Because today, their mountain friends, led by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/example101/ Vasil Šur, delivered drones for their purpose: they were given special units of Ukrainian troops in different cities, where fighting is currently taking place.
In order to make the most efficient and safe use of the miners, we will leave their locations in the dark.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army in the Czech Republic do not plan to stop doing this are saying that in the next few days, many more interesting “gifts” will be sent to Ukraine to destroy the Russian invader and preserve the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I don't care, I'm fine, I love sweet, but I can do it without him.
I'm worried we won't make it.
I'm going back to Ukraine, I'm going back to work.
All right, if it's all right, I'll agree.
I'll try it myself, but if there's any mistakes, I'll write it down for you if I can?
The key to understanding each other
We were personally in the old lady's village in Jov, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there was no apartment
Maybe she'll be happy and she'll be in a lot of mood.
I got my phone repaired today.
And I think I'm still cold out on the street today.
I drank medicine and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm sorry, too, but I'd better meet you when I'm healthy.
When you have time, drop the music you like.
I'm curious about how much music you've got.
Mom and Dad should listen.
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's wheel.
It's cooler today, and it's raining, and tomorrow's gonna be warm tomorrow.
But no harm done to destroyed houses, no harm done to the people who are abused by the invaders.
In Herson, the invaders were greeted with a memorial called Slava Ukraine in Herson on Preskopiska Street.
Details: The unknown flag of the European Union is said to have been blown up by photographs of the Sky Hundred and killed in the Russian-Ukraine war.
The invaders took down the portraits of the celestial heroes of the hundreds and dead participants of the Russian-Ukraine war.
They took the flag.
Good morning, thanks to the kids for the Christmas, we don't have that kind of habit, so we didn't know if they'd just give the kids chocolate and biscuits, maybe something else had to give them.
There's a lot of people to talk about if anything.
Because I live like a dorm till twelve people are here, and then they go to work.
Hey, it's a little bit better.
I've been to a manger today.
Even today, I've slept there.
So we have made great progress.
I'll have to bring the cookers some other time!
I don't have the power to make them these days.
Since I am repulsing from the days and times that have been taken to clean the apartments after the guests, I can say about the month of April because I already have an approximate schedule for the cleaning of the apartments.
And by May of May of the month, I can say roughly at the end of April or at the beginning of May.
I just asked if you had anything to say about it.
Hi, I'm sorry I didn't write off dinner for a long time, and I slept a little bit.
If you don't mind, could I come today?)
or we'll see you after you're here.)
He's modest, he's been learning a lot lately.
Hi, it went very well.
I was a little shocked to work with people in such a high position.
Today, she has learned from a lady who is the head of the county's economy.
She was very pleased with my work.
Grishka at the manger behaved well.
On Monday, I have to get confirmation of the employment and the cash payment for the mangers.
I'm on Friday.
I do nothing but do many of them and sleep (and pyo a lot of water)
If she's going to the doctor tomorrow, I'll go with you if I can.
I have to get another analysis.
I don't have to drive again.
It's a really bad thing to do, it's a really bad thing to do, it's a really bad thing to do, it's a really bad thing to do.
So there's enough in there.
Can you send me the right e-mail address?
I would like to send you an invitation to the course of the Czech language you have enrolled in.
And do children feed there or should they bring with them?
And now for a moment you can come up with one question.
If You Need More Help, Write
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating the Passover tonight, right?
From the start, we didn't want you to raise money so people didn't think we were speculating on it!
But for online filling, I didn't have two options:
I'm going to get some rest, get some energy, thank you for today's gift.
This is a great idea, and I'm going to watch a video right now, and it's going to be good because the whole family is going to draw.
Karasin University urges employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in menses and social networks, rumors and gossip.
Just focus on the official information.
So you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who stayed in Ukraine, is also helping the army.
I've got some portfolio work to do.
After the holidays, they're supposed to be on the Internet.
I'd like to be your backup designer.
How I'm supposed to count the day that I wasn't at work is a pass.
Deploying headquarters: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army can resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against the neighboring state".
Literally, "It is not precluded by the Russian Armed Forces of the Russian Federation from undertaking provocative actions in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of aggression against the neighbouring state."
Details: The opponent continues to create the next group of forces for action on the Slogodish direction.
Probably the next few days, the invaders will try to reinstate the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and dispatch special forces, weapons and equipment to participate in combat activities in Ukraine.
Preparations are under way for weapons and military equipment at the station of the 60th stand-alone motorcycle brigade (Monastery) of the 5th Eastern Military Army.
Likely, these weapons will be transferred to the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk.
Also in order to recover the loss of a special unit of the battalion tactical unit from the 36th individual motorbike brigade (Borzia, Zabaykalska region) 29 of the eastern military army, a collection of military personnel from the designated brigade is being carried out.
The enemy has a particular problem in the assembly of driver positions and driving mechanics.
The presence of the selected special ingredient at the location is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Probably, an opponent to disrupt the supply of cargo to combat sites will continue to hit transport infrastructure facilities in Ukraine to destroy them or disengage them.
The designated military units of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Biloru border in the Brest and Gomel areas.
In the Slogodian direction, separate units of the 6th General Army and the North Navy Coastal Forces continue to block the city of Harkova, continuing artillery shellings of individual areas of the city.
In the Izum direction there is an aerial search of the area in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
To that end, the opponent applies the "Orlan-10" BPLA.
By force to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to launch an attack in the direction of Dovgenyke and Dmitrik’s population, failed to succeed and went to a previously occupied position.
In Donetsk, the opponent’s main efforts continue to be focused on the takeover under the occupation of Popasna, Rubizhne, Lower and Novobakhmutka, as well as the complete control of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to storm the Golden Circle, but he failed.
In the city of Mariupol, by means of artillery and aviation, the invaders continue to take stormy action in the areas of the Azestal factory and seaport.
Through the forces of individual units, the enemy fired artillery shells at the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas inhabited by the High-Pilla, Trudojublka and Maryansk.
In Donetsk and Luhan region, Ukraine's supporters for the past era have seen four enemy attacks, five tanks destroyed, eight armoured units, six units of vehicle technology and eight artillery systems destroyed.
Don't you understand what you're thinking?
We'll do our best, of course, but I doubt it.
How could you want to sleep and I'm holding you back?
You sure you don't mind me coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see me today, so tell me, I'll get it.
We didn't even watch TV at home, and we didn't have to set up one plus one.
I'm only going to turn on TV to listen to Czech language
I'm running out of tariffs a month today:)
Can we do this on the phone today?
Buy stitching fabric, rope, thread for stitching
I understand, so I can prepare the material in this area.
I'm gonna ask her, I'm ashamed to ask, she's giving us a lot of pies.
I'll see my father, I'll be sure to see you later.
I read the announcement in Facebook, I guess Google wrote something. I think the phone number's good enough.
Hello, we're the things you brought, but are there things you can bring us in 10 minutes?
I was thinking about the job.
If you're comfortable, I can start working the next week because tomorrow afternoon I plan to go to the office to file papers (if I can, because it's very big queues) and Saturday rain:
I'm looking for a brigade at the beginning, and I loved chemistry at school, and I learned Czech to know perfectly, and I dream of working on TV.
Friends of old and not so much, friends I don't know personally, friends of spirit and mind.
Now difficult times have come for you too.
During the last month, I talked to many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, has turned to your head, as has the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have confessed to feeling guilty and ashamed by your country’s actions in relation to your neighbors.
Because of why they're giving up Ukraine on your behalf.
Some of you activists have been in danger for a long time, and you've been preparing for the final strike.
Early in March, I wrote Alexander Chercasov, my very old friend from the Memorial.
Let me tell you a little bit later, as usual, Sascha said laconicly.
And others -- cultures, artists, critics, writers -- are struck by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: with the exception of very few of you -- the ones who worked at the Memorial, the New Gazette, the Echo Moscow, the Medusa, the Naval organization and a bunch of other places -- have many of you ever done anything to counter this regime?
Except for participating in rallies while they were still taking place.
Also read a column of Russian journalist "It's too late to hide, it's too late to keep quiet."
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not simply abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your long - term indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy, and your passive co-participation, which may now have been a heavy burden on your soul and heart?
This was not always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a short period when you had to some extent freedom and democracy -- disorderly even bloody but real.
But 1991 turned out to be no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you finally get so much fear of sadness that you're looking for salvation behind the king's back, let's say his name is Stalin or Putin?
As many people as he kills, you still feel safer around him.
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of seizing and publicizing the KGB archives, as the Germans did from the stasis, you took your soul to the Dzerjinski memorial, and allowed the KGB to lie down, to be updated, redesigned, and taken control of the country.
When you were put before the election between the theft of the country and the return of the Communists, you didn't fight for option three, and you humbled yourself with the robbery.
In 1998, your economy fell, and this marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or war in Chechnya.
Survival was a major concern.
Putin came up, young, entrepreneurial, aggressive, and he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you have bought it, but either you voted for it or you prefer not to vote for it at all.
When he began to equate Chechnya with the earth again, most of you closed your eyes to it.
I remember those years well.
I was then working in Chechnya, helping the victims of the Putin "anti-terrorist operation", and I saw with my eyes the ruins of the Gross, Qatar-Yurta, Itum-Kali and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I went back to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors that I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the killings of children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You told me, "Bred, we're tired of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
And in response, I was angry, "Hey, guys, this isn't my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid alien here.
It is your authority that will bomb one of your cities, kill your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise in the middle of the zeros, caused by rising oil prices and Putin’s willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that part of the stolen money would remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have made a good living, some of you have made a fortune, and even the poorest of you have acquired a new home and have found a better job.
Prices went up, but is it bad?
Moscow shimmered and shimmered from the shik.
When several opponents were killed – Yuri Szczecochin, Anna Politkowski, Alexander Litwink and others – many of you were shocked and horrified about what was going on.
However, the matter did not go on.
When Putin passed on the post of President Medvedev after two terms, and he himself took the prime minister's seat, I can see that you barely paid attention to it.
When after a few months of Medvedev’s reign Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored or said no.
How many of you have I met in the coming years on Gudauri mountain slopes, on the outskirts of Kazbeg or in the cafes and in the Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit, we've hardly done much in the West, if we did anything at all.
A little indignant, a little bit of sanctions; but what was the significance of Russia’s flagrant violation of international law when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas and the internal market?
It was good to live in Russia.
And after the difficult 1990s, that was the most important thing.
But by the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, woke up anyway.
When Putin switched places again with Medvedev and sat down the presidential chair, as before, many of you decided it was too much, and you went out to protest.
Nabalny's name has become very clear, you haven't been out of the streets for six months, and the regime has finally felt horrified that it's losing ground under its feet.
Then he struck back.
Alternative actions were first organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were behind bars.
Some have received tremendous terms.
"And what could we do?"
I've heard it so often, and I still hear it.
"The state is so strong, we're so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Enraged by the pro-Russian president, who betrayed their European expectations, they once captured Maidan – and never left him again.
They built the tent town on their own and prepared for a firm defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, armadillos, and molotov cocktails.
Finally, the police opened fire.
Instead of running away, however, the Protestants turned into an attack.
Many have died, but they have won.
The fugitive became Janukovic, and the Ukrainians returned to democracy, the right to choose and expel leaders on their own if they do wrong.
The field was very displeased with Putin.
That was a bad example.
So when he took advantage of the general confusion, he took the Crimea.
Some of you were opposed, but the benefits were limited.
And how many of you were delighted!
As far as I know, 91% of the citizens of Russia supported the annexation.
Suddenly, a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his scepter suddenly returned 180 degrees and began to worship him.
I find it difficult to find a reason because immediately thereafter we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained friends were mostly silent.
"We are not interested in politics," you said.
And you've been hiding in books, movies, ICT catalogues and parks, as new after the restoration that Moscow started in 2012, with their binghes, a public-accessible Viffa and a hipster cafe.
Indeed, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful – and it's only getting better.
You hardly paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, weren't there?
IDOL or something, even the Moscow editor who released my book on Syria criticized it then in an interview because I didn't really understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and I saw State snipers shooting at my kids' peers on the streets of Homs.
Among all the citizens of Russia, there were only your soldiers who began to bomb thousands of civilians in 2015 and gained experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you are familiar with the words of pastor Martin Niemeller:
"At first they came after the Socialists, but I kept quiet--because I'm not a socialist.
And then they came for the union members, but I was talking -- because I'm not a member of the union.
Then they came for the Jews, but I kept quiet -- because I'm not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left who could say anything to protect me."
How many of you have spoken of Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But the vast majority spoke.
Some are actually saying now -- like Dmitro Glukhowski, Mikhailo Shishkin, Mikhailo Zigar, Maxim Osipov, and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from within the country, like Marina Ovalnikova, risking getting into a new GULAG or putting together a company called Navel.
As for others, you know best which country you live in.
So I'm sure you understand that when Putin gets through with the Ukrainians, or that seems very likely, if he doesn't, he'll take over for you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who are courageous, but mostly alone, he has gone out to protest and is still insignificant, but he will soon get more serious.
For thousands of you who have signed petitions, who have expressed disagreements in social media (even black squares in Instagram) or have spoken in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were simply for anecdote were not so far away — and now they are likely to be waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you then?
The example of Ukrainians – even more than in 2014 – frightens the Putin regime: they prove that they can be combated.
And that mind, motivation, and bravery can stop him, no matter how depressing his advantage on paper.
In view of everything, few in Russia are aware of it, as well as the fact that there is a war going on.
But you, my friends, know exactly what's going on.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine that you're in touch with.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be ready.
You understand what this is all about.
A fine life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your choices are just a hohma, your laws, if you don't mind the reprisals, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media are gone, your economy is ruined faster than I'm writing, you don't have any credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if there's still any flights left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try to go or you'll get crushed.
I doubt you see any other options.
Still, there is another one.
Which will eventually overwhelm this regime.
And maybe if you do, you'll need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark is not going to burst out of you: because of the economic collapse on Russia, it is likely to burn in the provinces, in small cities.
When the prices fly and the wages are not paid, those who voted for Putin all these years because they want bread and peace will go out on the street.
Putin knows this and fears these people far more than he fears the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city comes out on its own, as has been the case periodically, it will not be difficult to suppress them by itself.
Organization and coordination will be required. The crowd will have to be converted into mass.
You have this amazing magic tool -- the Internet, which can be restricted, but which is still working, and which can be adjusted in almost any way.
The Nabal organization has been destroyed, but others, more informal, more decentralized, can be created.
A lot of you, millions of you.
Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, possibly hundreds of thousands.
If it comes out over 300,000, it'll be shocked.
The army will have to be used, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to it?
After all, what did he force them to do in Ukraine, all he could do was get them to go?
Of course, the danger will be great.
Many of you will feel a sense of fear; those who have children will fear for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I'd be afraid of you, too.
In the case of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happened to those who dared to neglect their master, who dared not only to demand freedom but was really trying to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will throw a joke in the chat room of the computer game -- and he will be arrested; your daughter will express resentment on the Internet -- and she will be arrested; your dear friend will make mistakes -- and she will die in the Syrian chamber under police clubs.
That's what's been going on for years -- and it's just going to get stronger, getting bigger and bigger.
So you don't have a choice, and if you don't do anything, you know what this ends.
Act coolly, think strategically, and make it a reality.
We were at class on Friday, and we were told that we could come Monday.
During the evening, we'll be home.
What do you think of me as a press secretary?
How often do you go to a expensive restaurant?
I go to dinner at a very expensive restaurant once a day.
I'm trying to explain everything to her.
So we liked it very well and we wanted something closer so it's a better choice.
She was in a room where there were a lot of people.
I don't feel well, cough, temperature, voice loss, weakness, and head swings.
I have to go to that government of labor.
We've already done it, but we've told them who signed up in April will only get the money at the end of the month.
Thursday we need a pass, go to the doctor with the children.
But at night I was writing to a lady who liked your work, and she would like something from you in her house.
I'm waiting for new news, and I'll be sure to report it.
Working at the D.A.'s office, I thought I was building a career, spending a lot of time and energy.
I had a complex psychological, responsible, mental job in which I was completely disappointed.
It's a pity for lost time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I am communicative, but my love for one another and my concern for marriage are serious.
There was one man I was supposed to marry, but he died having a heart problem.
I think to make a family, people have to love, respect, trust each other.
At the moment, I didn't see it like that.
Good afternoon. Where can I find the form for baking the cane (paper or silicone) in Jedus?
Okay, thanks for the advice, I'll take a testimonial to Valya right now.
She's got an STI lying down, she's got now her leg broken in a plaster, her lollypop, her food all sweats in her blender.
Mr. Rayhard, I'm sorry to bother you in your spare time.
But I have an important question for you.
I went into the game room with Natalie today, saying hello to her.
She was in a bad situation.
Because when the children went home, one mother refused to take the baby because she said she had come to look at the things and to put them in that room with clothes and Mr. Valérie opened our nursery yesterday until 7:00.
Is that really the case?
The working hours are up to 4 p.m.
And this is ultimately our responsibility.
But I don't have a load not to open a very weak web page
Hi, we're fine.) Kolya works, she's filled out the invitations yesterday, and I've been working with the seniors before the high school exam.
The most difficult thing to do is to take care of geometry.
On Saturday, Vladimir helped us.
Vica studies universities and high school programs.
Can we pay for the apartment and wf?
Thank you very much for your accommodations.
Yeah, but I thought you didn't fill in.
We'll try to get as much money as possible by the end of the week as we can.
