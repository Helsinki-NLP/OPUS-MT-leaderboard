Tom was very surprised.
They tried to win the time.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among mankind, spoke in a horrible, Jewish sense, Galilean dialect of Aramaic, instead of Hebrew, thus showing the insatiability of claims of a sacred language, which is especially close to God in prayer.

"Do you speak Greek?" "Not yet, it's my first lesson!"

Did you go to Boston last week?
He didn't play tennis yesterday.
Let me do it again.
We must respect their wishes.
How did you set her up?
I've been to Sapporo.
I told you to get out of here.
We'll do our best.
Would you buy that?
Tom's late for the plane.
She's always getting up early.
Do you want her to help you?
Do you eat rice every day?
We were sitting at the bottom of the audience.
You'll survive.
What did she buy in that store?
When do we have a woman as president?
He came to see you.
I'm glad Tom did it.
I'd buy it.
Did you ever see that movie?
I know what you did last night.
The bus stop is not far from our school.
It's a cookie I baked for you.

I suggest you try harder.
The bark of this dog doesn't scare the baby.
Do not resist.

Why are you avoiding me?
What's going to happen to Tom?
I hope you don't catch a cold.
He's aiming for a bird.
Tom's gonna be released on Monday.
Oh, come on!
I have to move on.
She shook her nose to the glass.
There are no differences between the verbs ser and the estar in English.

He's very secretive.
You have excellent English.
Do I have any messages?
Tom didn't want to cry.
How much time do you have?
It's very dangerous to text a car.
Tom said Mary agreed.
Tom said Mary wouldn't win.
Why did you shave your beard?
I want to go back to this house.
How much lunch do you have?
The black villa was broken.
Why don't you go and kill yourself?
Tom spoke first.
Did you ask Fom to stop?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want Tom to think he should tell me.
I was very calm.
Everyone has something to hide.
We're having a few guests tonight.
Her voice will still be in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you some questions.
Time heals everything.
Why do you always take his side?
We weren't cold.
I saw a cat on the roof.
All men are the same.
Are you hot?
His son is a genius.
Don't miss the case.
Why don't we have dinner tonight at the restaurant?

What else do you want from me?
What did Tom ask you?
I said you came to Australia.

Didn't you tell me you had a brother?
Where am I waiting for you?
I was really worried about you.
What did you find?
Can you explain that to me?

A book on a chair.

What do we lose?
You'd better ask him first.
He was fired against desire.
Take them to the hospital.
Tom told you where he bought his pipe?
She never answered his letter.
I hired someone to work today.
Stop fucking fooling around!
Tom would like us to stay.
I'm up the stairs.
It's the biggest car in the world.
Tom hardly ever asks why.
I have to get back to work.
Tom told me Mary didn't do it that way.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had with him.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
I already did.
What's the weather?
I sent her a message.
You owe me three hundred dollars.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
Can't you introduce me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know that I will always love you.
She said she was ready to do it.
She cried.
I told 'em Mary had to do it.
You're both idiots.
Do you like living outside the city?
How long have you had this time?
We finally have everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm Tom's leader.
Who are you planning to go to Australia with?
Someone was yelling.
What's better?
We thank you for your help.
Go to your room!
I didn't tell him to leave.
What do your parents want for Christmas?
The train leaves at three thirty.
I know you're hiding something.
Release the beast from the cell.
He's scared of cats.
You look like your father.
George is five years older than me.
Give me a cigarette.
Do as you're told.
Please watch this movie.
Someone's calling.
I ran.
Why aren't you ready?
I can't fall in love with your new car.
You shouldn't have done that.
You're much taller than Tom.
You can use his library.

We have to help.
Tom just got out of prison.
Did you tell Tom?
Me!
Tell me what you saw.
I think I found what you're looking for.
Let your uncle think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I've come up with a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you'd do the same for me.
I can't believe Tom did all this.
I don't want to listen to your theories.
Tom already told me what I wanted to know.
In philosophy alone, the vicious circle of evidence can be used and appreciated.
I can't afford to have kids.
When I spoke to them in French in Paris, they were just staring at me, and they couldn't get these bastards to understand their own language.
Should I go?
I was so stupid that I believed it.
She really did.
I think it's very expensive.
I'll open it.
It's been ten hours.
White bread, please.
The owls are nice.
Tom's illiterate.
I think Tom's still out of work.
We're perfect for each other.
French complicated, isn't it?
He doesn't like fish.
The danger has passed.
We need more wood.
Tom said Mary was angry.
Let me know if you need any help.
We have to get there before he does.
He must miss her.
He says he's not sick.
Paris far?
How much time is it in Tokyo?
He said he was hoping to see you.
Tom and I did what they told us.
Frieda Kalo was a Mexican artist.
Nobody knew why.
Jim's not coming tonight.
You'll be a father, you'll understand.
I saw you and Tom last Monday.
Where did you take your shoes off?
We went to the beach.
Do you think there's gonna be snow on Christmas this year?
How was Tom's party?
I need to use the bathroom.
I borrowed one of my friends' tent.
I'll work for you when you pay me so well.
I'd like some coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth at all lately.
You're the only one here who likes Tom.
I know what Tom would do.
You won't get a second chance like that.
Tom immediately agreed to pay the ransom.
All the bills have to pay me.
She's snooping.
Tom said he was looking for you.
We're not as rich as Tom.
Tom's pulling Mary's hair.
Tom didn't seem happy to me.
When I grow up, I want to be a fireman.
Tom eats sushi regularly with his mother.
We forgot to sign up!
Tom said he liked it here.
No, I'm not tired at all.
She's the lazyest thing I know.
Mary's already gone to her room?
This time I'll forgive him.
I really like Chinese food.
It's easier than you think.
Tom wasn't a good coach.
He's a sober man.
Alvaro from Venezuela, he's Venezuelan.
That's the bill.
He publicly insulted me.
Tom won't win anymore.
Why don't I stay with you?
Magnets are used in induction plates for direct heating of castrols and pancakes.
I cried.
Tom wants to learn how to play the trombone.
Get out now.
May I take a look at your rights?
I'll take 1,000 pesetas with you to replace the lightning on these jeans.
How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.
He forgot his sweater.
Tom lives in Australia.
I definitely didn't know where to start.
Remember that!
Only love can break your heart.
I have two tickets to the concert.
I should have gone to Australia with you.
Tom burned out the blanks.
He dictated a few letters to his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in your pajamas?
How much is that?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to take care of the garden.
The cup of rice weighs about one hundred and eighty grams.
I had to leave a note for Tom.
Are you Canadian?
You're stronger than Tom.
I've been waiting for Tom for half a third.
He likes it that way.
Tom knew Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary do it together.
Anyone else notice that?
This proposal is not in English.
I think Tom's a good guy.
She played the sonata.
You can write in any language you want.
The infection's in the blood.
Tom didn't want to buy Mary a present.
Does he know me?
I hate this place.
Someday you'll thank me.
Tom sometimes watches TV.
Am I ready?
I've been waiting for you.
I still have a bad idea.
Run, you chicks!
I saw a terrible dream last night.
It's a huge network.
You got me!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the current situation.
I know what you told her.
I only went to sleep after two o'clock in the morning.
Mary was not thirsty.
So it wasn't as hard to sleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I was trying to wake Tom.
They say that film is very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late because of the heavy rain.
I think she's healthy.
Tom was in a straw hat.
Keep an eye on your brother.
Tom said he wasn't waiting for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you had dinner yet?
I love bitter peppers.
What time do you usually get up on Saturday?
I added milk in coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the 1992 Olympic Games.
I've never betrayed you.
We used to do it together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about money.
There are no invincible ones.
Tom wins.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know Tom can paint.
They're packed.
I didn't know it would be impossible to do that.
Are you having fun?
The man was sentenced to death.
Was it snowed yesterday?
You scared her.
You can't catch Tom.
Did you die on her?
Tom knows French?
He studied Russian when he was young.
Put it back.
Tom and Mary are almost the same age.
I was impressed.
I advise you not to walk.
We didn't discuss it.
Tom poured Mary a cup of tea.
Tom couldn't figure out why no one else wanted to go to the well.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary for self-defense.
How does faith differ from trust?
Tom put the newspaper on the table.
What did you find out?
If the weather permits, we'll go to the top of the mountain tomorrow.
She and I both know him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve a problem.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom was reading an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of the god Ra.
Tom saw it?
The more I thought about the problem, the harder it seemed.
His gray eyes sparkled, and his usually pale face became alive and covered with roman.
What kind of pizza do you love the most?
Tom was standing in front of Mary.
Take some more.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands were cold.
You want to be famous?
Do it carefully.
It's hard for me to solve this problem.
Typhoon destroyed many homes.
This man was sentenced to death.
Call me as soon as you see him.
Can anyone here speak French?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me take your luggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I love you so much, I can't wait to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
Power in Tom's hands.
I learned to work and play as my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me for?
No one's gonna blame you.
I'm not really busy right now.
Children prefer to play rather than learn.
He was accepted as his younger brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my father.
Guess what language I'm talking in.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My boyfriend's a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don't like people who insist on talking about politics.
Is it red or white?
We're not afraid.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Let's go!
Do it before it's dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom's not used to this kind of work.
Bring your wife.
What, did the mustache suddenly get into style?
Tom said he wouldn't want to spend that much time on it.
You're upset.
Our granddaughter was born yesterday.
Tom's costume pirates.
It's pure truth!
Let's go get the Christmas tree.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom should be here in 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll give you a hand.
We are proud of our achievement.
So I had to invite Mary.
Tom had to be punished.
Are you a big fan?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not his girlfriend.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She's become a postman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop hitting the cat!
What were you gonna say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime did you commit?
How do we know that this man is the man he's pretending to be?
King Harald Hormsson, better known as Harald Sinesubee, led Christianity into Denmark.
There's nothing we can do for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
I wish Tom could stay longer.
Almost everyone was dead.
You need to get up early.
Nothing bad happened.
The last few days have been very hot.
He put on a black coat.
I forgot to spill flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.
You're not allowed in this room.
You had other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very gifted and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom bribed Mary?
Tom likes to read German gessa.
Truth be told, I never spoke Portuguese.
When criminal cases reach court, it is generally accepted that there are twelve jurors in the court.
What exactly was Tom doing at the Australian Embassy?
Tom and I started dating.
The boys marched four in a row.
Tom was very puzzled.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very sour.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized something was wrong.
We had no idea Tom was going to do it.
There's another day.
You have to do it right now.
I have to go to the X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He got hurt when he fell.
We're impartial.
I've got mosquito bites all over my hand.
Tom, hurry up, we're gonna be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you following your weight?
Tom's playing trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?
I want her out of my house.
You can't possibly do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonalds is known worldwide for his hamburgers.
Tom made Mary a very expensive gift.
Do you have any opinion?
Do you like those ghosts?
Castle's broken.
Diamond is a gem.
Have a cookie, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Put it down, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come to Boston with us.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How'd you sleep?
I've got a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Maria.
They want it better.
Tom works as a waiter.
It's gonna be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many suffer from low self - esteem?
Was that too simple?
What Alice encountered, waiting for the answer, was a sudden war; it was a loud noise, so sharp as to break its drums, and so loud as to reach the heavens.
I lost him in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he walked into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to leave his job.
That's why you can't go there.
Tom helped take Mary's stuff to the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did is wrong.
A lot of books are published every year.
Tom was reluctant to give Mary the money she asked for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke down.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to hire him.
I've been trying hard to solve the problem.
You should have done your homework.
I spoke on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
That stone was so heavy I couldn't lift it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
He'll be fine. He'll be fine.
We rented canoes.
Have you ever tasted a banana pie?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom great?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look down on the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his own umbrella.
How can we explain this to our children?
I didn't even know your name.
Obezjana's on a tree.
The language I'm learning is very complicated.
Your baby can walk.
Is that all Tom's doing?
I wish I hadn't married her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
Are you really living alone?
I told you I'd come back.
Tom, I have the youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The President has ruled for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have?
Can't you solve that?
And Tom and Mary are here.
Why would he do that?
In the building on the 20th floor.
If you're not coming, I'm not going either.
You don't know when Tom's coming back, do you?
I don't have pictures of Tom.
Can you wait a minute?
Are you going to give something to him for Christmas?
She's not gonna fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes that singer.
If he had followed my advice then, he would have been a rich man now.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There was a strong wind.
Tom didn't have the guts to jump with his parachute.
How do you know all this?
He runs as fast as you do.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time do you plan on being home tonight?
The bag's empty.
Are you all right?
He's stubborn.
I think we can rely on you.
She knew she wasn't right.
It's so cool!
Tom had the feeling that Mary was gonna bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I came home, he was watching TV.
Tom was talking in his sleep last night.
Tom's ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't say that again!
I called him, but I picked up a girl.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell you what you called.
Tom's very hard on the kids.
How are the negotiations going?
He's prepared for the worst.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I mix mayonnaise with ketchup.
They complain forever.
Tom's got a little wire.
Do you understand what she said?
You're kind of distracted.
Don't hurt her.
I'd better stay.
That's why she thought of a brilliant idea.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this a safe place?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe everything's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and clean.
I suspect that that's why we have to go to Boston next week.
Don't go on foreign land.
Tom watched in horror.
Toma's face is gorgeous.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where are you and Tom staying?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How's your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept for him; he always had enough food.
The hall needs a new curtain.
Can you stay with them?
Tom arrived early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it was raining yesterday.
Looks like he's sleeping.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
Her legs hurt.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to discuss something important for both of us.
We need to get you to the hospital.
What is the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Was Tom swimming?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do it often.
I hope we don't do this anymore.
How many times have you helped to do this?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get there, there's gonna be a time of discovery.
I'm not sure how big she is.
He was also good to animals.
Tom and I had dinner together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and walked into the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Foma left the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't help thinking about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire them?
He and I were crying.
Don't you want to try it again?
Wait a little longer.
Why are you so undressed?
Oil, cheese, and much more can be made of milk.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
You're her cousin?
When you drink water, remember those who dug a well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her younger daughter.
Behave yourself.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I smoked before.
You didn't know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt as if I were an unnamed guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, just like everyone expected.
He blinked back.
Tom said Mary was happy.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do it if you try.
You didn't think to ask Tom for help?
It's worth a shot.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you say that in human language?
No one's hungry except me.
Tom is very excited.
No snowman in the snowy avalanche thinks he's guilty.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom to be here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?
I'm going to solve this problem.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
When does the store open?
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
He's opened his mouth wide.
It's spitting.
I really liked this book.
You're important.

Jane asked Mary if she would stay at her place for the night.
Tom didn't tell the police his real name.
I went to school there.
The fish's still raw.
Try to stay positive.
I had a lot of pain.
She strangled him with a pillow.
Look at him.
Is it gonna hurt?
There was a big red hat on the girl.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom was deceived.
I called you here to ask a question.
Who's to play with?
I need a light coat.
I finished my assignment.
It's a cat.
Please tell me that's not true.
Won't you come in?
I repaired his radio.
That's a very bad idea.
Tom's above you.
Tom found a job without a problem.
This book is public access?
Please, can you speak louder?
I'll tell him to contact Mary.
I helped them.
He looks like a girl.
I ask you to address me, not unlike Jacob Matveevich.
She's not alone anymore.
Tom will never admit that he's wrong because he thinks it's a sign of weakness.
I've been to America before.
It's taken longer than I expected.
Mary stayed with her father.
I thought I could trust her.

The moon is an earth’s satellite.
I don't know.
There's nothing in nature that's useless.
No, she never fell in love.
You did it on purpose!
You won't need it.
Tom rarely attends parties.
You're not my mother.
Tell them we're coming.
Do I look like a guy who wants to get married?
I closed the door, but I didn't lock it.
So you should be careful not to kiss Mary publicly.
Can we help them?
Thanks for calling me back.
They're happy.
Please don't be so hard on me.
I'm in charge now!
People who have been good to us all year.
I don't feel sorry for you.
I know Tom won't give up.
I don't really like her.
He's not here.
You're very smart.
Tom and I are planning on getting married on 20 October.
She thought I'd let her down.
I live in Boston now.
Tom took his secret to his grave.
You really want to put your money in that bank?
I don't think anyone else wants to do this.
We're teachers.
You must really like me.
What are you so worried about?
I'll never do it again.
Do aliens exist?
Emily wants to be an electrician.
These books are better than those.
Don't try to remember every proposal in the text, it's almost impossible.

Tom paid Mary a very decent salary.
What do you think of that?
Let's get breakfast quick.
Tom doesn't know why I didn't win.
Never in my life!
Tom ever ask you to help him?
The chair needs to be repaired.
I thought you were right.
Why is everyone looking at us?
Where were Tom's keys?
Did I say your name correctly?
No one saw her leave the room.
Wa-bank.
Tom will never find him.
All women are the same.
He allowed them to walk in the garden.
I don't have a crystal ball.
Your love is false.
She's about my age.
Did you really do it for free?
You want me to open the box?
Boys will always be boys, girls will always be girls.
It's time for you to lie down.
There's nothing new about his drinking addiction.
He's not aware of the risks.
So you don't have to do this anymore.
Do you have any idea who might have done this?
The teacher warned us that the exam would probably be difficult.
I'm a married man.
He bought his son a camera.
Shut up and eat.
I gave you everything.
I'm dedicating this song to you.
I like her better.
You're too young to know what a logarithmic ambulance is.
I've done it almost every day before.
I'm deeply shocked.

I am pleased to inform you that your work has been accepted for publication in SM.
I'm convinced of my right.
I didn't know you wanted to learn French.
Let's go home.
You have time.
I'm not coming.
Tom doesn't spend much time thinking about money.
So we should go with Mary.
I wonder what Tom's doing here.
You're not all-powerful.
I don't think I can go faster.
Tom had some questions.
Are you looking for someone?
Tom's hand bit off a moose.
That's why I didn't have to hide.
He'll be leaving his parents' house soon.
I don't think he'll hear us.
I want to go to England.
Did you see anyone in the park?
Didn't I warn you not to go there?
Tom moved here from Australia three years ago.
She left Boston.
We must consider all options.
Tom could have killed me.

Why didn't someone tell us?
He's in his pajamas.
I went out to find Tom in the lobby.
How old were you when you moved to Boston?
He's more or less aware of his problems.
Tom said he saw UFOs.
I know who you were with.
Tom's got a bike?
What did you ask them?
And the repairs are good.
I eat breakfast every morning.
It's not the bag, it's the fitch.
Are you having trouble with the car?
In the tourist information centre, a map of the city was issued to all those who wanted it.
I'm sorry, but I can't.

Just ignore Tom.
I don't think I'm too biased.
I'm sorry, I didn't notice that.
I teach.
I knew Tom was bluffing.
I've tried my best.
That's a good sign.
Some believe that a guardian angel protects them.
Tom was devastated by his bank account.
She's at the hotel right now.
What am I going to miss?
He was so interested that he paid attention to it.
I told him I wasn't interested.
Tom wants to change society.
I thought you didn't see anything.
We're both here for the same reason.
Love is strong, and money is stronger.
I saw him naked.
There are a lot of children's books in our library.
I didn't let her go home early.
Did you talk to her?
How long will it take to get there?
I didn't mean to disturb you.
We all wished each other good luck.
Tom was born three days before Christmas in 2013.
A young girl was silent.
When Tom heard his favorite song on the radio, he couldn't help but start singing.
When will this be over?
Tom kissed Mary and apologized.
The stain did leave a mark on the skirt.
Is Tom seeing someone?
Tom didn't show me anything.
I hate driving.
They're fake.
When you came back, I left.
Did you talk to him today?
I thought you stopped seeing him.
Tom's calling Mary.
She's hunting flowers.
My wife often calls me when she travels abroad.
You're lying in bed.
First of all, I'd like to make a clear statement on my position.
Tom knows how to play the gang.
Tom didn't decide what to do.
He doesn't like coffee.

We want to go to Australia.
I have a very small salary.

Tom knows where Mary goes.
You scared them.
Tell her to leave.

We've been dating for three months.
I'm glad you were there.
They gave me a big party.
This mountain is covered in snow all year round.
Tom stopped at Mary's shop to buy some sugar.
I like being red.
Stay away from here.
What's the worst movie you've ever seen?
I thought you hated us.
Think nice before you answer.
Tom says Mary needs more time.
I took it for a joke and I didn't answer.
Actually, his name wasn't Tom Jackson.
Is that sarcasm?
Don't do what you regret later.
Do you envy her?
I hope I can stay here a long time.
Payments will be made depending on experience and education.
I think Tom's right.
You don't have to do sports.
Tom told me you were married.
I figured I wouldn't stay.
We look forward to waiting for you and your family.
Did you change it?
I told you I changed my mind.
Why would you say that?
You have to work hard if you want to succeed.
There are no exceptions to the Esperant.
If you need help, tell me.
Can I go home early tonight?
You wouldn't survive.
Tom didn't think Mary would upset it.
There's a commercial area nearby.
Mary thinks she's the smartest.
Use your fist.
Tom doesn't know exactly where Mary lives.
I remember you.
That's interesting news.
Tom's a bitter drunk.
We don't even know her.
Tom made a few suggestions and checked them out on Mary before he poured them on Daddy.
I know where you hide your money.
It's finally over.
It's a long pendant.
Does your mother know about this?
Do you really like this kind of food?
Tom looked in the mirror.
I told them not to tell anyone.
That's how Tom died.
The coffeehouse's empty.
Write a pencil, please.
We can't leave.
He confessed to his crime.
It's the most beautiful painting I've ever seen.
What are you doing here?
Something's bothering him.
At times, Claudia thought about psychoanalysis.
Tom would never agree to that.
You need to find a job.
He'll be back late, too.
She's very proud of herself.
I left about a half-third.
Don't leave a tape in the sun.
I already knew that.
I watched them leave.
I'm surprised you remember them.
Hey, I know you.
"Help me, help me!
Can I open a note?
You had no right to do that.
I'm yours.
He spit exactly as much as he drank.
Let the earth be your downpour, Father!
Why are you still one?
I want us to be friends with your sister.
Who were you waiting for yesterday?
Do you like singing?
The road's slippery.
Tom's cooking breakfast.
Come in.
I'm saving them for my grandchildren.
I heard Carol and Will broke up.
How are you, Tom?
Tom says he's never done it.
Tom seems like a nice guy.
Help me find her.
Tom didn't give it to me.
I had to climb the fence.
The firemen could not contain the flame.
Help is finally here.
It's a horse.
That's what happened here on Monday.
America is done with slavery.
Don't you recognize him?
Fortunately, he didn't die in an accident.
He often sits for hours reading books.
I had no idea you could do that.
Tom unloaded the car.
Tom knew something about Mary that John didn't know.
No answer.
We need to call him.
Are you busy?
I had a bad headache.
Tom, you're on the phone.
You promised not to drink tonight.
Is everything ready for tomorrow?
We checked.
Look what Tom's doing in the garage.
I don't think that's how it works.
I didn't do that.
Tom told me he'd be back.
What time are you coming tomorrow?
A box of holes.
Did you talk to Tom about this?
Is that a bat?
She'll take you to the airport.
Tell me what else I need to know.
You can't make me marry you.
That's pretty weird.
The leaves are yellow.
I woke up and she wasn't.
We have a lot of food today.
He gave a speech in which he supported my view.
Mount Kilimanjaro is a sleeping volcano in Tanzania.
Why don't you go with her?
Why didn't you just tell them?
I can't rule that out.
Tom asked me why I never tried to get my driver's license.
I have to get back to Boston.
Have a seat, please.
Wake Tom up.
Here's a map.
You should have stayed with us.
Suppose we're aliens.
Tom said he wasn't hungry.
I don't have anything to say to you.
I'd rather you didn't tell Tom about it.
I didn't want to go anyway.
I'm not gonna complain.
They kept their love secret.
She rushed to the train station only then to be late for the train.
Don't tell that to my bride.
Tom is tired of paying the bill every time he and Mary go on a date.
I strongly recommend that you reconsider your decision.
I'm not worried about your past.
The police searched Tom's car.
Although I felt like something was weird, I didn't know it was.
You're a pig?
I went to the army.
Why can't you accept me as I am?
Bear's black.
Tom doesn't know what Mary did.
I don't know who's going to be at the meeting.
It's hard for the President to approach.
If you're hungry, eat.
I was so scared.
He's no longer a member of our club.
I'll take care of it right now.
I don't trust her.
Six three is equal to eighteen.
Skala is an anagram of grace.
I've never seen Tom help anyone.
Dan attended a rally against racism.
You did it fast.
I need two minutes ahead of me.
He's on her side.
I haven't forgotten your betrayal.
I think you did great.
She danced so gracefully that she surprised us all.
This is where she worked as a secretary.
They're not that bad.
I thought I had everything.
Don't worry, it'll be all right.
I'm having a hard time working with Tom.
I'm competitive.
He says his son can count to 100 now.
There's something wrong here.
Tom hates these things.
There's a little garden in front of my house.
Why didn't they go?
I heard you paid someone to do it.
This is for my friend.
Tom said Mary was innocent.
Tulip is the official flower symbol of our prefecture.

I didn't want to lose him.

I'm gonna give you some karate lessons.
Don't worry about my dog.
Tom's cremated tomorrow.
That's not true.
You're not allowed to do this anymore.
On summer vacations in Caruidsavu, tourists were caught.
I saw Tom get on the train.
He didn't do anything wrong.

It was just water.
I bought it for my sister.
I'll never forget the time we went to Hawaii with her.
Nobody heard the call.

Tom's quite happy.
I didn't want it to be the same with me.
I don't know all students.
Thank you so much, you just ruined my life.
Dead civilians.

He did what you asked him to do.
Excuse me, where are the eggs?
Peace be upon you.
I've got a white one.
Tom is a cruel businessman.
I can't go on Saturday.
We're getting married in October.
Tom and Mary disagree with you.
We'll see you soon.
Let's get a divorce.
He's not gonna find the keys.
Her manner of speaking makes me nervous.
That's what he likes.
And then what happened?
You think he likes me?
Tom agreed to help Mary do it.
He prefers not to talk about it.
I let them sleep by noon.
I just wanted to get back to my old life.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I've already said everything you should know about it.
Health gives a person freedom that most people don't realize until she's left.
Is that important?
I know Tom's secret.
Tom is a man.
That's ridiculous.
No one could believe that.
Tell her I'll fix the fridge.
That's not surprising.
The rabbit's bleeding out of his ear.
Postmodernism differs from modernism.
I've read this book before.
Damn it!
He's very enthusiastic.
Maybe you should call the police.
Did you report this to the police?
You really think Tom's sick?
I'm not afraid of that at all.
I don't have as much money as you think.
I sell clothes on the Internet.
I could do it faster when I was younger.
I wasn't worried.
John, the tallest boy in our class, is called Mr. High.
Tom leaves tomorrow morning.
I didn't kill them.
Do you recognize him?
I mean, I didn't care.
Tom has a horse.
I shouldn't have come here.
Don't make such a sour face!
It's white?
Tom's here first.
Strange rumors were about them.
That's amazing.
The sky is covered in clouds.
This bird is at risk of extinction.
You've made her very happy.
How are you?
Tom didn't look like he was having fun.
I'm all over my throat.
You said it was important.
He said he'd be back right now.
They have a lot of information.
Everyone in the village called her Green Hat.
I don't want to.
It's time to put the kids to bed.
You can get sick of this job.
I had a rest.
Tom won't mind.
Nothing.
I'm afraid you have no choice.
Did you take the medicine?
Many people believe in the corruption of our country's officials.
Did he take off his pants?
I can't tell him from my brother.
We can count on him.
I'll go with her.

I really need someone to rub.

I want you to stay away from Tom.
Tom just got out of prison.
The entrance with the animals is cleared.
Tom's full of hope.
He speaks French and, of course, English.
Move that stone over there, please.
"Tom marries." "And who's the lucky one?"
I've been thinking about you all day.
That's good news.
I can't pay you.
That's what I found in the cave.
I think I made an impression on him.
The train's been at this station for about two minutes.
Grow up, Tom.
I want to sleep with your wife.
Where do you think the safest place would be?
I know your father.
I heard you screaming.
He's the boy who painted this painting.
"Call up" means call.
Who'd notice?
Medicines should only be used when instructed by a doctor.
Do you have a question?
They went into the woods.
I talk too much.
You show me the way.
The sun shines brightly.
Coral reefs are life-sucking.
Tom said he knew what Mary was planning to do.
You never wanted to talk about it.
We hope for the best.
I didn't expect Tom and Mary to be here.
Last night the temperature went down below zero.
"You can't wear it." "Why not?"
Tom didn't do it well.
I knew Tom wasn't in Australia.
My eyes are the ocean where my dreams are reflected.
In a big city like Tokyo, I prefer walking, not riding on a car.
As it turns out here, it's impossible to know now.
Now Tom has his own room.
I didn't know her first.
Many voices were fabricated.
You lied to us, didn't you?
I don't think Tom can help you right now.
He'll probably be here soon.
He had no idea what a differential equation was.
I know that for sure.
Be a grown-up, Tom.
Can you tell Tom from his twin brother?
I don't get paid for that.
Tom ripped off the sex boards with a crowbar.
Don't get high.
How did you know where Tom was?
She says she'll do it on Monday.
Tom eats too fast.
The popularity of the phone has led to fewer people writing letters today.
I think we're almost ready.
A woman came to our town three years ago.
Is that why you won't help us?
My daughter died, and I'm terribly upset.
She's taller than my sister.
I have a pink car.
So quiet.
In the most beautiful colors, the sharpest spikes.
You'd better hide.
It should be indicated.
It's just not gonna happen.
They can't afford it.
What color do you like?
She says she feels very obsessive.
It doesn't matter.
Tom had a happy childhood.
I just got back from Boston.
Why did Tom run away?
Tom doesn't know what Iraq is different from Iran.
That's why they told me not to do it.
Two days ago, I got a cold.
I've been waiting for him.
You don't have to do this.
Let's have a cup of coffee or something.
You have something in your pockets, don't you?
Ask Tom, he'll tell you the same thing.
He saw that helicopter himself, and he took it out with his hands.
I'm with you.
You want to end up like him?
I've been thinking about him.
I'm waiting for someone.
Are you going to the theater tonight?
You have to protect yourself.
There's no air conditioning in my house.
Tom and Mary are studying French together.
My boss is very happy today.
They blocked his offer.
I admire your courage.
Tom hoped that Mary would stay in Boston for a while.
Don't make me do it again.
It's your turn soon, Bashar!
You're a pain in the ass.
It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
I visited Boston.
Excuse me, could you repeat the question?
What do you think they're gonna do with Tom?
Ask Tom when Mary will do it.
I don't want anyone to.
Tom's gonna be working this weekend.
Please tell her I called.
No one could see us.
I knew I'd find you with Tom.
Attempts by the President to introduce stricter arms control once and for all crossed the influential weapons lobby.
I think we know each other.
You underestimate Tom.
Don't bother Tom.
I'll try to say it in English.
Give it to me, please.
We need to talk to her.
You have enough time.
We had to plan harder.
You need to sleep.
I'm proud that my father is a good cook.
Is there anything else you want to tell me?
Foma tried to explain the situation to Masha.
I told her it was a mistake.
He's her manager.
Tom didn't have it.
No one paid attention to me.
That's why there were thirteen at the time.
I'm going to Boston on a bus.
Tom wants to try a new shampoo.
Tom grew up in these places.
You have to pay first.
Did you make coffee?
You could have told the truth.
She's just thinking about herself.
You're usually talking too fast.
We're both speaking French.
Find yourself a nice suit.
Who told you where to find me?
Who likes Tom?
That's definitely not what I wanted.
How did you break your shoulder?
Tom hid the fact that he was in prison.
We're bigger than Spartacus!
That's how he celebrated it.
Why was he needed by Toma?
It's a capital injection.
It's really bitter.
It's been a while.
Did I say something funny?
Where's the ring?
Meg didn't even look at me.
Promise?
I know you did it on purpose.
It's time to know.
I have to call him.
There's a lot to think about.
You've always been a winner.
The network!
I used to live on Park Street.
Try to be there on Monday.
I've read this before.
It's thanks to you.
Until certain conditions are met.
She's not like everybody else.
Social networks provide a lot of information about a person before they meet him.
What really happened last weekend in Boston?
What is the meaning of learning?
These peaches aren't very sweet.
I don't think these black spots can be removed.
I told you everything I should have told you.
No, I didn't.
Let me pay you.
I can't forgive his flax.
Tell me you're kidding!
I'm realistic.
I heard Tom was expelled from school.
Tom said he was very lonely.
I didn't tell my friends I was going to Australia.
Kim is four years older than me.
Why aren't you in shape?
Tom just wanted to make sure that's what you meant.
Tom sent his daughter to bed without dinner.
I'm coming with you.
They cleared the streets of the snow.
Tom and Mary should do it together.
They offered us their help.
Tom's determined to kiss Masha.
Are you very hungry?
What's gonna happen to him?
Tom and I are mystery friends.
Where do you think you're going?
I had blood in my urine.
You can't always win.
Tom's got some sort of celebrity.
Jimmy knows all about cars.
I've seen them all.
As everyone knows, he's a genius.
The picture is hanging on the wall.
Mary said she'd win.
I want this dog.
Tom with you?
The boy's afraid of the dark.
I made Toma's dinner.
Russia became the second super-Power.
I'm worried about them, too.
He went to the post office to send a letter.
Spend the powder in a cup of water.
Will you go with her?
Let's take one of those ready lunches that's sold at the train station.
Tom tried to kill them.
She says she's happy.
You want to go abroad?
Don't blame the government.
Put him in place.
How come you know each other?
Who sent this letter?
Drop your guns.
What happened to the money?
The average rent for an apartment in Manhattan is about four thousand dollars a month.
You won't find them.
Tom is the only one who survived.
You're gonna buy that car?
You sound like my grandmother.
I don't have any siblings.
Let's see something else.
You think it's accurate?
I know Tom kissed Mary.
We both really wanted to eat.
So there's nothing to do here.
Try not to worry about us.
Stop right there!
You've been very helpful.
Don't knock on the door with your hand.
You must take his age into account.
I forgot to tell her something.
We forgot you don't like pizza.
Tom was beginning to suspect something was wrong.
What if he comes back now?
If you're tired, you're asleep!
I'm afraid I won't have time.
You didn't know Mary was Tom's wife?
I need to move on.
Tom and Mary stopped kissing.
We're going to lunch on Friday.
What's your dad's name?
Can't you turn off the radio?
I definitely don't remember what Tom said.
Tom's an experienced player.
I wasn't ready for that.
Look at that girl.
Tom's got a living imagination.
He's got a broken neck.
What are you talking about?
Yesterday, you left the bar just the moment I was going to put all the drinks on my tab.
Tom told me it actually works.
I want to play chess.
I support you 100%.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
You should tell her how you feel.
I have a slight headache.
I heard about what happened.
We rarely have snow here.
Don't open that box.
I hate waiting.
I see him at the club sometimes.
Tom asked Mary why she was crying.
It was fun last night.
Where did Tom get these photos?
It's useless to panic.
Hey, you know what?
I've been in Boston for three days.

Who are you to decide?

We'll try to stay calm.
Tom's in the park with his friends.
She spoke fast.
So you shouldn't have fooled Mary.

I'd like to speak to you alone.
I thought you weren't seeing him anymore.
This magazine is good for sale.
Her clothes got a lot of attention at the party.
They're getting married tomorrow.
She was right, and he's wrong.
They drew lots to go first.
Maybe we should ask him the way.
Fortunately, it worked.
Tom won't call.
He said he was cold.
I like spending time with my friends.

This news is new to me.
Tom wants you to help him do it.
She's got a very busy schedule.
Tom also speaks French.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
Tiger lilies were planted in the garden.
I told her not to do it.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do that.
We came to wish you good luck.
Do you remember his name?
Tom put toys in a toy box.
I don't want you to go.
He said he'd come.
"Doctor, everyone ignores me." "Follower!"
He's got one purpose in life, making money.
He gave the dog a piece of meat.
There's a letter for you.
Tom's grandfather couldn't read.
I'm not a doctor, I'm a teacher.
She said she liked him.
Do I have to go with you?
Give him the mike.
Tom stayed at the hotel for the night.

I want you to come with her.
I'll make him pay the money.
You must respect them.
I'm waiting for you in Turin!
You didn't look tired.
I will pray earnestly.
What will you do if war starts again?
Tom said he'd do that, too.
I'm not going to Australia this year.
The most famous gold fever is the California gold fever, which began in 1848.
Do you know why Tom doesn't trust Mary?
Show me your picture.
I meet new people every day.
I want to go on a date with him.
You let Tom down.
What are you doing in my room?
We miss Tom terribly.
He replied to his parents.
Tom, have you eaten yet?
Who did you give it to?
I held him by the collar.
No one's asking you to do this.
I forgot that this is April 1st.
Please stop singing that song!
Thomas bit the dog.
I know you left early.
Tom's been doing this all morning.
I'm aware of the consequences.
In the eastern and western parts of the city, the river divides.
Why are you jumping?
Do you know anyone who speaks French?
Is that why it was scary?
Tom invited me to stay the night.
I don't think Tom's guilty.
I'd really like you to stay.
I'm impressed with your French.
We both want to do it.
If the ice is heated, it's growing.
We could have done that.
The doctor said that Toto needed surgery.
I just changed the toothpaste.
Here's something for you.
This is your bedroom.
Tom's realistic.
Who's knocking at my door?
When and where did you meet Tom?
I've come to visit you.
I feel like an amoboy.
Our team has returned home with a triumph.
I went alone.
Tom married an older girl.
I listened to him.
Why aren't you sleeping?
He came to you with a guarantee?
Can you take a picture of us?
I heard you crying.
Show me how to do it!
Everybody's quiet.
Let the dust settle.
Why are you so stubborn?
But with all these hormonal things, he's been staring at almost every other person he sees.
I'm happy to let you know that I'm completely cured.
I've written a lot of proposals on the esperant.
I like Aquarelle better than a pastel.
I can't make an exception.
He's a quick thinker.
I can find them.
I'm here now.
You have the right to a lawyer.
Don't sit too close to the TV.
I'm my head almost every day.
To my surprise, he didn't give up his credit.
You stole it?
She must be mad at me.
You don't understand, Tom.
My father loves fishing, as do I.
Hey, it's me.
Dan has shown himself to be a supporter of the white race.
I'll try to distract them.
I like the color of your shirt.
It's not me, I swear!
I don't think Tom speaks French.
My parents wouldn't understand.
I don't know what to do.
She asked me if she could use the phone.
Tom's cooking better than I am.
He swims like a cannon.
Tom didn't tell Mary he had to buy it.
She brought a broom.
"Tom, hurry up." "I'm coming!"
I have a big problem.
We're not partners.
We have already faced this problem.
I'll try to say it in French.
I'm not like everyone else.
I managed to get two tickets to a concert.
He likes bragging about his father's successful car business.
She's in sunscreen.
Come on, Amelia, your father's waiting for you.
How many hours can you sit in front of a computer?
Tom can barely walk.
Minus per minus gives you a plus.
In the basement.
Please make a donation.
I really need to talk to you.
Tell me nothing.
I prefer to travel alone.
Ankara is the capital of Turkey.
I went to the bakery.
I prefer a simpler approach.
They're great.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
Jane’s farewell speech saddened us greatly.
I try not to read the news.
What am I supposed to tell him?
You look stunned.
I'm grateful for your help.
He couldn't contain the smile.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
I wasn't trying to kill them.
Education is a recognition that you didn't even know you didn't.
Tom agreed to help Mary.
You should've thought about it before you got her pregnant.
Tom says he's not marrying Mary.
I caught two fishes.
I think Tom's sick.
Tom's gone pale.
I'm not poor.
Professor Hudson is my father's friend.
Can I come, too?
Is Tom making enough money to live in the city?
Interrogation's over.
Please turn off the radio.
He didn't seem so sure of his answers.
I heard rumors about Tom and Mary.
Take off your jacket if you're warm.
There's so many of them.
He could not compromise the principles.
Mary says she's lonely.
You'll probably be out of here for three hours.
It was an easy decision.
Mary said she'd come early.
I want to open my own restaurant.
Are you still buying lottery tickets?
It could be anything.
One language is never enough.
Mary told me she was Canadian.
You seem to be suffering.
Tom forgot to tell Mary about the party.
That's what people don't understand.
Tom is endowed with a rich imagination.
Finally, she solved the problem.
The main thing is to tell the truth.
I don't want Tom singing at our wedding.
It's all about work.
I had nothing wrong with my mind.
Tom keeps his room clean.
These three books belong to Tom.
He jumped from one topic to another.
It's a truce.
You told him I was here?
Tom's coming in.
It's not cold today.
I put Tom's shirt on by mistake.
Looks like the bank robbery was planned right up to the crumbs.
That's why he didn't like it, but he bought it anyway.
Stay a little longer.
I want to talk to you about something.
The bank's empty.
Why didn't you show her to Tomo?
Isn't the weather great?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I bathed in the river.
Tell them to take the phone off.
Can you tell us what it is?
Say no to racism.
Tom's a butcher, isn't he?
Don't make me kill you!
What do you like better, this one or that one?
They don't respect him.
There's no choice.
I want you to be my girlfriend.
Don't be angry with us.
You can't answer that.
Tom's got a lot of books.
Can you tell the alligator from the crocodile?
Wait, what's that?
My grandfather built this house.
Do you want to take this opportunity?
You can't stay here.
I did it for the first time today.
I came to Australia when I was a kid.
You really want me to tell you because you killed his father?
I got a call from your teacher.
I'm your father.
Can I do it myself?
The whole nation was touched by his speech.
Do you know how dangerous it is?
He's running.
He's sitting next to his brother.
I'd like to meet him.
How old is Tony?
Can I take a shower in the morning?
All right, everybody, listen up, please.
Is it made of wood or of metal?
Excuse me!
I consider Tom to be my friend.
Counting on being ignorant and free, the nation is counting on what has never been and will never be.
Tom's barely breathing.
Dogs don't know color.
Tom poured water out of the bottle before filling it with fresh water.
Dogs are faithful animals.
Tom's house was almost completely destroyed.
You're so stupid.
Tom knows you can't speak French?
Two boats on the lake.
I'm not gonna call you her name.
I knew it was a lie.
It's better to be alone than in a bad company.
That's not correct.
There is a marked difference between them.
I know some of you think Tom's lazy.
We have to tell him not to do this again.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he's making a appearance.
Come closer.
We stopped at the Hilton Hotel.
So you should tell Mary the truth.
I'll be alone after you're gone.
Tom wanted to open the box right away, but I offered to wait for Mary.
She always complained that there was no money left.
Don't you think you should call Tom?
There's something I need to do.
She gave him a gift.
Mary's in her room.
Attention!
The second I fell in love with that language.
Tom's safe, isn't he?
Did you order that pizza?
I need you to help me with this.
Tom is a close friend of mine.
Don't do two things at the same time.
You shouldn't have walked into the woods alone.
No one sees my tears.
Tom fell asleep again.
She really likes you.
I'm glad you're still here.
These bottles are repeated.
Tom's never kissed anyone before.
I'll tell them you came in.
I'll listen.
I haven't been home since October of the month.
I'm very happy to meet you.
I almost forgot about the meeting.
They had a wedding last fall.
He's helping me.
Put your hands up!
Everyone knows we didn't do it.
I thought Tom had never been to Boston.
She learned to dive when she was five.
We complained to the manager about the noise from the neighbors.
I won't let you do that.
I don't think they heard us.
I thought you might need this.
Honesty is one of the virtues.
When you see the new year, you'll see it through.
There's no book in the library in French.
Any summation is dangerous, especially this.
You could have stayed in Boston.
There's nobody there.
Can you write this with a hurricane, please?
We don't think it matters.
No one understands you as I do.
Act like it's your age.
Can you juggle?
Did you kill your wife?
We exchanged greetings.
Tom still wants to come.
I thought they weren't coming.
I'm not carrying the kind of animal suffering.
I think Dadeba's stalling tonight.
Sally made her brother clean the toilet.
Mary's apartment is a mess.
Conference room's busy now.
Potato chips are bad for your health.
Mine's not as good as yours.
I look forward to Christmas.
I've never seen you so happy.
He took a deep breath.
I think Tom's right.
It's a mess.
Do you see a star?
Ask Tom.
Grab the rope!
You've said so many times.
Tom says he's not hungry.
That's always been the case.
Can't we fire her?
The artificial satellite was launched into orbit.
I'm totally serious.
Are you sure you're sick?
It's too simple.
What happens to our children if nuclear war starts?
I told them the bank didn't work.
Tom and I soon became friends.
He has a question.
I thought Tom was your best friend.
I'm very sorry about that.
There's nothing to tell me what to do.
Papers on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know that.
Tom didn't tell us why he was so upset.
I knew it was him.
Tom's working.
I don't work today.
That's what you said last time.
I know it better than anyone.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
I knew it was something like that.
You don't have anything to hide, do you?
You're lying to me.
Tom looked very young.
The bill must be paid by the first number of the following month.
My French is terrible.
We need help.
You're scaring her.
For me, Boston is a cold city, not Chicago.
Tom was the victim of an attempted extortion.
I can't speak for my colleagues.
Tom lives far away from you?
Why didn't I die?
The fight ended with a fight.
I didn't take it.
Tom came by yesterday.
I'd like to keep my review.
You chose the wrong man.
They were taking a great risk.
We have a white cat.
You may never be able to walk again.
He used to be better.
Tom wants to see us.
You weren't home last night?
If anyone can do that, Tom.
They canceled the meeting because of the typhoon.
Tom was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2013.
There was a carriage with mules on the way.
Tom and his grandparents speak French and English with their parents.
I don't think Tom has enough money to buy a ticket.
It was not easy to find Tom.
Everybody dances!
I live with Tom.
That's where I met them.
You're not wasting your time.
Your problem is you don't have enough patience.
Several events marked the beginning of the twenty-first century.
Stop doing that, Tom.
Tom said he wasn't planning on doing it.
This university was founded by Mr. Smith.
I told him to go to Australia.
I think you could do that.
Tom said there's no way to talk about it.
He got out of bed.
Trains follow schedule.
I paid for Tom.
There are many people who think it is impossible not to get confused in languages.
Why is Tom avoiding me?
Is there an exam today?
What motivates you?
Sammy gave Leila his computer back.
Put the sleeves on.
I was hoping you'd come back.
You think Tom's gonna agree to meet us?
They say that in America anyone can become president, but that's not really true.
Tom never forgot Mary.
The first on the list is Tom's name.
What else did you miss?
Mary tried to calm down.
What time does the train arrive?
What time does this train arrive in Boston?
Didn't you see that?
You need to call me.
Tom never suspected that Mary and John were dating each other.
When I get rich, I'll buy a farm.
I baked him a cookie.
It's a neighboring country.
I called my son.
Why didn't she come yesterday?
Where can I sit?
You won't believe what Tom told me!
I'll give you some more time to think.
Put that into French, please.
Take the cold steel!
She needs a cab.
The crowd rose rapidly.
Mary told me she loved me.
Tom told me what happened.
Hair and stick.
I'll find her.
Did you think about what I said?
I'm very cold.
We're looking for you!
She loves everyone.
Compare your answers with Tom's responses.
Tom has a weak heart.
So you have to pay for it.
I didn't know what to buy.
Can you lend me a pocket knife?
Tom took off his pregnant beard.
Have you seen my dog?
Don't even try to do it yourself.
Nobody saw you take it.
I'm half Japanese.
Tom says he'll fix it.
You have to come back.
We've already talked.
I can't believe I finally made it.
Tom didn't know why Mary was sad.
Don't worry, it's a light test.
Why don't you just tell me?
What month is the thirteenth?
I don't know what book to choose.
Tom didn't understand anything.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's wearing a white boyish shirt.
It's a tower.
I have to wait.
Yesterday was Sunday, not Saturday.
Anybody here know them?
They're watching you.
How much time do you need?
I think Tom remembered me.
We can do that.
He knows his flaws.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary dressed in a black dress.
We had lunch at the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom never asks for help.
Tom didn't say that to Mary.
It's okay.
There are many broad avenues in this city.
What the hell are you doing?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to marry next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find the hotel.
She's not stronger than me.
You haven't told Tom yet, have you?
She's got a double chin.
We can't make the people do it.
Let me carry it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I can't stand that color.
Are they sleeping together?
We're very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's still not married.
I didn't even know what you knew.
I won't let her in.
Our neighbors were sorry for us.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot a bear.
I've never spoken to Tom.
I'm just saying that we can't trust Tom.
She's got flaws.
I wonder why it's necessary.
That seems suspicious to me.
I'll pretend you didn't say that.
What are you doing Friday night?
Tom's not the only one here from Boston.
Will you back me up?
Why don't you like the plan?
I thought you were at work.
It's up to you to decide.
Are you ready to have fun?
Are you a friend or an enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
Winter will be over soon.
Titles and prizes don't mean anything to me.
Where did you find him?
The meeting's too long.
I'll recognize you.
Did you have a good weekend?
Tom drinks beer.
You don't want to do it, don't do it!
Tom had a good job.
Is it good or not?
You don't remember anything?
I need cash.
Bring Tom a drink.
What do you want to eat this weekend?
Pull yourself together!
Tom wants to be rich and famous.
She smiled at me.
He's afraid we'll get lost.
I can't call him home.
You should have apologized to Tom for your rude behavior.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
The boy ran to his home.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Tom was a cab driver when he lived in Boston.
Tom seems optimistic.
He's not gonna buy a camera.
I've done everything I can to help him.
I'm connecting you to her.
She received the highest grades.
Tom might be a little nervous.
I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What color is your childhood associated with?
I left in a hurry.
I work for the benefit of society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do it.
I was a little scared.
Tom took advantage of himself as a doc.
I'd like to lie down.
Give me some notes or something.
I want to relax in front of the TV tonight, and I don't want to leave the house.
He'll be here tonight.
The cat's dead.
Is it only half the ninth now?
Tom went to the store to buy milk.
I'm not allowed to talk to Tom.
I don't mind if you smoke.
It's not safe to swim in this lake.
I cut my finger last night.
Tom wanted to have lunch with me tonight.
Tom doesn't look so good.
She blew herself up to warm them up.
Tom said he was glad you came back.
My car is covered in blue shit.
Tom doesn't know I exist.
Tom found Mary's door open.
Lori home?
I decided to marry Tom.
I'm not going to make this mistake again.
I don't care if we stay or not.
I arranged for her to marry him.
I've been waiting my whole life for this day.
What did they do to you?
Did he pass the test?
The plane's in the middle of nowhere.
It wasn't him.
Do you have any correspondence friends in Indonesia?
You may have to help her.
Mary's lost consciousness.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Will you come to the concert with me?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had time, I'd love to visit you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where are your probes?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do this for you.
"Hi," the slave said to Tom.
Where are you going?
I almost died yesterday.
I'm in pain.
She didn't have any food.
I don't think Tom knows how long.
They're running away.
The road does not correspond to the number of vehicles passing through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
Attack!
Look at the price tag.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any other questions?
A new proposal as a message in a bottle: one day it will be transferred.
You're not gonna find a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
Everyone loved you.
We're related souls with him.
I have a granddaughter of your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I've never worked with her.
She started taking over in her new office.
Let us take care of this.
I believe you're sitting in my seat.
I was planning on doing it yesterday.
It's a little early to drink, isn't it?
My parents don't like the way I dress.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.
That'll be interesting.
I hit him hard and hard.
Because it's worse?
That's not very good.
Can I take your hand?
It's green.
Tom heard a noise.
Tom gave Mary his number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom didn't lie down all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about kissing.
The show's got to start watching all seasons go away!
Road accidents occur daily.
Where did you go to ski?
Were you in hairdresser?
Prospects are shocking.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me the balloon pen.
The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I haven't slept two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You need to find another way out of this situation.
Get out of here.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's take a picture together.
I failed the exam.
Everyone already knew about it.
You'd better go help her.
The football player made a huge mistake.
Are they coming, too?
She sleeps like a baby.
Tom forgot to let the brake go.
This song reminds me of a girl.
Come on, Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
The blast hit the whole building.
Tom kissed Mary, and they hugged her.
That's my cat.
Do you have any children yet?
Tom didn't want breakfast.
They like Tomo.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
Tom is a self-sufficient idiot.
It won't let me sleep at night.
He was transferred to another department.
I suppose you need help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let the cat out.
I know you're all shorts.
Tom thinks throwing out food is a sin.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place bends right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom about it yet?
I'll never listen to you again.
I have no doubt.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved considerably.
Let's go to church.
Tom took the whiskey.
Was it hard?
He's reacting.
I've never met him before in my life.
How much was he worth?
I need to see you right now.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
Sharks eat fish.
I'm the same as I used to be.
Do you know the boy who's crying?
No one knew about it.
That's just amazing.
He said he'd never do it.
The stealer steals the cow.
Tom doesn't swim well, does he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was only a shadow of the past.
How do we do that?
I can't believe Tom really won't come with us to Boston next week.
Don't let them in.
Everything happens.
What day is it?
Let's give it another chance.
I just want you to accept me as I am.
I'm just a regular guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Did Paul kiss Lily in the lip?
Why don't you go over there?
Tom never said he'd come with us.
Tom died the day after.
Tom and I have to stick together.
I've only heard of him as a good one.
I don't work here anymore.
Which one do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
You can't be like us.
I saw the car explode.
The window is here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'll never leave my Playstation.
I don't want Tom to see me like this.
Stay calm!
What's your favorite TV show?
You want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Tom's suitcase is empty.
Oh, my God, it's on fire!
I'm afraid you'll get lost.
I love going to school.
I offered to help.
I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
Thank your son for me.
I think her father's a lawyer.
I want to see a volcano.
I know the owner.
Your dog.
What do you mean?
There's nothing you can do about it.
Tell him that I'm going to go home to him this afternoon.
They need you.
It's orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Don't you see what happened?
I didn't want to bother him.
The officer gave his men courage.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm thinking about trying things like that right now.
I don't know much about hunting.
It's the first time I've made grilled meat at home.
You're avoiding me.
Why did they do it?
Tom would apologize to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many probes do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
Everyone knew that already.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You mustn't lie.
I know Tom's about to cry.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
She may have said so.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw the way he looked at you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom should be home.
She was the one I was thinking about.
Tom showed the police his driving rights.
I cut my hair every month.
I told you, I don't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
It's an apple of acid.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new catalog.
That must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go too.
Are you taking the job home?
According to mythology, Prometheus took the sacred fire from the gods.
Welcome to the world of physics.
I wish we could spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All the passengers managed to get off the bus before it got hot.
I want to help you figure this out.
You speak French better than me.
There are a lot of talented people in our town, but Tom doesn't apply to them.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We accept checks.
My bike's gone.
The stars died in the night sky.
I doubt Tom's gonna win.
“Eh, here you are so bored.” “My little boy, to this world, is seeking all...” — “Here I am! Your Majesty, Ganon and his servants have taken the island of Coridai.” — “Hm-h-h-h-h-h-h-h—we can” — “Linck alone can conquer Gannon.” — “So we can.” — “I will catch my sword!” — “No sword!” — “No!” — “No!” — “No!” — “No!” — “No!” — “No!” — “No!” — “No!” — “No!” — “No!” — “No!” — “No!” — “No!”
Do you know who sings this song?
Is your time going right?
I'll see you Sunday at 3:00.
I was at your wedding.
Tom can barely swim.
You're doing great.
I met her on the way home from school.
I haven't read any of his novels.
Everyone knew Tom was dying.
Where's the hammer you used?
Tom wanted to learn how to read.
I'm on my way home.
Ken couldn't remember his name.
She said she needed money.
Tom helped Mary put the blankets down.
A is a set consisting of elements c, b and a.
I'll be back by 9:00.
He's diabetic.
We can deal with them.
I was just wondering if you had any experience you'd like to share with us.
Tom slept without a blanket.
Pray for us.
What kind of music are you listening to in the car?
I was told that three hours ago.
Take mine.
The French Revolution began at the time of Louis XVI.
He was curious.
He loved us.
Did you get an invitation from Tom?
I want to swim at sea.

Her death was a powerful blow to him.
She's busy right now, so she can't talk to you.

I got married early.
It's not a bug.
I don't want to scare you.

Everybody loves money.
They got lost in the woods.
When was the last time you ate?
My heart hurts.
My father won't let me go to the movie alone.
I saw the boat sink.

If you come to Toto right now, you'll probably stop watching his TV.
I saw you in the park with Tom.
I didn't mean to offend them.
I'd better go look for them.
My motorcycle broke down on the road.
Tom made a selfie without a shirt.
Whose kingdom was this church built in?
Soon we can put you in jail.
I'm starting to think you're serious.
I'm not coming back.
I'm sure Tom would be happy to help.
It's Joanna.
I've made so many mistakes.
How can people do such things?
So I'm really sorry.
I like your glasses.
The rainwater is pouring through this pipe.
I always thought Tom was a close friend.
I'm one of those girls who's more friends with guys.
Don't worry, I have insurance.
Tom will be here with me.
It's hard for my father to stop drinking.
No one's suggesting that you do it.
He works for this company from Monday to Sunday.
Mary forgot to close the car.
I'm old.
Tom left with Mary.
Tom started laughing.
I'll call Tom tomorrow.
Tom has telepathic abilities.
Who's he by nationality?
Tom was in the same cell with John.
I didn't want to swim.
He drank beer.
In our time, it's hard for a man to be... himself.
I'll never talk to him again.
Shh, Thomas, wake up!
I'm going to shrink my nostrils.
I did what I promised to do for them.
I'm a new teacher.
They're all children.
She came out and yelled at me.
Did you take your medicine?
Honeymoons are very nice.
She doesn't trust him.
Time's on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
Do you like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
Is there something you wanted to tell me?
I doubt Tom's still mad.
You'll feel better in the morning.
What do you want to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Do you smell a burnt rubber?
That's not what happened here.
When will your father come home?
I understand.
Tom ran the book for Mary.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of the shower.
Tom's got a patient.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom and Mary are not married.
Tom's trying to escape.
You're obviously tired.
We're champions.
Tom's going deaf.
Tom said it wasn't enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring salad to the party.
Her hair is wet from the sweat.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom sat on the floor between the door and Mary.
How do you know how much it weighs?
The shipyard is a master of compliments.
Tom's married Mary, isn't he?
All the pebbles in the park were busy.
Someone has to tell her that.
I've got it all working out.
Vermont is on the border with Canada.
He had to live in the same room with his brother.
I didn't imbecile.
You're gonna fix it, aren't you?
I can't hunt.
He's got a brother in Tokyo.
Dynamite invented Alfred Nobel in 1857.
We have to intervene.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
You can go if you want.
I know you shouldn't do that.
I suggest you let them go.
Take my glasses.
I've already spoken to this student.
What is the chemical sign of bromohydrogen acid?
We have a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
I asked Tom.
That's why we need to talk to a lawyer.
I think you should do it.
Cool!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed like a janitor.
I respect his views, although I disagree with many of them.
The skyscraper is in the center of town.
Who sent you?
She tied him a sweater.
I don't think Tom wants to go to Boston with you.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
Call cheap after nine?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You're not using them, are you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We didn't get a chance to win.
Are you planning on staying long?
We had to eat and left at the same time.
There's a big garden in the back of the house.
You're stubborn.
Careful, don't hit anything on your feet.
Start each meal with soup.
I'm afraid to be alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right against me.
The cage was opened.
I brought some wine.
I'm unpopular.
It's his first day at school.
I want to see you all to death.
She's beautiful, too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I suggest another strategy?
They died.
Apples are big.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about it.
She sings?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I'm a doctor.
Tom listened with interest.
I think they're happy.
Do you understand Tom?
Let's get to the car.
You're interfering with me.
She wondered what his lips would taste like.
A good coach trains this team.
The tree is sick.
The train was detained because of heavy snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
Why do you think I don't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It was supposed to be you.
Mary left a hat in my room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
You live there?
What would you eat?
Don't you recognize her?
I didn't ask if Tom was planning on doing it or not.
I'm falling.
I was unable to come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom's wearing a new shoe.
Last year, she learned to ride a bicycle.
Help us.
Don't thank me.
Since it was winter, he didn't go out.
Going down the street, I saw a friend of mine.
How many houses in your street?
Elephants are made of ivory.
I'm not a child anymore.
"What's life, Mike?" "Tom's name."
Her mother tongue is French.
It's a bad coat.
She stopped smoking.
Tom was married back then.
I bought this book.
Its only positive quality is naivety.
My hobby is the collection of insects.
Tom's kid lived in Boston.
I haven't eaten in six days.
Can I tell them that?
She's been silent all day.
No matter what he might say, don't believe him.
I moved on.
Tom and Mary hope their next child will be a boy.
Mary's always very welcome, and she's got a nice smile.
I won't let her die.
In all cultures, babies fall asleep under the cradle.
It's the best restaurant I know.
You could've learned a lot from them if you'd just listened.
What was I supposed to do in that situation?
I'm sorry I upset you.
The one who has never left his country is full of prejudice.
It's amazing how quiet it gets when the snow falls.
Tom helps his wife.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd come back.
For many people in India cows are sacred animals.
I've included an imagination.
I thought we could do that.
My mom didn't want me to go alone.
I'm sorry, I didn't get it.
You know what you're doing, right?
Machine translation cannot be trusted.
She hit me, not him.
You won't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
There's a lot of fish in this river.
His success was nothing but a miracle.
We're her peers.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had these symptoms?
Prisoner's release.
What did they say happened?
Can you leave the door open?
I'll have to wait with that.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's twice my age.
Tom knows that what they did was a mistake.
In Japan, the climate is mild.
Check again.
Don't judge Tom.
My mom finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let Toto do what he wanted.
He replaced the trauma player.
Tom said he didn't believe it.
Our trip went very smoothly.
It's inevitable that I'm going to go to France one day, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, it was almost noon.
Tom's just pretending to be sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on taxes.
Tom's watching.
The rain has stopped. You can open the windows again.
I've never been like this before.
I don't think Tom's lost.
I was going out when the phone rang.
I don't have to put up with it.
Always walk away from the road will interfere with the matter.
We're being asked to submit in turn.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
She may be pretty, but I don't like her.
I can drop you if you want.
Tom told Mary she was wasting her time.
You still got a problem with that?
I never asked her.
Nothing relaxes like a hot bath.
I don't really have that much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There's an open book on the table.
I'm sorry, I totally forgot about that.
You have nothing to regret.
She's my mistress!
The sound of your voice is like a melodic song of cheese to me.
What's it like to be married?
I thought Tom could help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?
Tom knew why he didn't like Mary.
My fingers were left with prints on the glass.
Chemistry is a great science.
I feel like my French isn't getting much better.
How am I best able to get a passport?
Perhaps you are able to help Tom.
Tom is the best drummer I know.
I didn't know Tom was your boss.
He needs you.
They're ready.
Tom wasn't paying any attention to Mary all day.
Tom's hair is fat.
Tom doesn't want to sell the house, but he doesn't have a choice.
There's more light outside.
I gave my sister a dictionary.
It's my father's car, but soon it'll be mine.
Did you forget his name?
If I had time to do this, I would.
Do you see Tom's boat?
Big Foma?
This medicine will help you.
Stop the noise.
My stomach hurts.
Do you know how busy I was?
Tom pretended to be busy.
I don't need anyone to trust me.
She's a fan of Sex in a Big City.
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Treat him well.
Tom wants my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do this?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For Christ's sake, stop it!
Nothing compares to a glass of beer after a long day of work.
What happened?
Tom left his bag.
Here are some interesting facts.
How long will it take you?
Let's rest here.
Are you wearing new shoes?
You can leave if you want.
Did you find the book you were looking for?
That's what my mom said.
She was wearing makeup when she saw the dog.
He's not above me at all.
Smoking is strictly prohibited.
That peach is beautiful.
Can you see it?
Tom's not happy about that.
You shouldn't have gone to such a dangerous place.
Good job!
You said that a lot.
Here are some letters for you.
It is almost inconceivable that a scientist of that level would have made such a simple mistake.
He doesn't have any evidence.
You don't look well.
He was swimming really well when he was young.
I'm writing, buddy.
He's very good at playing tennis.
She misled the students.
She said she was Canadian.
Don't talk to anyone.
And when were you going to tell me?
I didn't want to tell you that.
I filled up the kitchen upstairs.
Go straight.
I'm too tired to think about it now.
What house do you live in?
I told them it was ridiculous.
What are we living for?
Will it rain this day?
We know about her.
You could have helped us.
I don't often drive a car.
So you don't like the ending of the movie.
Just get inside.
Just ask him to forgive me.
I'm trying to protect them.
Tom did a great job.
I'm sick of you two.
I didn't know it was legal.
I love adventures.
Tom's in the library.
You went to school then?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who that was.
Why didn't you wait for us?
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Why didn't you sing with us?
Are you happy?
I've decided to forgive Tom.
I'm starting to enjoy myself.
Tomorrow's gonna be a big snowfall.
We decided to postpone the meeting the next Sunday.
She thinks she can prove it.
When was the last time you played golf?
Are we poor?
I don't know Tom's name.
We have the same dentist.
Not all Brazilians like carnivals.
I don't think Tom knows what's going on.
To whom did Tom sell his car?
Tom's moaning.
I have to make money to be able to buy a computer.
Don't laugh at foreigners.
I don't know them.
If you could pick genes for your children, would you?
So Mary and I have to rest.
He went to bed.
It could have been worse.
Tom did his part.
Tom doesn't know where Mary's key is.
What book are you looking for?
I sleep a little.
Someday you'll be there.
Tom's good with Mary.
"You owe me money." "No, you don't."
He went and got down on his knees.
You don't have to go in there if you don't want to.
This song always reminds me of my childhood.
Tom did this for you?
I don't think Tom knows I love Mary.
He says he's rich.
Tom earns three times as much as Mary does.
I drank milk.
Tomorrow's the snow.
Isn't life great?
When it comes to cooking, no one will compare to Mary.
You haven't been yourself lately.
Tom lost his leg when the shark was attacked.
I baked it for you.
We'll do it as soon as we can.
Next year, I'll be three times your age.
Can you tell me what happened?
Show me your stamp collection.
It'll take forever.
Tom is much taller than Mary.
No one seems to know him.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.
How did you know who to give it to?
This tissue fits your skin.
I fell in love with you.
It's almost winter.
I think Tom lied to me.
We're all very proud of her.
Tom's parents told him not to do that.
Tom and I were surprised.
I'm fine.
Tom decided to give up his professional guitar game.
I'm married now.
It was just a few times.
This time you've gone too far.
It's working.
Are you going to see Tom before he leaves?
Nothing surprising, Tom replied.
We want to take the apartment out of town.
They spoke French.
It's too expensive.
He's not singing anymore.
I didn't know what else to do.
They still haven't woken up.
Tom's a couple inches higher than Mary's.
I'm glad you suggested that.
It's hard to answer.
You don't believe her?
English is the world language.
Sounds simple.
Can I get a copy of these?
I just told him to leave Mary alone.
Didn't you know Tom lived in Boston when he was a kid?
Tell them what I told you.
Tom's looking for a job.
Why would you need a hammer?
Stay with me, Dad, I'm afraid of the dark.
The situation is getting worse.
I choose where to eat.
Tom decided to buy a used car instead of a new one.
I just wanted to wish you luck.
She's gonna split up.
I'm not gonna let you take my kids.
Don't give it to him.
Run or you'll be arrested.
Mary said she was very tired.
Tom set himself up to meditate every morning.
Did you check your accounts?
He tried to write a short story.
A room without books, like a body without a soul.
Why has God offended us so much, what sin do we have?
What does your brother do?
We need a volunteer.
Why are you so sure that won't happen again?
I haven't seen you in a hundred years.
I visited Tony yesterday.
It's easy to impress her.
You're old enough to do it yourself.
Aristotle believed that the earth was the center of the universe.
I wonder what Tom actually meant.
No one understands me.
There are so many stars in the sky, I can't read them.
Everyone turned around and looked at us.
Let me see.
White bears live in the Arctic.
I told you I was the best.
I told you Tom wanted to go to Boston.
Tom doesn't have to ask you to do anything a few times.
Let's have the dishes washed tonight who's going to lose in the paper-knife rock!
I'm so unlucky!
I would never do that.
Have you ever been to Boston?
At least he told me so.
Tom's a third-year student.
Will you stay long?
I'm not a woman.
Her father's tall.
The train was overcrowded.
The house is red.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
You know Boston well, don't you?
The orchestra began playing.
Mary was wearing a pirate suit.
That's not my wife.
Why didn't you mention it earlier?
Tom didn't want to be a rat.
He was born seven o'clock in the morning on 5 June 1970.
I'm afraid your plan won't work.
Jane and Kate are twins.
Tom only eats white meat.
Thank you for helping me.
We only have three rules.
She bought one herself.
Security didn't see Tom.
In recent years Tom has become quite mute.
I helped carry those bags.
They've got plenty of time.
Fifteen times five is seventy-five.
I live in this hotel.
I don't want to know anything anymore.
You don't know what he'll say yet.
My hands are tired.
I lied to my wife all the time.
Finally, she succeeded.
It's an abominable outrage that they weren't insured from the fire.
We have a lot of money.
The exam was broken into two parts.
When are you gonna tell them?
Tom didn't want to talk about his illness.
Ah, it's so boring here!
Reading books is comparable to traveling.
Tom saw Mary walk into the store.
Why aren't you there?
Tom said Mary would probably win.
A Japanese would never do that.
I miss Boston so much.
She writes letters all the time.
I don't know who I should consult.
Turn left at the corner.
Tom taught me to do it.
You can do so much more.
Give me one, please.
I don't bear disobedient children.
Tom bought it for me.
What you said made everyone angry.
You're too small for that.
My parents have been married for thirty years.
She demonstrated her talents.
I wish that was possible.
I guess you can't do that.
I'm lucky to be alive.
At the next school festival, Bob will play a major role for the first time.
You need to stay fit.
I've been slinging seeds all day.
By the accent, I realized he was an American.
Maybe it's a problem.
Was that a joke?
Mercy!
Tom obeyed.
All the people of my generation think of it the same way.
I live for it.
Can you ride skis?
The Duke rules many lands.
At least they had fun.
He told me he was very happy.
My dad's getting better.
You'll feel at home.
It won't end well!
He looked like he wasn't eating for a few days.
I didn't ask you to go there.
"Who's Norman Finkelstein?" "American political scientist."
Get out of here!
If it's not selling the goods at home, then maybe it's a new way to meet the girls?
Tom picked up a coin.
Why didn't you go to your room?
If God isn't here, it's allowed.
Both of us are called Mary.
I knew I had to marry him.
Are you still at work?
New?
Don't take anything for granted.
You're on time.
They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please seat belts during take-off and landing.
It was Tom and Mary.
We both like seafood.
I've waited a long time for this.
I rejected the offer.
Do you want to come with us?
Tom didn't eat.
I'm going to have too much time to explain why this isn't going to work.
Nothing's changed.
Did you build all this yourself?
I'm looking forward to summer leave.
Can I put it another way?
He looks great from here.
Woody houses are easily flammable.
Let's throw Tom a party.
The dog's still alive.
I go to university.
I know you lied.
The bleeding's very convenient.
I'll make a report on it tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's a cockroach.
I want to hear your side.
I'll wait for him to arrive.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know the size of Mary's shoes.
I need to think about it.
The meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.
My name is Jose.
You forgot to mention that.
We don't need that anymore.
Can I eat something?
Tom can do it without our help.
Everybody's ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who arranged the meeting?
I'm such an unlucky guy.
Tom's trying to fix it.
I'm not going to have fun tonight, I have to get ready for class.
Mary was the only girl in her skirt.
What bird can't fly?
This must be stopped.
Tom didn't answer right away.
Tom died at the age of seventy.
Life is a gift.
Tom speaks French as well.
The invention of a transistor marked a new era.
I'm not in love with Mary.
Did you hear what she said about Alexei?
You look like a girl.
Here are some pictures.
What's going on on channel ten?
I hate spinach.
Mother's cooking dinner.
Tom's a pilgrim.
What can I do?
Her son is a genius.
I know you've seen terrible things.
I know a few Canadians.
He's willing to let his emotions go.
We were shocked to report his death.
Why didn't they go?
I haven't seen you.
You're just saying it's obvious.
He had cancer.
You're guilty of what happened.
It's like clockwork.
I know where you're going.
You're taking everything for the summer.
Let's get him up.
Let's leave it till tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he tells us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do that.
I don't like doing this.
The cleaning lady interrupted the conversation.
There's a cat in the writing desk.
I don't want to be late for work.
You don't snore anymore.
Tom was a grumpy smoker.
Tom wore gloves.
It's hard to talk to Tom.
I was born in Finland.
Tom didn't want to help me.
Tom said he was worried.
Tom's not used to the weather.
I wonder who's gonna help him decorate the snowman?
I still don't know why Tom did it.
Do you believe in kinship?
What's that noise?
My son has inherited a disease.
That's disgusting.
Is that snow?
I'll call you back.
He dropped the glass.
I don't know if there's a bright side where you can marry your dog.
The best defense is assault.
She's getting married this fall.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it would be easier.
Can we help you?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
The Japanese live on rice and fish.
When are you ready to go?
The investigation began last year with the confiscation of computer records of a person from the German town of Magdeburg.
How's life?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
What made you think you couldn't?
We went back to Boston.
Who's gonna believe this?
Thank you for the correction.
Are you crazy?
The stars appear at night.
Where did Tom get that scarf?
They wanted proof.
Tom's running his pencils.
Tom can't ride a bike.
I'm not talking about the calf at all.
Why did Tom leave?
Why did you want to be a teacher?
I'm afraid of wild beasts.
How much money do you need?
Mary laughed to tears.
I spent $500 a day.
Tell them to go home.
Wherever you want to put it.
They didn't make it in time.
Seven thirty now.
I see you're awake.
I want to know who said it to Tomo.
Tom got up early to see the dawn.
Dinosaurs died a long time ago.
I usually go up one step at a time.
Tom had one more year.
I'm around the station.
Tom is a very good boy.
Are you drinking?
You're from Boston, aren't you?
Put it on my desk.
Tom, get out of the water.
I was very proud of it.
You were ready.
Do you know Tom's brother?
All the lizards can lay eggs.
You'll pay for what you did.
I'm having a hard time today.
I asked them to stay away from this.
Tom only learned to drive at thirty.
I'm glad he didn't get hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed in a long time.
The kitchen knife was not sharp enough to cut the meat, so I used my saw blade.
Honey, I can explain everything.
You're about to adjust to village life.
Keep a bucket of water close.
You're not a child anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're not predictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We're all cool.
There's a river deeper than anything else.
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I've told you this a hundred times.
I'm very cold.
You should probably tell me why.
They died.
Tom and Mary kissed.
The writing of words separately when they have to be written together is a major problem in Norwegian.
What are you doing with the remains of the prepared rice?
Ten years have passed since she died.
Tom met Mary a year ago.
Do you need anything else?
We left soon after that.
This book should be read.
Tom and Mary had classes before dinner.
I don't want to drink your tea.
You're always so romantic.
A woman is not a sapog — you can't get off your feet.
I'll pick you up at 6:00.
I teach Tom French.
I like to learn other languages.
Mary has brown eyes.
I would like to know how long Tom is planning to stay in Australia.
You didn't know I couldn't do that, did you?
How did you feel?
Let's give Tom a chance.
I like fruit.
Tom lied.
He's a car dealer.
Are you still in touch with her?
"Do you think he's coming?" "I hope not."
Tom didn't expect Mary to win.
I hate hospital food.
I've eaten the sparkle.
They shot me.
She knows her husband's psychology.
We have to check.
Tom gave the gun to Mary.
He couldn't believe it with his eyes.
They were the first to take the bus.
Let's wait until Monday.
Does anyone here know them?
There must be a mistake.
He can't afford to take a vacation.
I'm used to smell.
Tom didn't want anyone to know.
How was your day?
It's your fault.
I told you when to come.
Of course I kept my promise.
Our friendship has remained strong.
Have you ever talked to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get closer to it.
Tom was sitting on his feet.
What else does Tom want?
Sometimes lightning hits twice in one place.
I'm not bragging.
Leave it for later.
Tom advised Mary not to leave the door open.
Tom blames Mary for John's death.
Decide for yourself.
Were you surprised?
We counted the annual rings on the tree that we had broken and determined that he was thirty years old.
I think I've known you my whole life.
I want Tom never to write my daughter again.
Rabbits breed fast.
I don't want to discuss this right now.
What's the coat cleaning going on?
We'll paint it.
It's a narrow opening.
I'm not afraid to go to a cave.
When happiness knocks on your door.
You need to listen to her.
