It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old father.
How do they treat you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That'll take time.
Why don't you go get him?
That's one of mine.
You look like you're cold.
I'm walking.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I turn to you?
Do you like the bike?
He's a bread lover.
I feel like a fool.
Tom didn't give me enough help.
I'm not gonna use it, Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean to him?
Tom told Mary he was happy.
We only met once.
Thanks for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's quit.
How much is it worth?
The water was up our ass.
Tom pretended to notice that Mary was watching him.
What do you usually do on Monday?
Tom stopped walking backwards and forwards.
Tom picked up the flag.
Do you believe me, Tom?
Tom's not my dad.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
He's probably still got it.
She looked beautiful.
We were in a hurry.
What is this?
Nobody knows that.
The drain was blocked.
Breakfast is from seven to nine o'clock.
Tom came back last week.
Everyone was scared.
I've seen it before.
You chose well.
Nudists think the goal is normal.
We sat and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
I was kidnapped.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good woman.
Dan shared his racist attitudes in public.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
Give it back to me.
The wolves stalked the herd.
That song haunted me for years.
I'm working.
We'll be there.
Did Tom pay the rent?
This gentleman is my acquaintance.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
The racists are fools.
Are you happy, Tom?
Have you fired a gun before?
I love that tattoo.
For nothing, he's got a card.
I don't want to turn myself in to the police.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you back?
I feel lonely in this town.
What have they ever done?
Tom's a childless man.
I don't live in Boston.
They sued the government for the damage.
Nobody trusts Tom.
The watch had a guarantee.
What about meeting tomorrow?
I should have known you'd be here.
When did the loot happen?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone ring.
Tom did as Mary had told him.
Show us where you found him.
I thought I'd never find him.
Competition for that job is great.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom knows he wasn't a good father, so he's trying to buy himself out.
Tom can't pretend.
Tom said he wanted me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have a confession to make.
Alcohol affected him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looked around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom's a little flushed in his cheeks.
Nobody cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would have answered correctly.
I have to help him.
He's criticizing himself.
You'll understand when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom spit the gum out.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure that Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go on a picnic with John.
Don't be daring with me.
I think you did it.
Don't be ridiculous, we didn't come from the monkeys, we have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
When do you usually have lunch?
I consulted him.
Have you ever thought about quitting?
It's been going on all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rough.
Sounds like Tom.
No one's judging you.
Stop blaspheming Tom.
What could go wrong?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom was having breakfast later.
Are you helping me?
Are you two cousins?
He likes ham with eggs.
Just put it on my tab.
I'd rather ride a subway than a train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom's obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Has he done his best?
Mary rewinded the movie.
She has beautiful handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
Tom wrote this report himself.
Do they buy these?
She doesn't look so good.
Hey, can you give that back to me?
That was personal.
I'd better go, too.
Excuse me briefly.
Take off the hat.
It's very good to play.
Please don't mumbling.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London.
I'm not gonna be lonely here.
He asked me to look at him.
We'd better not go out in a storm like this.
Took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Should we really eat pizza this early in the morning?
Can you go back?
Tom and Mary spoke French.
He shaved.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary were married before.
Do you want to sing?
You're lucky.
My nose is running every time I'm cold.
We've met several times.
Nobody liked the soup.
The tree is green.
The surface of the moon is wrong.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way that you'll understand.
Everybody's looking for happiness.
Did anyone else come into the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something in it.
Tom was terrible to me in high school.
Tom was wearing a hat that still held the price.
Tom promised to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
You have to make a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We need to call for help.
That's what the paper said.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would lend you money if you asked for it.
Tom is obedient and even submissive.
Where did Tom open it?
Mike said he'd come.
I'm just having some fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're man-eaters.
Don't make a man with a mold.
She tried it herself.
Run!
Is it paid for delivery?
I like to rap.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass is easily broken.
Tom's bed is empty.
He's got a weak heart.
Did you buy me those?
You've never seen one like that, have you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be fine.
The mosquitoes carry malaria.
You've been delaying this for too long.
I don't understand.
That's sad.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you do, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We also receive checks.
A newspaper costs a dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were eyewitnesses.
You hit one.
The Macedonian has four verb ways: plain, conditioned, commanded, and spoken.
They haven't left yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The peaceful surface reflected her drawings as a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you for a second, Tom?
These pants are right for me.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We're the champions.
You scared Tom.
That's totally true.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw garbage on the ground.
I remember meeting the queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay cash.
Tom's a martyr now.
Tom looked angry.
What will the Japanese economy be next year?
That's how I got in trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How can you not sleep?
They're giving me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a seal.
I need to think about myself.
I was trying to find him.
We got a big door.
It's a children's game.
Tom's not mad at you.
I'll be back at six and a half.
Tom fucked me up.
I wasn't there for an hour.
I'd love to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show has to go on.
Make a good standing scandal.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did you have to?
Don't attract attention.
I almost fainted.
Pick your favorite stick.
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
We're out of gas.
Tom's a midget.
Who do you have on the list?
He's got an alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Is this where we wait for him?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you brought Mary flowers?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't want ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
May I go with you?
Tom looks pretty sleepy.
Tom spends a lot of money.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom complained about was food.
Make sure you don't get laid in the mud bar.
They both coughed.
The train passed through a tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
We weren't waiting for them.
Are the meals included in the price?
That would follow.
Do you like tennis?
It's gonna be okay.
Sauna's here.
It can't be her.
Today is the day they try to escape.
Everybody's gone crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom's known Mary since kindergarten.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still confirmed.
I'm here to look for her.
It's all wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good show.
Tom the police already questioned him.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom left.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
I guess you're right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom's got the pink room.
No survivors.
She was supposed to shut up.
I'm not like you!
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
They smiled quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I put a slap on him.
Tom's not alone.
Tom needs to take a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll do it.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were over a hundred people at the party.
This will cheer you up.
The king was especially troubled to speak because of his heavy speech flaw.
She didn't accept the invitation.
Tom seemed surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
This bag is too heavy.
The weather forecast is flawed.
Don't look so upset.
In vain, the rebels tried to sink the submarine.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to end up in jail than then run away.
I licked myself.
When do you study?
Tom had a hard time swallowing his pills.
It is worth quoting a famous passage of his essay.
Tom's making Mary happy.
Tom's reckless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by human eaters.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem busy.
We'll get right on it.
Didn't you hear me scream?
I'm going for a walk.
Don't overeat.
Just ask them to give it back to you.
Pull out the thruster.
I don't have plans for tomorrow.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
So didn't you want the reward?
Watch the demon.
I'm glad you're glad.
They're uncanny.
Why can't you go now?
You will learn to value your health when you get sick.
Look at the bright star.
I don't know how to help him.
Buckle up.
Make him admit it!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short skirts.
Can You Explain Why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory is lame.
We've been bankrupt.
Everybody knows you hit Tom.
Can't you just help me out a little bit?
I like this school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When do you have to renew your passport?
Mary doesn't have the guts to face Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
It's from Tom.
There's not even a drop of height in his story.
The battle was short.
I'm so retarded!
We discussed this.
Tom's got the ball.
Where's the nearest bench?
Let them call me.
The electric heater heats the ceramic tiles from the floor of the bathroom.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll pay me back when you have the money.
Dan came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I've had enough of this war.
In the woods, monkeys came down from the crumbs.
Let's forget it for now.
Because of the sudden death of his father, he gave up his plans to live abroad.
You're quick to receive data.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hello, ladies.
I'm gonna resuscitate the whole thing.
I don't know.
I didn't stand it at first.
He's got his sleeve attached.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'll stay here and help him.
Quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he's not cold.
We're trying to help him.
They all left except for him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you played chess.
It's dark.
The pipes are jammed.
I insulted you, didn't I?
Tom can't drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
They knocked beside him.
Tom's not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked.
Tom made a mistake telling everyone I died.
I think we found one.
The deadline for reports is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was pretty.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I thoroughly examined the situation.
Tom's just a regular guy.
The dog's name is Ken.
I am the one who will help her, not you.
Most whales feed on planktons.
We have to get out of here right now.
I'm ready to do it.
My water came to my knees.
Let's make a cake.
I need you to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
Unfortunately, you'll have to release Tom.
Shame!
Don't get so excited.
Sylvia loved the concerts very much.
Invite them to join us.
Where do you want me to park?
Does anyone care?
How did you do that?
Tom drank from a bottle of wine.
I fell off a bike.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in this book?
Do you mind?
When does this show start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks broke.
Tom told Mary to donate money.
I've got him with me.
Didn't your name be Cookie the old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But you lied to her.
I'm not married yet.
Is it deep?
Tom's my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom started laughing.
This is Tom's school.
I don't feel very good today!
Tom didn't approve the plan.
After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with that.
Did you ask for money?
Get him!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multifaceted process.
I have a little present for him.
This is my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
Tom's not shy at all.
Tom's running down the valley.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
The mustard's really hot.
We advertise our products on TV.
I was kind.
Tom was a good man.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
I had a few auditions, but I didn't get a job.
That happened almost 30 years ago.
Tom's too old to live alone.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to do that before.
You've been a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I need to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a match?
Tom's my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
You hit me on the head.
Is anyone in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say no?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom would panic.
Tom was 30.
She's almost gone.
You should try this.
I expect a call from them.
He's been blocked.
Tom's struggling.
Tom developed the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, you didn't get what you hoped for.
I just fired them.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom really needs help.
You have to stay as far away from him as possible.
Tom would understand.
We were laughing at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
Tom got me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that satisfactory?
Tom held out his hands.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says the previous dentist told him that if he stopped smoking, he would remove his stains from nicotine.
Don't expect everyone to share your opinions.
That's what Tom suggested.
It kind of seems wrong to me.
Tom's a smart guy.
Carrito dust is a mixture of more spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything they said.
This has been a hard night for me.
Tom was driving around town with a pick-up brake without notice.
Yeah, anyway.
Do you want a camping trip?
Who broke the cup?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't mean to shut Mary out of the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom looks suspicious.
Keep that to yourself.
You do now, don't you?
I'm pretty stoned.
I'm not an employee.
My old English teacher must be turning into a grave right now.
People often complain about how others treat them unjustly, not realizing that their own behavior is undesirable.
He's wearing high heels to make it taller.
Do you like bowling?
I'm sorry, I think you dropped something.
All you have to do is talk to Tom.
I'm right.
I've been robbed three times this month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I want to practice.
Tom owns a blue car.
Don't worry.
I'm here with Tom.
Tom was totally humiliated.
Don't call me an asshole.
What does it matter?
We're finally meeting, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house is not big enough for our family.
You gave up the idea.
I must sound funny.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
How much money you're in.
Did someone hit Tom?
We have one rule here.
Tom's made up his mind.
Tom won't be very effective.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to climb.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used impeccable expressions.
Coffee's powering you!
Tom was a nice guy.
It's a big metric for football.
Why did you ask me that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the dark.
We're gonna miss you, Tom.
Tom works for NASA.
Tom's spelling.
Something very similar happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom writes his homework.
Dan no longer felt safe in his own home.
Tom already told me.
They have to talk about it.
Tom's really upset.
Why did you leave so suddenly?
We all experience her behavior as repulsive.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose composition is this?
Stay away from her.
His eyes glowed with anger.
Why were you yelling?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to set up our tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom ran away to help Mary.
It's possible Tom has cancer.
If we work as a team, we can achieve anything.
That's what you're gonna have to ask him.
You gave your word.
If you're ready to go, we're ready.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
"I want to travel." "Me too."
There's a lot of birds in this forest.
Please let me stay.
Come on, walk.
He just wanted to meet me, Tom.
You need to ask them for help.
I'll never tell you.
It's possible that Tom was richer than we thought.
I never meant to deceive you.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't want that.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear, and ran to the window.
I know your soy.
He apologized.
I can't find the address of the hotel.
Smoking means suicide.
Hardwings, butterflies, and cockroaches are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's light a fire.
I wanted to bring this to you as soon as possible.
What's your hat?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom took his knee off.
Where did the pinnacles come from?
Can we talk upstairs?
It's made of leather.
I have to rest.
Can I take a look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took his coat off.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom showed up, and the crowd was clapping.
I think that's Tom.
Tom worked very hard, but it didn't work.
Dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink sodas.
I want to find Tom.
He's also a writer.
I almost had a heart attack.
I recognize the guy.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Get her inside.
You're cooking turkey with bulbs.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going to what he wants to be.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you vegetarian?
Dan had five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I gave up smoking.
I know how it sounds.
Tom didn't seem to mind sitting alone.
I'm already feeling much better.
I gave them one more chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
Too bad concrete doesn't burn.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stopped at once.
My dad used to take me here when I was young.
You're such a nerd.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I should have kept my mouth shut.
I'm stoned.
Tom got here early.
He dried his wet clothes by the fire.
He's always staring at his English knowledge.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have blankets?
None of the pigs have failed.
She bought a loaf of bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are clumsy.
What happens next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital!
You should give them some space.
Cars have four wheels.
Tom's passionate.
What happened was a rare occurrence.
Tom packs his bags.
What good is that?
That's very helpful.
Tom was vibrating his phone.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not coming back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I was doing last night.
The girl walked slowly.
Turns out you're unexpected eloquent.
Prejudice saves you a lot of time.
That didn't go so well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom wasn't having lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Since the note was written in French, I could not read it.
They made him do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
The room's full.
I fired her.
Don't be daft.
I can't open a jar.
This was Tom's idea.
I've decided to let you get back to work.
Tom couldn't stand it.
Tom's still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear you.
Tom smiled at Mary.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom thought about it.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your necklace.
That doesn't have a big priority.
Take this.
How much is it now?
You know what I mean?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always got everything he wanted.
You won't make it.
Tom cleaned up his room.
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
I was ready for the war.
Tom slipped on the ice.
I'll never capitulate.
I hope you're ready for a challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
That's the first cockroach I see this spring.
Do you want to dance?
Why did you fire us?
I was home last night.
The girl who works in the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom's having fun.
Tom's not very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Take care of yourself!
Linda was very tired, and she suspects she's pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 from the front gate.
The meeting began more than an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I'll do as I know, and I can.
I have money.
You can study here.
Tom wasn't told why Mary wasn't there.
Tom, fix it.
Tom threw the arrow.
Don't get cocky.
I'm not safe here.
At my great regret, Mary came to the party in a prodigal dress.
I'll say whatever you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't mention anything about anything.
The worst kind of hangover is the emotional hangover.
Let's get fucked up.
Beekeepers remove the sachet to collect the honey.
I have to help them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I'm not going to forget Nicodemus.
Tom won the fight.
I want you to bring them here right away.
Tom lives abroad.
They work here?
Tom's eyes were shining when Mary stepped into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you even help us?
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting by the river.
My cat's hungry.
We need some tools.
Be ruthless.
That doesn't seem very possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There are many big cities in Brazil.
I still haven't solved that riddle.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he is.
Tom was moving his toes.
You know me better than it seems.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got big problems.
It's not blue, it's purple.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
The lambs usually kill them before they turn one year old, so they eat people.
Can you get this gun out of my leg?
I'd forgotten how smart you can be.
Can I see that one?
He spends his money in the sky, it's water.
We're not holding anything back.
I guess I just didn't think so.
I'm not really sure.
Let's end this.
I've told you a million times that you shouldn't exaggerate.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come on.
This book weighs.
Why do we need to find her?
I'm just saying be careful.
Tom's been lying to me all the time.
The hotel rooms obviously sound very bad, and I hear him in the next room chewing gum!
Did you get scared?
Please feed the cat.
We'll be fine.
Let's take a walk through the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, obviously you have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the key.
Look at us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Are you kidding me?
Please, talk to me.
Angels guard us and lead us.
Why isn't Tom helping us?
Therapy didn't help.
My grammar is weak.
Tom was at his disposal.
Tom's going into town.
I'm interested in Japanese culture.
This is a call.
Who saw me?
Tom's getting closer.
Tom's the real hero.
Where did you come from?
Tom wanted to be able to tell Mary all about it.
I'm reading it now.
Tom had no choice but to leave.
That's what's done.
These goats are hot.
Tom went fishing.
Tom didn't think for a second to try and convince Mary to do it.
Let's go to the mall.
Let's celebrate.
I haven't played Monopoly since college.
Tom closed his closet.
Maybe we're related.
I'm sorry I didn't call you.
Can I use this pen?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why do you ask?
It's not the other way around.
Tom's sleeping tight.
Be smart and don't tell your parents about it!
He was standing in front of her.
There are multiple exits.
Tom has always been very protective of the children.
I asked the same question.
We had to find a place to stay while we were renovating our house.
He gave me six lazy twigs.
I'm safe.
Your eyebrows look strange.
That's why I can't help you.
I have not yet found the time to write that report.
I can do it without it.
There are others who want to hurt Tom.
I believe in miracles.
She's dressed up.
Tom threatened Mary.
Tom couldn't have been prevented.
I really want to walk by the river in the morning.
You have to let me go home.
Will you take it?
Talk to him.
Go get Tom a blanket.
The ingredients for this recipe are a little expensive.
Save your strength.
How could this happen?
I asked them to unlock the door.
Get off.
We need to find him.
He used me.
What a shame.
Tom nodded.
I don't find the formula.
You're in power.
I'm thirty years old.
Wow, look at this.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
Do you know how to rot?
I have very little money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'll use the dream.
What about a sandwich?
I know what to learn.
Surrender the units.
It was a terrible sight.
Dan's knife was spilled with blood.
Who were you talking to, Tom?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everyone here loves you very much, Tom.
This afternoon, we're gonna eat cherry from Italy.
And Tom's from Boston.
It's a cruel bull.
I'll take Tom home.
I've been gone for three weeks.
I'm stronger than you.
Who's on shift today?
Tom and Mary moved to Boston.
He's dead drunk.
I need some sunscreen.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was unkind.
It works for me tonight.
They were traveling east.
Tom's pretty strong.
I can't stand this guy.
You're the owner.
Water is the source of life.
The pyramids that fell off the roof were torn apart.
Who owns this property?
Mary and Kate are inseparable.
I helped clean the tub.
Come by anytime.
Tom would have thrown us out.
Tom's not ashamed.
I'm just finishing up the report.
Come on, hurry up, it's urgent.
You better go.
Tom missed the exit.
I've got two cameras.
What'd you find?
Dan confessed to Linda that she was a heavy drinker.
That's Tom's drawing.
The game is not over.
Tom put his drink down.
They stole my wallet on the bus.
Don't argue with me.
You seem to find it hard to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm not useful to you here.
Is anyone hurt?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
They paid me to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary screaming.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
The amebs are lifeless.
If you do that to me, I'll cut your throat.
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Tom goes swimming every day.
This doesn't have to mean Tom's dead.
Waves make the wind.
Get a clean glass of the closet.
This isn't a joke.
None of that matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father wouldn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a chance they'll kill.
I left a message.
Is that all you've seen?
That would be a disaster.
I like how French write their word for "bubamara".
The jack can raise 20 tons of concrete.
You're beautiful.
I think it's too risky without any help.
Is that what you're good at?
We're pretty good.
The pork is cut into cubes and fried.
Ask an expert.
I love traveling.
Love is the answer to everything.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I've loved you for a long time.
Dan arrived at Linda's apartment.
Tom had a hard time dealing with Mary.
Tom seemed to be trying to convince Mary to do something.
I want to get up and play.
That's kind of nice.
Tom wiped out his forehead.
The book has not yet been translated into French.
Tom's here.
Gangsters blackmailed a lot of money from the rich man.
No one ever comes here.
Actually, it's kind of boring.
You're having a bit of a conscience, aren't you?
I was looking for blood.
I need a minute.
The capital of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.
Tom will explain it to you.
I should have asked you first.
Do you know where Tom got that scar on his chin?
Tom had a bruise on his arm.
Here, take the bracelet, your nose's leaking.
Tom was going with Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
They were originally farmers.
You just have to trust me.
I just don't want you to do anything you're gonna regret.
I'm upset.
Tom rarely comes out.
We set up a tent.
I didn't think it was gonna rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
I wish Camoli stayed.
She's got ten kids.
Tom told me not to.
You look very handsome, Tom.
I'll take care of Tom.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
Tom and Mary didn't talk to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did that happen?
Now I'm pretty healthy again.
Tom was still dressed in pajamas and a bathroom when I came in this morning.
We've all read that.
Go this way.
You're tired.
The vocabulary is not exactly grammatical.
I can't convince Tom.
I can go.
They invited me to their wedding.
Is there any other questions you'd like to ask me?
Tom was Mary’s first teacher.
There's a fountain in the middle of town.
You have to help her.
The reader will soon realize that my analysis is accurate and that its results are reduced.
I've tried.
A broken tree blocked the road.
Don't interrupt, Tom.
There were no more blankets.
Tom's got a fast car.
All my attempts have failed.
Math is the best thing for him.
They were so happy together.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
He put his head on my shoulder.
Tom wouldn't like that.
Did you see the rainbow this morning?
Tom believes in strange things.
Tom wants to dance.
Tom told Mary he saw John with Ellis.
You hurt me and you called me an asshole.
It's empty.
Did you find him?
We were passengers.
I think Tom's pretentious.
Some fish can change their gender.
I can take it from her.
Get some food.
Maybe it'll be hard.
I don't curse their children.
You have to help him.
I thought maybe you could help.
I think they lied to you.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom's downstairs.
I don't understand why you want to do that.
It makes us work too hard.
Slow down.
He wants every wedding to be the groom and every funeral the deceased.
Tom's probably okay.
I believe in ghosts.
My dad's home.
Do you want to ride with us?
Why don't you wait a few days?
Tom wasn't surprised to see Mary with John.
Have a good night.
I told you the truth.
They're offering free condoms.
Wet climate conditions are not relevant to the peninsula.
Tom knew Mary would help him.
Tom is never there.
Please do your best.
I'm sure I can find him.
Tom pulled out a pen.
Why should I care what you do?
Do you know any French songs?
My aunt asked me to buy her a music box from Italy.
You can't beat me.
Shall we arrest Tom?
How long should this medicine be taken?
I don't need a bed.
Put us on Facebook!
Did you buy us anything?
The answer was yes.
Lovers who are truly happy do not record their happiness.
I still don't know what to do.
Just get out of my way.
Please show me more.
I need to get my house painted.
We won't create it.
The man you met at the station was my father.
I teach him English.
Usually what causes the pain?
We're dependent on work.
This box is made of potassium.
She passed the test for a reason.
Trust your gut.
He can't do that.
You didn't listen.
Tom's angry.
Try not to pay attention to Tom.
Mix all the ingredients in the bowl.
Sperm was poured; there was lots of sperm.
Tom's very boring.
I vaccineed myself against the flu.
Just try it.
I like to play, too.
Tom was a piano teacher.
Tom was one-legged.
Is Tom interested?
Here it is.
I want to have a little chat with you about Tom.
Tom's not famous.
I'm sure Tom will know how best.
We could talk about her.
I'll find you later.
What do you think of Boston?
I've never surfed.
I'll find something.
We ate turtle soup.
We can work in the open if it's light.
I'm the only one here who knows where you've hidden Tom's jewels.
That cake is calorie.
I didn't vote for you.
I'm afraid of death.
Tom seemed a little disoriented.
It was effective.
Tom's alive.
I blame Tom.
We'll be able to sit you down soon.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
They told me you knew how to do this.
You're experienced.
What's wrong with her?
It's not usually a pen.
The water was hot.
Where's the phone?
They'll pay us well.
Tom seemed upset.
Tom says Mary should be happy.
I've been hit by a car.
I'm not more fashionable.
Maybe I'll die tomorrow.
You're my friend.
What's the story?
So these are the strangest prisoners I've ever seen.
I spend most of my day here.
Is this where we wait for her?
If you go out like this, you'll catch a cold.
Does it still hurt?
That was pretty funny.
I set it up.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did Tom say anything?
Are they all busy?
They don't want the people to be independent.
I'm dying of thirst.
What kind of food do you want to cook?
I'll do it myself.
Allah knows.
Let's ask this.
Tom was wounded.
Where were you last year?
Let's find out more about Tom.
I should go home.
Tom didn't resist.
We were making a quiz today.
I'm dead serious.
Pass me the wine.
All stores are closed.
You've been making white again!
Stop sucking your dick.
Tom's done with the dishes.
That didn't happen.
Be a man.
Needless drama.
We believe in God.
We need to take what we need to stop Tom.
There's only one way to solve this.
I'd better go alone.
I was the one who dug this hole.
I don't want to know.
Does Tom agree with his associates?
That smells like cheese.
Guess what happened.
I'll give you some advice.
No matter what you do, always do your best.
Dan encouraged Linda to report the rape.
Tom is a responsible adult.
I can't call them at home.
You're a racist.
I already forgave you.
Why don't we just stay?
I didn't hurt Tom.
Maybe I wasn't clear.
Somehow I still don't believe it.
What's a shortcut?
Thanks again for coming.
He's cheating on us.
The wounded soldier was barely walking.
The sun just rose.
I actually know the answer to that question.
Why don't you hug me?
What's stopping Tom from doing it again?
Tom often downloads movies.
I was beautiful.
I like Tom's discreet humor.
The light is turning away from the water.
Tom stabbed the soup.
I don't fuck you.
You can ask Tom.
Tom examined the items on the table.
The police put Dan in jail.
Go back to your seats.
Can I touch you?
Do you miss anything?
Sit a man crying.
Do you intend to help him?
We went to the trees.
Anyway, I'll do it.
I knew you'd take Tom's side.
They couldn't avoid them.
We need to find them tonight.
It's too impressive.
I'm sorry I didn't call them.
Pray to God, not his prophets.
Tom was acting like a date.
We're even with him now.
We walk to school together.
You're so talented.
I have to fix this.
Where are you going?
I have lunch this afternoon.
I hate it when you fight.
I should have been more polite.
Have fun, Tom.
It's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This fits perfectly.
He poured his hose bag.
I'm sorry, but my answer is denied.
I'll get it for you.
Tom wrote two books.
My advice is not to give Tom a gift.
Tom was a hard worker.
Tom lived right next to me when I was a kid.
Tom puts his hand around Mary.
She has short hair.
The crowd laughed.
I'll send her to stay with you.
Tom didn't buy it.
I don't have a Turkish keyboard.
I came here to study.
He went down the valley.
Do you want me to make something up?
I have to put water in the radiator.
I'm going with Tom.
Tom and Mary will probably never see each other again.
Let's take a look.
The European wants to drink wine.
My husband is a good man.
He's got a lot of debt.
She knows the more important capitals.
What's under the blanket?
Nobody wants to play with her.
Tom to all the drinking tours.
Are you ready to go?
Tom's obviously out of his mind.
Tom came to them.
You think you can trick me?
My name is Ivan.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to come with us.
It can't be him.
Tom certainly didn't want to say that.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary was proud of her ligature.
The teacher teaches.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rude.
That's not a good enough reason.
First, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they afraid?
I'm carrying my passport.
It was a masterpiece they often talked about.
What was the question?
Science is not fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she gets back.
I don't have a pen.
When should we start caring?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom wants vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?
They concluded that the ship had submerged.
Did you buy the cure?
Did Tom drink?
I'm in pain of work.
The question is who's gonna do it.
I'm going to Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Are they all happy?
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
Forget about it, okay?
I need to call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy's pissing me off.
It's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.
I wasn't right at all.
Please ask me anything.
Hey, what is it now?
I'm not ashamed.
Tom's under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
How do you look?
Tom's a Wunderkind.
That walk goes to school.
He's starting to get in our head that we can't ignore nature.
I don't understand why you don't want to help.
Tom's got a lot on his mind.
Now the question is, what should we do?
When was the last time you talked to Tom?
He ended up fourth of 56 runners.
Don't worry.
Do you trust Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a kid, he was obsessed with the girl who lives across the street.
I think I can.
Tom forgets.
That sounds really good.
Tom really likes Boston.
Tom annoyed Mary's silence.
They'll be here soon.
Tom found what he was looking for.
I'll be in my chambers.
They didn't act fast.
I'm weak.
Swim the wool sweater.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
Vampires live forever unless someone kills them.
I wouldn't want to mess with Tom.
They'll never take you to that club.
Tom wasn't born blind.
Is he looking for Tom?
Here's the bride!
I know my job.
Tom hasn't called.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
They left me alone.
These animals are in danger.
Tom made a suggestion.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the gate open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned to see her.
Don't you dare ask them that.
That can't be true.
Tom's ready.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He has tremendous potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We heard it carefully so we wouldn't miss a word.
I already have plans for this weekend.
Why are you so upset tonight?
Tom fell backward.
We're exaggerating.
Please let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late for compensation.
Is the house ready?
Tom's jokes are urban, and they're getting even better once he's had a couple of beers.
You have nice eyes.
You don't understand business.
Is this your bag or his bag?
Tom called to say he couldn't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
Yeah, he'll be fine... when the willow gives birth to grapes.
Tom's an advisor.
Can I talk to you for a second?
You insulted me by calling me a donkey.
Since when has there been fireworks?
It's possible Tom's lonely.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom wants the same thing you do.
I didn't give up anything.
I was thinking of you yesterday.
I know where to look for them.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.
I'm losing my hair.
The big question that no one has answered, including me, despite thirty years of research on the female soul, is, "What do women want?"
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
Villagers reap the harvest.
Tom won't like that.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
How deep is the failure?
I can work anywhere I want for a year.
What's on the table?
Tom's not violent.
Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did you ask her to leave?
Keep your promises.
I've been looking everywhere.
What object was it?
We taste death each time we split up.
Tom was a fanatic.
Are you sick of me?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's ready to cry.
She looked around.
They're vegetarians.
Tom was pissed off.
Tom needed advice.
My laser printer knows how to scan pictures.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe it?
Maybe Tom doesn't understand how valuable that picture is.
Everybody's up.
Money is not a test of success.
I want to know when your birthday is.
Guys, what are you talking about?
Hold my luck!
The concert ended with the folk anthem.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not moving.
Wait a second.
I have something to do.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
He was running as fast as he could.
I won.
Every shade is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
No comment.
I think he's hiding something?
I hope there's enough air here.
She married zero of a man.
Wind's tight.
Nothing has changed.
You don't have to dress anything up.
The old man was cut to death.
I don't like this book.
Lucky I did.
What would Tom want that for?
The sun is a star among billions of others.
I've got some pussies.
Can someone help me?
We'll go this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to get over Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you ask Google?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't mind me, Tom.
How old is this TV?
This mystery is solved.
Tom was admitted to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have a lot to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in a park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, here's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's true.
Are you sure we shouldn't order first?
The one who can hear the butterflies laugh knows and tastes the clouds.
We played golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom will bow down.
Just find them.
I can't deal with them.
They drew lots to see who would go first.
I gave him a chance.
You have a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
It's not to wait like goods!
But if I were in Brazil, I'd be more afraid.
Have you ever worked as a bartender before?
Did you forget that again?
I don't like it at all.
I just ran out of time.
Where will this product be used?
I'm not a student.
I have the flu and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food cools, heat it in the microwave.
The stream is on our right.
Tom's not an old man.
This looks too simple.
I want my old life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money he saved.
I think it's time for you to leave now.
This guy's a gangster.
It's possible Tom saw him.
Tom's a little limp.
Tom's very immature.
What are they up to?
How's the cylinder volume?
He was a great musician.
Tom's not drunk, but he had a drink.
They accepted your company.
Tom, you gotta get up.
Tom wants a rematch.
Tom stabbed a fork in the stork.
Will I be replaced?
I need to get us some help.
You can count on us.
Tom found a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too cool for me.
Whales are like mammals.
Dan waved Matt and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I totally get it.
Tom seems shaken.
Are they brothers?
"Did you like his music?" "No, but you?"
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he didn't want to eat at that restaurant.
He's ready to go down.
This will greatly facilitate our work.
I think that's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would he leave here?
He took over the business.
You don't even like fish.
I saw Tom do it.
Her mother speaks Italian.
I'm on vacation here.
He's got wine.
His feelings were not returned.
You're not that young anymore.
I love the rhythm of funeral marches.
We're probably lying.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you're interested, tell me, I'll give you his number.
Tom knew he wouldn't be able to do much about it.
I like this.
Squeeze your sleeves.
I can't believe we actually did this.
How many miles from here to Boston?
That's what I'm good at.
Does it hurt a lot?
I just want to be able to support my family and myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
He was still there.
I have a lot of questions.
Who runs things here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Every nation has its own language.
I would never accept it.
It'll get even cooler.
What are you drinking?
As it came, it went away.
His legs were shot.
Tom picked up his keys.
It all stopped.
Maybe Tom's drunk.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any more accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The importance of music is underestimated.
Can you show me this place on the map?
Tom is unstoppable.
What's your question?
Tom's gone on a pilgrimage.
Look ahead.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Did Tom piss you off?
This is my latest view.
I haven't been feeling well in two days.
It's worm's waste, it's too easy to bend.
We don't think so.
I think Tom's rich.
I must have made it up to you.
Tom doesn't know what the difference is between brains and donkeys.
The police arrested her.
Take these.
We're expecting her.
Rain coming out doesn't come in handy.
I'll tell them to go now.
Tom wasn't supposed to marry Mary.
I got my ass kicked.
A living soul wasn't in town.
I think you know who I am.
Haven't seen you guys in a while.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
Would you like to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was hitting Mary with a rotten egg.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take it.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of what happened here makes any sense.
I set them up.
What are some of the symptoms associated with mushroom poisoning?
What are you doing here anyway?
Don't despair.
I like to watch porn with lesbians.
And who are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure that John writes his homework.
I can handle her.
Can you play that chord on the keyboard?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom was worried about it right away.
I don't have feelings for her.
I guess I was expecting a little better.
I already do.
She writes a letter to her mother.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom was acting like he was surprised.
The boy was impossible to swim the river.
Tom was here earlier than Mary.
The feeling was mutual.
We want to know about them.
They're delicious.
The old house has a certain charm.
This topic is taboo.
We barely saved each other.
Did they hire you?
A treadmill.
Tom could see Mary sending messages.
You're gonna feel better.
Tom was a little stunned.
Let's do this right.
You can cross all year in Hawaii.
Tom was motivated.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
Most think that computers will never know how to think.
I'm such a coward.
Brother, you can't just come to a woman and scratch her -- it counts as sexual harassment.
I decided to tell her I loved him.
Find your supernatural power.
I'm first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You're losing.
We've wrapped the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom's sitting down.
You can't do whatever you want.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I go on?
He was breathing a lot.
I'm a patient man.
It's not happening here.
It is better to be optimistic and fooled than to be pessimistic and to be right.
The water was quiet.
I'm waiting for the light to change.
The boy was silent.
The body of the ship is divided into several watertight parts.
Since you were cooking, I'm gonna wash dishes.
Let's drop the subject.
Tom knows something he's not telling us.
When are you coming home?
They were attacked.
You can't lose your condition.
He's got fake eyelashes.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear the knock?
I won't wait for them.
There's no need to be scared.
"Are you mad at me?" "Oh, come on!"
He's no longer the shy guy he was.
Contash?
Don't make a scene now.
What was told to Tom?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom was never mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
There were boys in groups everywhere, some playing jammies, some tiles, some with a ball, others driving a bike or riding wooden horses.
Doubts destroy friendship.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was snowed.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk in the bottle.
We should both go.
The pain that causes love is sweeter than any pleasure.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice present.
You have to go home.
Let's go this way.
I just had breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We'll find her.
You misjudged her.
Let me check the manual.
Energy comes from the inside.
No one believes them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
You peeled your head off.
We're in.
Put the seat back.
What's his purpose?
What's Tom carrying?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want my job back.
This isn't normal.
Can we talk tomorrow?
Tom's getting angry.
I don't find the equation.
They're listening to a concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how it got there.
I'm not satisfied.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm angry.
It's less humid today than yesterday.
It's hard to make new friends.
It's funny how people in the tropical zones eat spicy food like curry.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Aren't you going to do anything?
Tom had no family.
I can't determine who wants the baby, because it points to both.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to go home.
This is true love.
Can you look at me?
Even though he's rich, he's not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom got a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my glass.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go pick up Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry in the garden.
Jim was never abroad.
I turned off the TV.
It's a fake lead.
Tom was fighting.
I said it might rain.
I need you to open the door for me.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like this happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Someone's singing.
Do you know how to fix the bathroom?
Go away.
I forgot his address.
You're having lunch?
I'll give her another chance.
Tom's been with me all morning.
Her skirt's got a slid on one side.
Let's get something to eat.
I'll be right out.
What's your analysis?
Tom's too busy to help.
I'm doing fine.
She can neither read nor write.
Tom, you hurt your leg.
Go inside.
Tom and I had a deal.
Everybody's waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We all noticed that.
You've got a lot of beautiful lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know Tom's gonna get out of jail sometime.
The most expensive job is the land.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom made a list of the things we need to do.
Tom's a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
Milk is sour.
They brought us food.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why are you resisting?
I'm sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why doesn't anyone want to help him?
Destroy this temple.
I'll take this.
Tom was the first to ask a question.
I'm gonna ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father, he's my father-in-law.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Count how much money we'll need next year.
I lit a match in the dark.
How much is that over there?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Are you up at 6:00?
Tom sat down again.
What country is Boston in?
Tom's very strong.
Tom spends too much time on a computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I was on my lungs, I only had what I was doing in my room, waiting for me to recover.
Don't thank me yet.
My cat is happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom played the piano.
I'm clean.
I had a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You just heard.
Tom's head hurts.
Oh, come on.
There's nobody here.
That's not recommended.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to quit.
You did your best.
He's a greedy man.
First, let's talk about what Tom needs to do.
Mom's buying me a toy.
I'm not gonna take that chance.
This house needs repairs.
I'm thrilled, Tom.
Tom's a snitch.
Tom's not listening.
Right away, they want everything you told them you'd give them.
Tom was writing stories.
There's just something in it.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many ways, women and men are completely different.
I go fishing every week.
What's going on?
Is that necessary?
Tom's stuck.
I'll never love you.
He made it look easy.
You'd better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well is drying up.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
Maybe you should call them.
They don't like some people.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What am I supposed to do with this?
Does your dog bark?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I love German doughnuts.
At the time, we were eighteen.
I make $13 an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I love broccoli, but I hate carphiel.
I feel like I'm seeing him with his girlfriend.
Tom ran away.
Go on with it.
This is repulsive.
Tom's really busy.
Tom said he didn't know what Mary wanted him to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
Is Tom hurt?
They got you drunk.
Tom's starting to feel sad.
I think you should pick her.
They're restraining themselves.
You're magnificent.
Tom got lost in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Blow out your candles and make a wish.
Come on, open it.
Tom took a cruel look at Mary.
Tom was wearing a dexter.
Tom looks determined.
I'm glad you didn't call her.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended he didn't know Linda.
I was swimming in the river.
Are you ready yet?
How long has it been?
Don't burn.
Who caused the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see it, if possible.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
Tom's a joker.
I've had a lot worse.
Tom was trying to stay calm.
I'm using that computer.
Tom used to be skinny.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Are you there yet?
Just one glass of drink.
No one's writing to me.
Tom's heart is broken.
How do they do that?
That's all I'm asking.
There's so much to do.
You're a pessimist.
Tom's my problem.
Tom's mom told him not to speak with his mouth full.
Everyone was in control.
Every customer has his own rights.
I'm calling you as long as I can hear you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they saw me.
I know Tom's address.
What was the last thing you did?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
This statement is wrong: I'm going shopping because the car is broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little.
Who's Dan talking to?
They've been cursing us.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom isn't invited to parties often.
He doesn't look like his daddy at all.
Tom's not really tough.
It was after midnight.
That's scandalous.
What happens if you get wet?
Did you change your shampoo?
Tom was looking around, the sky was expecting something to happen.
They convinced me to quit smoking.
You can take your coat off.
I don't think they followed me.
They have no defense.
He often helps others.
Tom's a big pessimist.
You're entitled to a phone call.
Skiing was actually much more fun than I expected.
Tom was swimming in the pool.
We can't forget them.
Let's go home.
That's all for now.
Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'll tell you a secret that will change your life.
Let's get this guy.
I do my best.
I don't remind them of their debts.
I wouldn't want to lose my temper.
Their friendship quickly grew into love.
Tom seems so lonely.
I'll stop.
I turned on the lamp.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Fill out this form.
I don't picture a party like that, but whatever you want.
Do you think Tom would like to come with us?
Yoga originates in India.
Tom didn't fire Mary.
Tom had his buttered toast.
We have work to do.
I heard him snooping.
Should we call Tom?
Tom sent you here, didn't he?
Sunlight is the main source of vitamin D.
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives over there, on a ridon.
I'll take anything.
It's not gonna be okay.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the kids alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
It'll be Christmas soon.
You should feel flattered.
Unfortunately, this is an incorrect formulation of the question.
Tom seemed to be used to such problems.
You're gonna be okay.
Everything was so easy.
I'm sorry, but I spilled coffee on the fly.
He rarely went there.
Tom's tough.
Let's sing and dance.
After the war, the winners are always right, and the losers are the guilty.
Tom gave Mary a doll.
Translating jokes is quite difficult, if it can be said at all that is possible.
It's been a day.
I'm bringing bad news.
This doesn't help.
Overcome weakness.
How many pushups do you make a day?
I'm just gonna sit here.
Do you happen to have a key?
Let's be realistic.
Tea with lemon, please.
Tom doesn't have a job.
Maybe this will help you.
I hate him just as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about her.
When he came and found me, his whole body was drinking.
Tom's on fire.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is hard.
I'm not going with Tom.
Was he one of them?
He's got a small joint.
I'll make sure we finish the projects in time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
Music is universal.
You squeeze too hard when you shake hands.
What if we don't find them?
Don't come for you, Tom.
You won first place in the game.
I just want you to come back to me.
Dan's smoking marijuana with Linda.
Tom often goes for a walk before dinner.
Yesterday she stayed late.
You're disgusting.
Everybody shut up.
What exactly happened between us?
You look sad.
You gave up the plan.
It's not just a guess.
How do we find them?
Maybe it's acting weird.
No one can be saved from death.
That won't help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom's been in trouble many times before.
Somebody open the door.
Does this belong to you?
We all hated her.
I just want you back here in Boston.
Democracy encourages freedom.
Why would anyone want to hurt Tom?
You're gonna need a ticket to take a bus.
We're very pleased.
Is that how much we need them?
He was desperate for health problems.
Do you know why Tom didn't come to the meeting this afternoon?
Tom's got earache.
Dan was hit on the forehead with a hammer.
Who gave you that idea?
What was Tom doing?
You're in the middle of a nightmare.
It's not the right time right now.
You don't have alcohol anymore.
When are you going?
I'd like to buy a sofa.
I didn't get an answer from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do it.
Tom got famous.
This song is stuck in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car jumped.
It's all over now.
I tried to get him to come.
What's up, Tom?
The mother's advice would be superior to her friend.
We have not yet escaped the danger.
Tom's freaking out.
He waits ten minutes.
She was wearing a vest.
Dan's looking for the police now.
Tom asked for food.
Look, I can explain.
I saw him over there.
Monday is the first day, Tuesday is the second day, and so on.
They're moving fast.
I need to see Tom right away.
Tom's waiting for you in the conference room.
What was that noise?
My ancestors are from Germany.
Tom cut the tape.
I did it.
I want to listen to Tom's stories.
Tom saw worse.
We know each other.
It's easy to cook pasta.
The hunter went deep into the woods and never came back.
You're hurting me.
I'll pay you what I have to.
I haven't been happy since Tom left.
The breakfast is served.
Tom is a kind man.
Stop screaming, I'm getting sick of my head.
You're not gonna command me, man.
Did you ask him to leave?
Tom has three uncles.
What a beautiful sight!
Tom has a plan for everything.
Don't sweat it.
Tom needs to relax.
I'm jealous of Tom.
What else did you expect?
I was hoping you'd be reasonable.
I'm gonna get stronger.
This elephant is adored by young children.
Thank you so much, Tom.
This is hard for her.
Mary put on her lipstick.
She's got a picture.
It's swimming.
Flowers are dying.
Come for a walk with me.
I promise.
This is very annoying.
We need more American slang on Daddy, under urgent conditions!
We're sorry.
Maybe Tom's gonna get scared and give up.
Is this place free?
Pay attention to this problem.
Don't thank me yet.
I want some tea.
I wouldn't want to get in.
Doesn't anybody want to sit with you?
It would really be nice to keep your mouth shut.
Tom said Mary had a bad influence.
Where's your gun?
Tom wants to do it.
It wasn't easy.
I was a passenger.
I'm flying from school.
I often heard him play the tune on the trumpet.
The disgruntled libido is what produces all the art and literature.
This is really hard for them.
Tom's a fool.
I think Tom's gonna be here in time.
Stick to the plan.
If you get hungry, there's food in the fridge.
Tom beat me.
She's complicated.
Check if the gas is off.
Would you participate in this event?
There's hardly any left coffee in the basement.
We can wait.
Tom and I have written a few books together.
Why are you so angry?
And I prefer coffee than tea.
I wasn't in a hurry.
The mosquitoes enjoy human society.
I'm sleeping on my feet.
I intend to use it.
Can you give Tom a message?
He flirts so aggressively that women eventually run away from him.
Tom set the curtain on fire, all by accident.
Did you talk to Tom?
It's hard to understand self-injury if you've never felt the need to practice it.
This is gonna hurt Tom.
I don't want to ruin everybody's night.
Pressure's rising.
Tom immediately answered Mary’s question
It's a miracle you survived.
Tom's been driving that car for three years.
Can Peace Be Used in Foods?
Tom knows the way.
Tom misjudged Mary.
I need an ashtray.
They're both drunk.
Can you call them?
Tom started to dream.
Who would wear that?
This looks like silk.
Tom's salting his salad.
Tom's the leader.
Save Tom.
You haven't solved this problem, have you?
I'll call her tomorrow.
I don't like talking about them.
We're busy now.
I don't want to tell Tom that.
I've already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They have no choice.
No one will find me.
Tom's been very bitter.
In what situations would you use it?
Can't we start over?
Unfortunately, you're gonna have to do this without someone else's help.
We're all in danger.
Tom won't want it.
I'll give Tom what year he needs.
Tom sighed.
Take Tom's gun.
Look back.
Tom hasn't been back for three years.
I'm giving you one last chance.
Are you in some kind of sport?
Tom, meet your new nanny.
He's afraid of getting lung cancer.
I'm so cold.
Tom played the piano for three hours without stopping.
I got quality.
Did anyone find a baby to babysit?
I'm quiet.
He was chasing the thief.
It was a remarkable experience.
Tom's been hanging around.
Does it matter which one of these I pick?
What did you want to talk to me about?
Do you intend to help me?
The current government has a lot of problems.
Tom didn't kill anyone.
I won't say anything.
It'd be good.
It's a quick walk.
Tom's very cheap.
That's what I said.
Tom's got a butler.
Dan took Linda to safety.
They're my cousins.
It's 11 o'clock.
I'm a homosexual.
Tom thought about it.
We shouldn't have let her go.
The man's wrong.
I can't wait to find out what kind of gift Tom made me.
I've seen him in person.
I love all my children equally.
I'm not doing what you're asking me to do.
Tom seems nervous.
What do you know?
Whose picture is this?
There's no substitute.
A hypochondriac invented diseases where he doesn't exist.
My sister makes hair on a hairdresser two or three times a week.
I slept on a bus.
The rainwater evaporates when it's hot.
Ask him to wait until I get there.
Her son is a genius.
I lost my hand lamp.
It looks very well written.
That was the whole point.
Tom must be still at school.
I never say anything, even though I'm nervous.
You're below his level.
I'm tired of injuring myself.
Is that why I'm here?
Why don't you just call them?
Tom may have hired Mary, but I don't know for sure.
I owe Tom this.
Tom is very childish.
I don't want to disappoint her.
When are you going back to Boston?
Where was Tom born?
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
Please, blow the room.
Tom is still trying to get Mary to accept the job.
How much of our bodies are water?
I don't speak French as well as you think.
That's very smart.
Please help me welcome Tom.
You're so smart.
I didn't see anybody on the street.
Don't take longer than five minutes.
If the weather was running out, the radioactivity was decreasing.
Should we believe that?
What's the big deal?
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I don't have to convince him.
Tom's sitting behind Mary in French class.
How can you help her?
Tom was lured into a trap.
I'll turn them around.
It always happens the same way.
Thanks to the chemistry, we have plastic.
What brings you here?
I need new speakers for the computer.
You're gay.
What are you up to?
Why are you being mean to me?
I can't read without glasses.
I don't mind helping.
No one did anything else.
Forgive me for falling like this.
These books are new.
Thank you for inviting us.
Tom wiped out the dishes.
That was rejected.
I'm not asleep anymore.
Tom made a nice statement.
They must be worried.
I've moved it.
That gave me an idea.
The fed from the watch broke.
I asked myself about him.
Tom says Mary likes you.
Come on, everybody, get me.
This is a good parking spot.
I go to Boston all the time.
Tom's not very old.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I want something new.
Children need love.
That's his business.
I wish I had the camera with me.
It'll be worth it.
We should give him some time.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
You should do it somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe anything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You have to barter the child.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be okay.
This is already a problem.
Tom grabbed a gun.
Tom closed the doors.
I think the box's empty.
I'm a little sick.
Who made this box?
You must be strong.
It's delicious.
Let's take a sledge.
You can sleep here.
Talking to him always comforts me.
I hear they pay pretty well.
Tom was a funny guy.
Did you get something to eat?
Boston's a great city.
Look at me.
How many liters of oil does he collect in a barrel?
Eat slowly.
There could be another world.
We don't have anything you want.
It's green.
Tom repented of what he had told Mary.
Go find him.
It's in the basement.
Tom's out of bed.
I get it.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'll scream.
I just heard from them.
Tom's conscious.
Tom brushed his hair.
Everybody sat down.
He gently touched her.
Maybe we should turn around and come back.
I don't like walking.
She looks a little young to get married.
I hate this school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
We're about to begin.
His brother is patient with him.
No one could prove anything.
What kind of hobby do you have?
So, I'm serious.
No talking during the test, people.
It was necessary.
Donate as much as you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do it.
I always thought you were from Boston.
Do you want me to give you a sign?
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You should write Tom a thank-you letter.
They're not coming tomorrow.
Please find him.
Tom's back in Boston.
The light's faded.
Come on!
And if Tom refuses?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom said he wanted to have breakfast in bed.
Dan's walking his little dog.
It had to be done.
I turned the lamp.
Tom wanted Mary to invite John and Alice to dinner.
I'm not sure that's exactly what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed Mary's statement.
That's very close.
We were worried about you.
Experience does not inherit - everyone gains its own.
I want to believe Tom was happy.
This tissue is very thick when it washes.
The truth is a purpose, not a destination.
I blame him.
Have you heard of him?
Tom started talking.
I ran out of class.
Tom's still tied up.
Have you ever read this?
Without bait, it's gonna be hard to fish.
Tom was napping.
I think she's good at dancing.
Unfortunately, the system is corrupt.
I used to hate you.
Public opinion is important.
Alcohol reduces inhibitions.
Tom needs two help.
I'll tell him to go now.
Tom seems confused.
No one wants to touch this.
Tom says he saw something else.
Her pupils were as black and deep as the abyss.
Tom tried to talk, but he couldn't.
Take it with us.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom wanted Mary to help him out a little more with the kids.
Everybody's got drinks.
Tom picked up the box.
He's a strong critic.
I've healed my cold with this cure.
Are you sure you haven't forgotten something?
We played basketball in the gym.
Call them.
I'm letting you catch me.
Turn the radio on, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a really good place.
I have a lot to do.
I came to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swim because it was cold weather.
You don't have to.
I just wanted to clear up the situation.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
I'll get back to you.
It's not going this way to Tom's house.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life far away in the Himalayas.
Tom got high.
Please repeat.
You're so dramatic.
Tom licked himself.
Tom didn't even know Mary was gone.
She went to school.
They say Maria Antoinette was responsible for the French revolution.
My family starts where yours ends.
He's my partner.
That's cool.
Why didn't you buy more than one of these?
We tried.
But it's cool!
We're like brothers.
Let me cook you something.
You've got too much to do.
Is that possible, Tom?
I have to get her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I'm staring at your courage.
He was voted Mayor of Boston.
The police found prints of shoes at the scene of the crime.
I asked the same question.
I'm pretty hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom kept the letter.
Tom would like that.
She ran out of half-naked.
I said we're closed.
The question is who's gonna tell him.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
Tom can't be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Can we come?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that Sarcasm?
Tom's a screwdriver.
I'm gonna have to try and handle this on my own.
They've been monitoring the spaceship.
Tom wrote me more than thirty messages yesterday.
Are you sure this isn't diamond-making?
You let Tom escape.
What Is the Answer?
Did I say I was done?
Tom doesn't like girls wearing high heels.
Dream you know.
I looked at her.
A great crowd has gathered.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
The time of April is irregular.
Get your hands off Tom.
Are you guys crazy?
I'm warm.
Tom was the boss.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
That's how I like it.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between me and Tom.
I'm irreplaceable.
Give him a second chance.
I cut the sandwich.
Can I see you later?
Tom's legs were cold.
Boys and girls read.
Tom has two kids.
In short, it's your fault.

We were laughing.
Tom was a little hungover.
Tom's only here for a visit.
Where do we start?
I know you're a spy.
I wish you a happy trip.
Go back to your seat.
Tom was considerate.
Tom tried to make it look busy so that Mary would not ask him to help her.
I'm very rarely eating meat.
I'm gonna go ask her.
I'm keeping this seat for him.
Tom couldn't help it.
I'll call her later.
Flowers quickly fade after you cut them.
I called them yesterday.
I'm wearing a bag of rice.
I can do that for them.
Tom doesn't write well.
I ate late last night.
I just don't like it.
Plus, I can fly.
We spent our money.
There was hatred among them.
There's nothing to see here.
Does that sound stupid?
I don't want you to be late.
I really want to help him.
He and I are friends.
I may admire others, but I've never liked being anything other than who I am.
Sometimes it's hard to determine whether Tom's happy or not.
This isn't burning me.
I'll read it to you.
Let's go inside and talk.
Did you make a wish?
Children sometimes fear darkness.
Stay away.
I had to stay.
Tom's here the only one who doesn't understand French.

Who bought you this?
Tom's gonna get you.
My bags are packed.
Tom's been complaining.
Cubic hair.
This is the best restaurant in our area.
That's what I liked.
He crossed the street.
As long as there's life, there's hope.
I heard them snooping.
Too bad I didn't drive a bike here.
I have to visit Tom.
What makes you uncomfortable?
Do you still need a babysitter for Monday night?
I don't wear provocative clothes.
This is classified.
That's not so much.
That's what you said an hour ago.
I don't want to die.
Let me be damned!
I'd rather walk alone.
How many herbs did you buy?
Come back as soon as you can.
Mr. Jackson, your son died of overdose.
Nothing can stop us.

What did you get?
I motivated you.
I don't want to get you in the dark.
I didn't see where you put your car keys.
Are you sure you don't want to look at another option?

He just showed up.
I'll do as you say.
It's a long story.
Tom's gonna be great.
Tom was kind to all Mary's friends.
That would be fun.
He's in the middle of a car trade.
Appreciate the thought.
I'm not leaving.
Do you know that?
You've done a bad job.
Tom's cold.
Emily's a teenager.
They think it's too many.
Who was the thief?
He's got charm.
The question is who decides what to do.
Tom won't catch me.
You're absolutely right.
My voice on the tape doesn't sound like my natural voice.
I told you this was going to get ugly.
I didn't know if to get mad or laugh.
I'm mad at you.
We've been waiting.
Tom got up at seven o'clock.
I've always wanted a dog.
You're perfectly safe.
Tom seems to have everything he needs.
The question is, will he come to visit us next month?
The Marionettes run them by wires.
I don't want to talk about time.
I'm not as fast as you are.
The other girls were teasing her about her clothes.
You're gonna be confused.
I won't follow you.
Maybe Tom already did what he was supposed to do.
I'll give them another chance.
He just called me.
Failure has made him feel better.
How are you these days, Tom?
I can't stand to see him.
Some people are afraid of spiders.

If I can understand, then anyone can.
Tourists weren't happy.
Tom took his socks off.
I'll check the list.
Didn't I tell you not to do that?
Tom's stuttering.
The laws are like spiderwebs, hunting flies, but they let the axles and the scarecrows break through.
You're prouder than peacocks.
When did Tom go to Boston?
He left his desk key, as he used to.
She took off her fur jacket downstairs, climbed upstairs, and knocked gently on the door.
Tom looks so happy.
We don't see the same thing on this subject, but I'm not the one who's wrong.
Something happened to Tom.
You want your life, don't you?
Your desserts are tempting, but we're fine.
We've been looking for you.
You're my date.
I'm willing to help.
We're out of Boston.
I'll wait in the gym.
Tom doesn't like tennis.
How long did Tom stay?

Tom seems desperate.
You sound like it made you feel better.
Tom is unforgettable.
Kyoto is an extremely beautiful city.
This handle doesn't spin.
I think you're right.
It's all very strange.
I'm writing my epiphany.
"Why did you break my vase?" "Dear me."
We were so close.
I sweat every day.
Give me your knife.
No one defends my country.
Tom never gave up.
I asked her not to interfere.
We have a big day tomorrow.
Tom's a drug addict.
We weren't hungry.
This is amazing.
Let me take a breath.
What do you know about cloning?
Where's my wallet?
Now he's watching TV.
What happened here?
Why is Tom crying?
It's a coincidence.
I'm so glad to be home.
Can we stop?
I guess that's okay.
You can frame me, torture me, and even destroy this body, but you will never enslave my mind.
It's poison.
I need to know who helped her.
It happens all the time.
I wish I could be as happy as you are.
Try this sweater.
The cat buried its claws in my hand.

Where are the guns?
Did you kiss anyone?
I'll do as you say.
I'd do anything to make money.
I recognize you now.
I don't want you to say anything you don't mean.

Let's make a deal.
I'm not going anywhere.
Well, what's the point?
Can you sign this?
He's as tall as she is.
They were being chased.
I didn't believe him.
Now you can't help us.
Do you know how much it costs?
I thought we'd go to the museum together.
Ah, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
They've been after you.
Let's go down the street.
A living soul wasn't in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary didn't speak French.
I'm not digging you wells.
I've only got a few minutes left.
Hold on a second.
Tom loves you so much.
You're a good cook.
There's no shorter way to the top, just to the breakup.
Tom's pretty weak.
His surface was flat like a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom's been paid a lot.
It was sad.
You seem to care about her.
Come and dance with me.
I already asked them all.
Automobiles are now distributed.
I can't make that decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
She went to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom's got chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to do your best.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's a new recruit.
I waved Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I have to be punished.
Who ate my dinner?
The surgeon was an older man.
I was playing tennis.
I'm thinking about helping me.
Does his aunt eat apple or banana?
You're a moron.
She was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do what I showed you?
I make kegana.
I love blue.
The girl freed the bird.
I didn't tell you to take the bribe.
Don't make my coffee.
Tom gave her a stuffed bunny to her daughter.
I think we should help him.
If there is no pornography, it will be done.
I've been ringing for hours.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me how to play gypsy?
They picked her up pretty good.
What does that mean?
I did what I could.
We have three children.
I'll give you mine, but I don't like it.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was my pleasure to spend the night with a smart, funny, and pretty girl like you.
I'm a little rusty.
The girl ran away from home and got rid of her parents' control.
Tom's a mess.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census was held in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you were gonna text me tonight, but you lied to me, obviously.
Guess.
He's dressed up to bathe.
A river of sweat started pouring on my face.
Mary gave up moral values and became a nihilistic woman.
Let's just talk about it.
I'm learning math.
The pianos are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How were you?
The movies are a great party.
I didn't see anything at first.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me love the jazz.
They're staring at you.
I'd do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning on leaving.
How many guests do we expect tonight?
He's in the hospital.
Looks like I misjudged him.
I appreciate your help with this.
Everyone was smiling.
I didn't ask for your opinion.
Our flight was cancelled due to adverse weather conditions.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom was sitting patiently.
The singers use microphones to make their voices louder.
It's possible they're coming back.
I'm so scared!
The whole board's against it.
The world illuminates the sun.
His argument was logical.
Come here right now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly true.
I'm gonna go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom made himself a tree.
Oh, well, that's great.
Avoid bad associations.
The airport's nearby.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut my finger.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
There's no drum coming out.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to keep Mary safe.
Mary wants to have hot coffee, and Tom wants to have milk.
I gave you a fake address.
I took off.
I'm not angry anymore.
There's a good chance Jane's coming.
I'm lazy.
I think so.
I think you panicked.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl has a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
I care what you think of Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom's been hanging around.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
What's gonna be my lawyer?
The nuns are singing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom started talking.
Tom doesn't look so good.
I'll really try to be nice to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where's Tom going to buy?
It looked awful.
They're all liars.
How can someone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
Everything's quiet again.
It's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Take off your shoes.
I'm in a lot of trouble right now.
Answer me right now.
Let me help.
Tom's got anger issues.
Get him.
You're paying me very well.
I feel like a whole new man.
Get me a drink.
I think I'm cold.
The question is whether it can or not.
Tom ran upstairs.
Tom will kill me when he finds out what I've done.
He's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you only dated girls who were lower than you.
I need to tighten my seat belt.
Tom almost got into a fight with Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get some burgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This is no place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He built a new house.
I wasn't expecting you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I sleep standing up.
I'm getting weaker.
Cake looks good.
Did someone break your heart?
That's how I feel.
What made you sad?
We want to see Tom.
Where the hell was Tom?
Who won the prize?
Please come on time.
The Germans have a softer attitude toward the goal.
Now we can't help her.
Please don't move.
You can't deny that.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's asleep.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you don't want to help us?
When their leader died, they put his body in a large tomb.
Women like men with mustaches.
Did you forget your wallet again?
Do you take a tip?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do it, then who does?
I wish I could be like Tom.
Suddenly I heard a loud thunderstorm.
They both screamed.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I wasn't lucky.
His body was grown with brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I'm so pissed off, Tom.
The week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The islanders are friendly.
Let's try it first with Tom.
I've always liked mystery characters.
Throw me the ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What's with the hat?
Tom is one of America's most famous songwriters.
It couldn't have been a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't bother Tom.
Tom wanted to never come back here again.
No one likes crying.
She was crying for a toy.
He tried to climb the far mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I'd do that if I could.
Tom's really fucked.
Try to explain that to Tom.
We got there first.
I already gave her your number.
The soap burned my eyes.
I'm glad to see you all again.
Tom loved Mary very much.
Tom tried the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'm happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This isn't the right way.
I know I can do more.
You're a fast learner.
We ate a lot of nice food.
Tom's been unemployed for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
I got beat up.
No one's gonna bother you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one.
Look out the window.
Mary bought a stinking garbage bag.
I'm suffering from asthma.
He got used to working in the garden for two hours a day.
Tom rarely comes out.
Tom caught malaria when he was traveling to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where Tom hid the diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom's passport is out.
You deserve a medal.
They're very strong.
How did you make such a mistake?
It's a good memory.
Can he do whatever he pleases?
It's time to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really warm.
We're bringing them bad news.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I planned to vote for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't know French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom's still not entirely aware of what happened.
Cocaine is a drug.
This is a little harder.
You seem to know the answer.
Could you get us out of here?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood looted the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns this ship?
Yeah, so?
I asked where Tom is.
It was of great use to us.
What do you usually do in your spare time?
I'll come and save you.
I got a rock in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We fucked.
Who made the doll?
I didn't lose hope for a moment.
Her long hair was bonely brown.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please give him a chance.
I'm never looking for hands.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't go in my room.
We're getting started.
I didn't mean to brag.
There was no need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the post office with him.
What's wrong with him?
I want someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I've got some doughnuts.
I teach French.
Don't let me see you.
It was too late.
I live on the bottom floor.
Girls won't play tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was reckless.
Mary broke up our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to get them to stop.
I enjoyed Tom's ingenuity.
We need to call Tom.
They'll hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went to the woods to walk.
Let's just leave him alone.
I never wear suits.
The heat's broken.
He's gone.
His clients are mostly poor.
None of us were right.
Find the differences.
That's terrible.
Why is that bothering you?
Tom says he wants to do it, too.
Women like men with mustaches.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
I don't give a shit about them.
People die all the time.
He's got a perfect way of standing up for him.
Can you make it stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
He's ruining his clothes.
You took out your sword.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom didn't want to go.
Tom's acting a little down this morning.
Nobody understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom kicked the brains out.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss the subject with you.
Did you ask for money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works at a bank.
Death, in any form, is disgusting.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger the more honor.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
Add the onions.
We're old friends.
Tom pulled out his hat and politely bowed down.
That's one reason.
Give me back my book, I need it again.
Marco thinks it's a work of art.
Tom looked.
My ears are ringing.
I take advantage of the opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very good-looking.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such a jerk!
Who's making him breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom's complicated.
Tom didn't want to knock.
Tom was suspended.
They were getting warmer.
She's gonna be a teacher.
I have no intention of telling Tom that.
I'd like marinated fish and seafood.
I was terrible.
Tom looks like a mess.
Something's weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That is all we know about them.
Do you think that bothered us?
Maybe we can get help in the nearest village.
We hope it's okay.
You're capable, but you're confusing.
He's been working at the embassy for three months.
We're on vacation now.
Maybe we'll have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom got violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this alone.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom's gonna get mad.
It's work.
We'll figure it out.
Commendation motivates students to work hard.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom unlocked the car door.
I don't agree with that.
Stop wasting my money.
Tom's about thirty years old.
What's the matter?
I see how upset you are.
Okay, I'll order it.
We'll figure it out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
Dan was attacked by two men.
Tom was measured on the scale.
Something must have happened to Tom.
Tom has changed a lot since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom raised his nose.
Tom seems a little shaken up.
He's fucked.
I'm just so proud of you.
At the time, the title "lady" was used only for nobles.
Tom has been studying French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak for yourself.
Can you believe that?
How do you choose only one man?
I came here to feed Tom the fish.
Actually, I came here to help you.
I can't feel it.
My poor uncle was there, stretched out on the bloody bed, with a dagger buried deep in the heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
I get paid to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
It couldn't be more secure.
How long will you stay with us?
You must be so proud.
You used to be so funny.
Could you stay for a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She slipped the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I hear your kid laugh.
Tom suspected that Mary and I were making something.
Just leave us alone.
Tom's pretty skinny.
Tom usually wins the fights.
You can handle this.
Did you hear the thunderstorms?
Don't mess things up and enjoy it.
I work in Boston now.
He put a crown on the king's head.
Tom held his breath.
Tom was busy working.
I'll introduce you.
I'm glad you're okay.
Your patent's unlocked.
This is one of mine.
Nothing's stopping us.
Tom's sweating.
Tom got up from the couch.
Don't piss Tom off.
I turned the fan on and I pointed it at the wall.
This is a home jam.
Tom asked for Mary’s help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
Police found Tom's corpse in a shallow grave behind the barn.
Tom writes very well.
That's not entirely true.
Rats are small.
Please stay close.
We're done talking.
I brought you some water.
Let him bark like a dog.
I'm sick of Boston.
Tom had a severe headache.
As soon as he saw him, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked inside.
Tom was driving in the back seat.
The bank lent the company a million dollars.
I still have a lot to tell you.
I always write it down.
What are the conditions?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what matters to you and I will do my best to destroy it.
Play more relaxed.
My son always stops me talking.
This is Tom ringing.
I'll drive alone.
Looks like I had too much to drink yesterday.
Tom was doing it.
Tom said he didn't remember his name.
I'll get to your baby.
That was pretty funny.
Tom closed the door.
I'm interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have to lend me an interesting book?
Tom was moving cautiously.
Just go inside.
He's pulling a sword out of steel.
I moved to a new house last week, and yesterday I studied the library.
I said my own thing.
You're funny.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut his nose off.
When are we gonna see each other?
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
Tom's an only child.
The woman calls him the man.
Tom really found something interesting.
They had so much more than us.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't believe you.
What did Tom want to see?
I'm so scared.
Dan's going mad.
I don't even know what it is.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't take it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What's their point?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all this stuff.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You'll feel better.
The rules are as follows.
This is the pool Tom learned to swim in.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to wait for me in front of the mail.
Which college did you go to?
It's about integrity.
Please don't fire my hand.
I'd better call him back.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't fuck with Tom.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
Wipe your eyes.
Tom just walked in.
A blood vessel broke in my eye.
There she visited Mary yesterday.
You overdid her!
There's a son who's gone missing.
I'm trying to work.
What kind of taste do you want?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a feeling the show's gonna give up; they didn't sell much cards.
Tom's coming.
Tom thinks he shouldn't use deodorant.
Does Tom often swim?
The girl fell asleep.
Go do your homework.
Don't make the kid eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're laughing.
Tom paid me.
I'm tired of reading books.
He was executed.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted to have a lot of kids.
Tom's acting stupid.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Tell me the details.
Tom was very warm.
We must always support our children.
Everyone has their own flaws.
Tom was sitting behind the wheel.
What do we do with them?
Tom knew what Mary was planning for dinner.
What are you looking at here?
I have the impression it rains all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom seem upset?
They'll probably come by car.
I'm grateful.
You've already got a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had one less suitcase than me, she complained that she had too much to wear.
I really miss them.
You're terrible.
Where does he live at all?
Mary's a real expert.
Excuse me for a moment.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with the light on.
There's too much acid in orange.
Tom came to help.
It's been too long.
I had a hamster named Cookie.
Tom's on a business trip.
Tom said he was going to pour the doll.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're very lonely.
Please don't add any comments.
That was Tom's only flaw.
Do you remember what you wore when I met you?
The lightning usually joins the lightning.
Tom wants tea with cinnamon.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I go with Tom?
Tom looks nervous.
I've got a little fever.
Tom stabbed him on the ground.
This show's not over!
The glasses are in the glass cabinet.
Give us some time.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't want to talk to him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time for a change.
You should wear a helmet while driving a motorcycle.
We're worried about him.
Tom's British.
John and Eve are best friends.
I'm as strong as you are.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the psychiatrist.
How come you haven't slept yet?
Everybody knows I hate her.
He's incapable of doing it.
Tom didn't have the guts to try and do it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They made love.
I burned the garbage.
We both saw him.
That would be rude.
Tell us where they are.
Tom is a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
There are only two seasons in the tropical region.
I think I made a nice statement.
I'm replacing her.
Look at the watch.
Isn't this great?
Tom said Mary's down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Are you thinking about them?
Actually, I'm back with my ex-boyfriend.
Just do this job.
I think Tom's wonderful.
Tom got a little pie.
What's Tom doing?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he can play tennis, but he doesn't want to.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What does the sign above the door say?
Sit down.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
My hair and how it holds my head reminds me of Mary.
Don't disturb my path.
Now we're looking for them.
My shoes are on.
Tom would've returned.
She always works hard.
Which country are you a citizen of?
The ivory trade is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'm meeting Tom.
I prefer cats' dogs.
There's still some space in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary's been painting her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom still doesn't know how to swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How much language do you speak?
I know you cared a lot about Tom.
I was home alone.
I should have asked her first.
Tom's the father.
You know what I need.
It doesn't support this heat.
Looks like these two have settled down.
I'm afraid I can't let that happen.
I need you right away.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't even have a broken money.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You're brave, aren't you?
I can do better than that.
I didn't mean it like that.
Did Tom do something?
I see you're awake.
Keep up the good work.
When do you close?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a loner, you can say that.
Can not get folder: %s: %s
Looks like we're gonna have to work harder.
Shouldn't we go look for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to his party?
I'm looking for them now.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you doing in Boston?
At first, I didn't understand anything.
I went to a bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree floats.
We'll keep in touch.
We're almost together.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary call John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom never sits around long enough.
Go with the bags.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everyone was talking.
I'm so proud of you.
Tom was looking for the drawers in the kitchen.
Many people in Africa died as a result of the storm.
What are you wearing?
I'll get over you.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you call her?
Louder.
Then the forest was quiet.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin condition.
She was depressed.
We're playing with destiny.
I thought he had bigger tits.
Maybe I'll be ready to leave soon.
Tom can't sympathize.
There's still some tea in the teapot.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Buddhism Is Religion or Philosophy?
The noise made me nervous.
This is justified.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know some things.
Was it all just a dream?
I'm too excited to get to Pluto soon.
"I see," the blind man said.
Everyone laughed at me on the beach.
Tom turned into a pop.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he lived here before.
Why is he like that, Tom?
I'm having trouble with the sinuses.
I had low expectations of him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you that.
Tom ran out of water.
Esperanto doesn't belong to anyone.
She's an expert in handling a saw.
Turn it off.
I'm not sharing my real name on any web site.
He's been beating on the plan.
I don't want to lie.
"Time is not money." "Time is life."
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I have three Chads.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
It's been raining for a week, about.
He recovers slowly from the disease.
I want a warp.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom looked really pissed.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Step away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly's on the ceiling.
Her face was maimed with sperm.
Tom's fair.
This is what you need to do first.
We met around noon.
Nothing's happening to me tonight.
Get him a drink.
Thank you.
Thanks for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We're eating apples.
Is that moral?
Do you know what that looks like?
Pretend you won.
I'm so confused.
They were waiting outside.
He was lazy and irresponsible, so they ordered him to leave the firm.
I'd understand what you're talking about.
Tom's trying to become a teacher.
I wish you a nice week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people in the house?
Tom has to leave now.
Why did God make me so ugly?
Why do you blame them?
It's too expensive.
We're being childish.
Tom was a barefoot.
Tom would enjoy this.
Tom went upstairs.
Let's go outside and talk.
I don't remember what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what started now.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
The neck broke the tire.
We made trees.
This is much better.
I'll make her take your lawn off.
Tom's good at math.
Tom pulled his money from the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You have to sit down.
Harder, so much better.
You can rest.
I eat with the kids every week.
Tom has always been stubborn.
You bake bread in your ovens.
You're Brooke.
Your sons are pretty hot.
I know how much it's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We ate lobster and steak.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school in spite of her illness.
Tom tried to help me.
They took the door.
Tom came to stay with us for a few days last spring.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was the other night.
That is so terrible.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them apples.
I can't argue with that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I don't have any use for that.
He hasn't left yet.
Give me an example.
I should definitely buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, call me back.
Was he sincere?
The Pilgrim was empty.
Don't talk.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't let go.
They're close.
Mom and Dad aren't coming with me.
The vampire's alive in the coffin.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I've done my job.
We'll deal with them.
Please move fast.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'm gonna call somebody.
Where should these documents be handed over?
Tom's got a bruise on his eye.
Tom's firm is in danger.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom's wrong.
She hates running.
I couldn't call you.
Is it true?
I know you're angry.
When I arrived this morning, Tom was still in his pajamas.
If I shower with hot water, the mirror will be darkened in the bathroom.
Tom took a picture.
Tom thought Mary was gonna be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can smile at me.
Unfortunately, I don't have enough money for me right now.
"Are you vegetarian?" "No, and you?"
Lightning hit the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
It's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father died.
They raised my salary again.
I'll never even get in there again.
I'm making a movie.
I forgot your number.
Tom's got work to do.
What should we do today?
Do you believe in a horoscope?
I know how to go.
I'll bring it.
You were a disaster!
Tom's good at his profession.
I made it all up.
I'd like to know why they deleted my name from the list.
Tom set all this up.
I'm not betraying her.
Flowers attract bees.
The water's quiet.
Before that, there was no plant life in this palate.
You're incompetent.
What was Tom's answer?
You'll do as I say.
Who's gonna believe you?
Who are you dating?
Who are we?
It was worth a shot.
I did what I had to do.
Tom is very far away.
Tom wants to write.
Tom's very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
Yeah, well?
I have a great interest in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I can't give him these.
I'm not taught that.
She's got tight hips.
I don't ovulate.
Maybe Tom's not telling the truth.
Will you vote for him?
The famous critic and poet travel together.
There's no time to explain.
Are they going to arrest me?
Unfortunately, it violates all the rules.
Why aren't you home?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Come on, beer.
There's a certain Mr. Kimura waiting for you on the line.
Men and women are men of the opposite sex.
That's basically true.
I know Tom didn't play fair.
The wound was leaking manure.
No, and it's not even under the capital.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't stand it.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.
Tom must feel lonely.
What did you want on the Internet?
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom the money.
Our solar system is constantly on the move.
I couldn't find her.
Tom threw them to Mary's desk.
Tom did this.
I'm learning art history.
I don't exactly agree.
What's on the agenda?
There's plenty more.
Looks like these two are dating again.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom doesn't speak French very well yet.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're strangers.
A moral choice is whether to translate something or not. Some things are better left in the language he has produced.
You're ugly.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you should ask for Tom's permission.
You look beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
Do I look normal?
Are you going to eat?
I need a box of nails.
I did it.
Look around.
Pass me the French key.
Tom seems upset.
It was an ambush.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom got the lottery.
I was impressed by Tom's politeness.
Tom has no hope.
Tom's wearing glasses.
I'll keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
There was a big crowd at the party.
Because orbit is oval, the distance between planets and the sun constantly varies.
That's what Tom told me.
Tom looked Mary deep into her eyes and smiled.
It was very cozy in that room, because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
Everything's fine.
The stars are shining.
Really?
I can touch the floor with my hands without bending my knees.
Tom's a white man.
Tom could do better.
That's not why I called you, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
Find them.
I couldn't sleep.
That's good enough for him.
Tom's home.
You'll be known over time.
I don't know them.
Tom was brutally murdered on October 20th, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait anymore.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We can have lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to do that.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
You're a skater.
We'll go shopping.
Tom knew Mary would like John.
Tom's grumpy.
I just saw my finger.
I'm gonna go ask Tom.
My head hurts.
I wouldn't recommend that.
We only have one life.
Why does he have to go, Tom?
Would he lie to you?
He has a passive character.
It's possible someone was following her.
My wife was here once.
It's a powder cure.
We were going down the coast.
I don't want you harassing them.
Depends on your decision.
That's manageable.
Tom reacted badly.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
Tom was trying to figure you out.
It's not attractive.
Few people understand that.
You're very cut off.
Aren't you a banker?
She found great satisfaction in getting to know her great - grandson.
That's our best chance.
It smells like flowers.
Tom snooped.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom grabbed a fire extinguisher and started snooping.
It's good for tennis.
I wasn't even in Boston the night Tom was killed.
I need you for a second.
Have as much fun as you can!
Whose are these?
Speak for yourself.
It resulted in major difficulties.
She slowly developed hatred for me.
I don't think you've got a frame for that.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
So we didn't agree?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't stand it.
I'll never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I'm wrong.
My computer went off.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right there.
You forgot your backpack!
Indeed, a conscience makes us all cowards.
There's no need to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I don't expect anything less than perfection.
I think that hotel will be a little expensive for you.
Tom picked up the box.
I should have checked.
He couldn't take his pants off.
I don't have to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom didn't want to help me.
You made a mistake.
We're glad to see you.
You must leave now, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom visited Boston.
The screen emits green light.
English became my favorite object.
Things happened fast.
Where's the evidence?
When we woke up this morning, we faced terrible news.
The knee wound is rotting now.
Wipe your eyes.
Mary was scared.
None of your business!
Tom wouldn't do anything.
Tom's an agricultural worker.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to be enjoying himself.
Maybe Tom will hear you out.
How long has Tom been asleep?
Our job is to help them.
He suffered great losses.
Tom just needs some rest.
What are you eating, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a mint candy?
Why would Tom do that to us?
I don't even want to know.
They'll do it.
I'm gonna have to spend the night here.
I almost cut myself.
I'll get down here.
We're paranoid.
This isn't silver.
A blood vessel broke into his brain.
How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't the kind of guy you could put up with.
I don't want pork.
She wants to run.
I need a sea nut.
This was a preconceived crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
Tom rereads the note.
The children drew pictures of the sidewalk with chalk.
You're wondering what took so long.
Did you get an answer from him?
I need to take her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I went to Boston twice.
Tom married 26 years old.
We've already cleared that up.
You want me to pick you up at the airport?
We're playing with the computer.
No, and it's not under the capital.
Tom and I are drinking buddies.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he hears something.
Tom is always trying to do what he thinks is right.
Tom doesn't seem to understand what's going on.
Come visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She wants to boast about the magnificent lustres she has in the house.
I'm not a local.
What's in the plate?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's happening right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
Who's your favorite nail polish?
I'm studying piano.
They need the money.
It's a good swim.
You won't find us.
I heard from her.
You stay out of this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as I needed to finish this.
I was watching TV when Tom came in.
You don't.
Do you think you can stop me?
It's actually quite a lot.
I've decided to forgive them.
I know you know.
Did I do something to get Tom mad at me?
The triangles don't have four angles.
There's not enough reading light here.
Tom's counting on Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary turned the lipstick off.
I guess.
Tom's ashamed of me.
Guess what you told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let's keep this between us.
I've asked everywhere.
I'll talk.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everyone's waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon is coming back.
Tom's wearing John's shirt.
He found his parents.
He gave us a questionable answer.
Wake me up as soon as it's light.
Mr. Gorbachev, break down this wall!
Tom seems surprised.
Tom stepped in.
That's how it's supposed to be.
Let's try and get on with it.
That'll be hard.
I don't like retirement.
Thanks for asking.
I have good reason not to love Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll look into it right away.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
The rooms are abandoned.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter was not to be sent at all.
The girl wearing a scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks old?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's coming.
I don't think Tom's gonna fight much.
What are you talking about?
I'll call him right away.
That's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for an abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers like?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The prince inherits the throne.
You're not gonna find me.
Are those my glasses?
I know that for sure.
I've never felt this affectionate.
I can't control her.
She's freaking me out.
I'll be back in time.
It's not an emergency.
I'll pick her up now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I don't care about all of you.
I'll go with the subway.
I didn't get an answer from them.
I'm not exactly Tom's favorite.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom's coming.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom's going to school with a car.
Did you see that?
I'll have to think about this carefully.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everyone's talking about me.
Do you ever think about us?
Do you write the words?
It was a great show.
We have to go find them.
I was home last Friday night when I was 13 years old.
Tom knows Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off your hat.
I don't know what you think it's gonna change.
That's what I'm doing for him.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
He just made me feel bad.
What did Tom find now?
We stayed up all night trying to figure out a plan.
Tom's mad at me.
Tom's going to sleep.
Let's protect our peace!
Tom is well-armed.
We took care of each other.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting started.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said to stay here.
I'm not armed.
Is that how much you hate them?
We have to buy him a gift.
I know what happened at school today.
I have a glass of beer to fill my thirst.
Tom got here on time.
Today is boring TV.
Oh, beautiful!
Tom found a four-leaf dent.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom looks really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She gave up smoking.
Tom found evidence.
We got up to say hello to them.
Did you smoke?
All visitors must be examined.
Where did you get that scar?
You're nothing.
We're not gonna find them.
The association was founded in the 1990s.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds totally valid.
It's the law!
Water penetrates the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please write that down.
Tom came safely.
I can stay.
I don't see customers complaining.
Here, I want challenges.
He's not sitting on a bench.
I should have done it yesterday.
We're so much alike with Tom.
Tom's not my cousin.
Watch out for the sparks flying out of the fire.
It's just made up.
Tom's been banging Mary all night.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I dream about you all the time.
Let's find out more about her.
I won't tell anyone your secret unless you tell me I can.
Let's get a soul together.
I'm sure he'll pass the exam that's coming.
We're going to Boston.
Tom's a good dad.
Stay here, okay?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He really kissed her in the mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three cans of bug spray.
It was gross.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom turned into a werewolf.
I bought these drugs for my father.
Kids love cakes.
He's been pretty held up.
I can handle Tom.
Tom's pissed off.
This is from us.
In an emergency, what number should I call?
I still want a horse.
I didn't touch it.
Who's in charge here?
He admitted he had to lie.
Mary got Tom all the money.
Enough of this nonsense.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
Tom always wanted a son.
Tom's got a big mouth.
That sounds like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom's been snooping around.
The butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom left work early.
We have everything.
I baked him these cookies.
When does the school year end?
You're right from the start.
How did you do that without our help?
Why didn't you say "bye"?
How much instrument do you know how to play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last one.
I haven't found them yet.
They're ignoring me.
Hold on to the fence.
These must be fakes.
Beauty cannot be established objectively but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom's unstoppable.
His girlfriend's weak.
Tom and I are engaged.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom's always here.
You left me in despair.
Tom screaming, waking up from the nightmare.
Tom's got a weak look.
The scar wasn't working, so he couldn't get a picture in the dark.
We agreed to start right away.
Is it done?
Everyone wants lasting peace.
We met the other day.
Where did you start with Tom?
Is it hot coffee?
Tom untied his eyes.
The tribe was not happy that a peacemaker was coming.
Open up.
Put your apron on.
It's possible you're wrong.
I baked some cake.
Tom's got a plantation.
Why is Tom still at school?
It's been an honor.
I talked to my advisors about which items to take.
I've already written everything that was supposed to be written.
Don't worry about me.
We can rest.
Boston's worth seeing.
There's no one in the classroom right now.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe Tom was the one who stole Mary's bike.
Is Dan aware of what he's done?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say what year you want.
Tom doesn't have any friends.
Who lives in this room?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice guy.
I never change my bedtime schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, come here.
Have you seen him?
Tom wasn't sure of anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst thing that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll give you a ride.
I set up Tom.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something to Tom in her ear.
Tom can be very vengeful.
I've seen it happen.
We're gonna miss Tom so much.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't do anything like this before.
You're very bold.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Dadeba really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Did you call Google?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just showering.
Tom's probably in the kitchen.
Tom's back with him.
That's what you need.
I fell in love with you.
We're models.
What do you want?
Tom got a new job.
Tom won't be back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack up.
That responsibility for him is a burden.
Tom's still playing golf, isn't he?
I've had too much to eat today.
Pop music is my favorite kind of music.
Half an hour has passed.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was amazing.
I can't see a thing.
He's a pretty nasty man!
They crucified their tent on the beach.
That's not what I wanted at all.
It's better to be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
The two brothers are musicians.
Tom seems jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and hung another one in that place.
Stop!
Want some cheese?
I'll get her for you.
He's getting tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
Cows are by no means clear.
That was very careless of Tom.
It's stupid.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I'm mad.
Let them sew you up.
Secing is a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehab.
They'll pay them well.
Tom's probably out.
We weren't fighting.
Tom looked inside.
At the same time, you are both heavy and easy, and pleasant and bitter; I cannot live with or without you.
Let's just say for now that you're right.
Tom's doing great.
I don't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about that.
I'll see you later.
It's warm in here.
That's disappointing.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in town.
You have to try, Tom.
I wish I understood.
Tom's a spineless man.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
We missed you.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do so.
They all look alike.
Don't forget it.
We have to find them first.
I'm running a bill.
Tom hit Mary on the head with this.
Tom's gonna kill you.
We'd better both get some sleep.
I always mix those two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is very fusier written.
You need to help them.
Tom wasn't crying.
He wrote a book, and that's great.
Tom turned the hook.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I've got ghosts coming up.
I was tired and cold.
Nothing is more pitiful than stupidity and indifference.
They're all screwed.
Tom wasn't protesting.
What's the website from?
Vampires live forever.
They both laughed.
What's in your hand?
She's a young student.
They're compassionate.
I hate tattlejans.
I didn't say I did it.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
Been cleaning snow all day.
His paralysis is getting worse, and soon, he won't be able to get out of bed.
Do you want to race?
I need Tom.
Change is never easy.
Is Boston far?
They pay me to help you.
This jacket's too small for me.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could get it ready by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston on a plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very effective.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll slow down later this afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train while he was at work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the tap out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
There's a guard coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't let me wait!
Tom gave me the picture that was stuck on the chimney.
Doves symbolize peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
Traitor!
I will do everything for the good of mankind.
Did you really stay home all night?
Anya's music is beautiful.
Is she a cab driver?
I must be losing my hearing.
It's over now.
I'm getting sleepy.
It's not scientifically proven that there's a connection between the character and the blood type.
She sounded angry.
Frankly, Tom wasn't trying hard enough.
It's from England.
Is there anyone who disagrees?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom's brave.
Avoid smoking too much.
Tom's a hairdresser.
I pressed the button to turn the radio on.
We're playing computer.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a male product.
We've been looking everywhere for them.
I love your website.
I'll get you.
Press this button.
Tom really knows how to fight.
What's really bothering her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom threw his car around.
You've got to get over the difficulties.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All lizards carry eggs.
We'll do something.
I think Tom's cruel.
You didn't answer my letter.
We calmed down.
You look disoriented.
The bread is baked in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad.
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I see the way things are.
I make a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Hold on a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where's Tom headed?
This is very similar to mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, come outside.
His words sound reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for more money.
Tom wants adventures.
They don't have a shed.
A lot of trees have collapsed.
The lions don't know color.
That wasn't true.
The answer's messed up.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're too far from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look over here.
I want my money back right now.
Tom believed Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a really good time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try to do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we both lied.
I was happy here.
Only a few passengers survived the accident.
I can imagine you being married to Tom.
Tom's being polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary's doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm lower than you.
I'll quote you a passage from one of those letters.
Tom noticed his wallet was gone.
The woman was sitting between two men.
Why do cows survive?
I've got a gnome coming out of my right ear.
Cardboard boxes are fragile.
My stomach hurts at meals.
We're really in danger.
Tom never told me he didn't speak French.
These guys didn't get names.
It's fair.
I'm here to study.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
Attaching the calendar to the wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone ever loved you.
We packed their bags.
What couldn't you sleep with last night?
They gave us a curse.
Did you get the invitation from Tom?
Just turn it around.
You can't deny that.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What's the text about?
Tom wrote Mary a letter and thanked her for the help.
I've decided to go.
They eat sandwiches.
Turtles live a long time.
Tom is a strong man.
Tom sleeps very tight.
Are you helping him?
Looks like she's drunk.
You can talk later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, I remember.
Did you get here with a car?
I don't know the end of the story.
It's all over.
I'm sure.
Can you wait a minute?
You're among friends.
You've got something on your mind.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you call?
The question is who will make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start over.
It was a hot night.
Thank you for receiving me.
Susan's actually your half-sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I'd rather have eggs from the undersea.
Can you explain that?
Where's his house?
Love is for lunatics.
Why would I help him?
Tom turned his shoes on.
We've lost faith in humanity.
Tom shakes hands with the manager.
Actually, I was born in Boston.
And how am I to blame for that?
Why does everyone hate us?
Tom lent me some money.
Am I disturbing you?
End violence; fight for peace.
Watch me do it.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom gets it.
Well, just let me know.
Most plants died.
Hold on, Tom.
You're very helpful.
Tom can't talk to us yet.
They're gonna love it.
I'm gay.
Let me see what I can do.
Tom wants cheese.
Can I buy you dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him to swim.
I should take a look.
Come on, Dick, it's time for dinner.
I'm on my way.
He was driving fast.
You can use my car.
Just relax.
Tom had a daughter.
Maybe Tom will at least apologize.
He's sucking up to the boss.
The following morning, he found a letter written manually in the mailbox.
Come inside.
Is anybody sitting here?
I have to cut my spending this month.
No one's talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating.
Have you paid yet?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom's wiping his face.
What good do I have from you?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
It burns when he wears that dress.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
Now they live on the floor under this one.
They believed me.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to the wedding.
I tried to explain to him, but he didn't press.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
The dolphins are a bunch of mammals.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Tom might be alive.
Will the future be like science fiction?
Tom's laughing at you.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
He opened the door even though I told him not to open it.
That narrows it down.
It's not hard to point out if you're surrounded by fools.
Tom asked us to babysit him.
I underlined the word "Alice" to point it out.
Third happiness.
We have to throw up.
This is an airy test popular in the Philippines.
Nobody said anything.
Let us strive for virtues and give up vices.
You're smart.
I'm against projects.
Wasn't he tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom listened to Mary.
I'm a zombie!
I'm too late.
I could have known Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom's pretty safe.
There are writing reports.
It hurts here.
You're making Tom nervous.
Where are we headed?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just be careful with that.
I was just teasing you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to get some sleep now and finish tomorrow.
You jumped a button.
Diseases often occur at the most uncomfortable time.
This dog is staring at me like he's trying to eat me.
They were beasts dressed in human skin, and they were not real people at all.
The man's starving.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
Everything is fleeting, but the good memories remain.
Say what you want.
What do you want for a drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What were you thinking, Tom?
It was really nice.
Everybody dies sometime.
I know how to stay calm.
We love beauty.
I mean it all day long.
I suggest we focus on looking for a way out of this cave.
They don't trust me.
Dan wrote Linda another check.
That's right, people!
This building is a magnificent building.
Tom wasn't disappointed.
Do you know how to write?
I think you did it on purpose.
I got this fax from her.
Black cats bring bad luck.
Tom told me a secret.
We're flying over the clouds.
I love it!
Is this true in English?
Let's follow him.
Tom handed Mary a towel.
She's got big ears.
Give her a chair.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn't really know how to answer that question.
This is a ginger drink.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only 18 years old.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom wondered what Mary would say.
I don't like the sound of that.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try.
I'm not misunderstood.
Tom's safe.
I'll wait for Tom.
I assume you read my report.
Tom's back off.
Don't do it again.
The black ones are maggots.
Maybe we'll find something.
You look really good.
You blew up Tom.
Warm him up.
Tom looked like he was indignant.
What else can Tom do?
I want to become physically and mentally stronger.
She's a lively girl.
If I could stay, I'd stay.
Please, stop.
There's no hot water.
I bought you a dragon.
Tom sounded upset.
They're starting to go.
Do you have a map from Boston?
Don't mind if you don't.
"I got a nine on the chemistry test.
You were lucky to have survived the attack.
Tom didn't seem to be in a hurry.
Tom was a showy guy.
How was the dance?
I'm a student.
It's okay. It's okay.
I don't understand why Tom wants to go to Boston.
I'm taking Tom for a walk.
I don't like being alone.
I fell in love with you the first day I met you.
You always leave your bike dirty.
She moved here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have professional experience?
I wasn't asking you.
Let's have lunch.
I guess I was a fool expecting you to do something.
You are my pride and joy.
What would you say?
Make two lines.
The titles should draw the attention of readers.
He was sitting in front of me.
I'd rather die than obey.
I actually work here.
Tom's suffering.
I don't have to call anyone.
I like the way you dress.
I could stay with you.
It worked.
I saw a French film with an English translation.
Tom was making fun of Mary.
Tom's full of confidence again.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother says the child's diseases are fake.
Dan had a rough relationship with Linda.
Everyone's back.
Do you have a violin?
Give us a call.
Maybe Tom could sing us a wedding.
Which one would Tom choose?
The hospital isn't that big there.
Most people have to work to support themselves.
Nothing ever changes.
Mary's pregnant.
We'll stay.
I don't scare their dog.
I didn't sleep right.
I don't want to, and I can't serve in a political party.
Girls enter puberty between the ages of ten and eleven, and boys between the ages of eleven and twelve.
It's on its way.
Tell Tom he mustn't forget to renew his passport.
The sky's about to explode.
It's cold to touch.
He thought someone put poison in his soup.
Many do this.
I still can't tell you.
Mary decided to buy a blue dress.
She's been mugged.
It was really cheap.
Marriage scares people.
Was the door closed?
I've got a big sailboat.
Why can't you come?
The inhabitants rebelled against the ruler.
Let's talk to Tom.
He likes strange animals, like snakes.
We need leaders.
It's his first day at school.
Don't pull yourself together when you get home.
Tom taught me to sing.
"What book are you reading?" "Roman."
You're burning the car.
That gun's not a toy, boy!
Half the species is married.
They're staring at him.
That's for them.
That's Tom's dog.
Where's the reed?
The room smelled bad.
I don't want to hate you.
I have to leave again.
What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk to me.
I want to do community service to redeem myself for everything I've done.
Tom tied his ropes.
Are you still afraid of spiders?
I don't have any complaints.
I still don't understand women.
Is Tom conscious?
Tom's beautiful.
This sentence can be interpreted in many different ways, which I should have taken into account when translating.
He's a werewolf.
I knew you'd like that restaurant.
Do you poison the axles?
The kidnappers blindfolded them.
You're lying, Tom.
Who stole my keys?
Dan invited Linda to a student party.
Mary has a lot of support.
Tom's in danger now.
I give you my word.
Who's gonna pay the rent?
You're a little rude.
Hey, put that back.
I wanted Tom to come.
Does Mary like Tom?
I've been waiting for you outside.
I want my money back.
Tom doesn't do it.
Tom wanted Mary to take John to the library.
Let's find out who stabbed Tom.
Tom knows the candy.
You've seen what I can do.
We have a lot of money.
Does it suit your age?
Can I have a menu?
It is not all honey and milk in Canada.
I have information on this.
Tom smothered himself.
Do you understand the difference between right and wrong?
They're not stupid.
I still respect Tom.
Tom wouldn't trust anyone to do that.
His eyesight is weak.
That's my specialty.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I had a speech prepared.
Falcons have a sharp look.
I wrote them that.
I lived in Boston last year.
Tom was blowing.
We want a new carpet.
Let's share a cab.
I don't have to follow him.
Tom smiled politely.
Canicon's pretty dirty.
You need a good night's sleep.
Tom took off the rug.
They went for a walk.
This is his mother's grandfather's side.
I want specific information.
Friendships are magical.
The volcano has become active again.
Tom told me he needed to take care of some things.
How does that help?
Dan probably killed Linda by suffocating her.
The small island looks like a turtle from a distance.
Do the trout bite?
What did Tom ask?
Stop blanching.
I'm thirty years old.
His acting is by no means perfect.
It's definitely them.
Don't wait.
You don't know who else for how long.
The dog barked at him.
Let's go to a movie.
Good-looking women grow up much better than beautiful women.
Tom has sheep.
He tripped him.
Mary felt her face warm.
I know what upsets Tom so much.
I thought Tom was retired.
Tom missed it.
Please, come with me.
I can't go anywhere.
Stop following them.
Tom's a little shy.
Tell me where Tom is.
I don't mind.
Tell me again what happened.
Tom needlessly lifts his gum.
He deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not picking up any of these.
Do you think I care what you think of me?
She's been working since nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know the words?
It hurts so bad in here.
I hate this carpet.
I'm a little sick.
Tom's been interrupted.
Tom couldn't remember where he left the umbrella.
Get out of the way.
I'll get my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That thing's done.
It's unnatural.
What did you steal?
Tom will never finish the job he started.
Tom's a gentleman.
Do you have pets?
You were wrong about the picture.
I'll get it.
Tom wanted Mary and John to be kind to each other.
Tom's replaceable.
I think I'd better help him.
But you're smart.
Tom said you could use my help.
You all look so busy.
I was sure we could trust Tom.
They're all giving him a shit.
Faith involves trusting in what mind cannot hope for.
Tom was hanging out with me.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't want to help him.
You've ruined your whole life.
I couldn't imagine a world without music.
I live nearby.
There's a button on the inside of the door.
Both books are equivalent in value.
We rented a movie.
The snoring is coming back.
Tom filled the bucket to the top.
Choose your weapon.
They've chosen a new government.
"I'll wash the dishes." "Okay, I'll wash them."
I'd buy it.
He's the one who's pulling in the back.
We value our customers.
We have to follow the rules.
It's a circus!
Tom's wet.
They asked for a raise.
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
Did you know Tom was gonna be here?
The earthquake caused the fire.
Tom's not here today.
If I hadn't eaten, I'd love to have lunch with you.
What do you need, Tom?
He was gonna say something.
The heater stopped working.
I'm talking about him.
Tom knew he'd never see Mary again.
Drop your weapons.
And I'll see you tomorrow?
I'm the one you love.
We bought them those books.
That's totally possible.
I still don't know how to do that.
It's like a grease job.
It was a wonderful experience.
Tom hated them.
I want you to let Tom live.
He's playing.
Tom asked me if I liked his plan or not.
The fan's not working.
It's not my fault.
I could do nothing.
Tom thinks we don't want to go.
We believe in democracy.
Understand?
My day was full of activities.
Is this yours, Tom?
My dad's sick with the flu.
I don't wait too long.
Just look at yourself.
This is huge.
It's missing blank in front of both points.
Tom lives on this street.
You should go to a dentist.
Soldiers fired.
Tom can't stand it.
Store's closed.
You listened.
Tom's out.
This is all I can do.
He adheres to his principles.
Tom's broke.
I'm just here to help him.
Their plan sounds interesting to me.
I still remember the first time I saw you.
They've broken it down.
Tom's a big tit.
Can I put this here?
I didn't see anyone.
I'll drive you home.
Tom died of cancer.
How do you think it's gone?
Tom doesn't believe this at all.
I asked myself about them.
I'm asleep.
I'm planning on going to Boston for Christmas.
Is Tom in Boston?
It's like a eel.
You should pay your rent in advance.
Put all the trash in the barrel.
I'd love to ride with Tom.
It's time for that again.
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do it.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes."
I don't own a guitar.
I teach Chinese.
Tom was sitting on the desk.
The ship had three decks.
Tom said he'd never see me again.
Don't talk so fast.
You go pick up Tom, then come back.
I don't see a conspiracy here.
I'll give you the little money I have.
Tom wants me to give him a birthday party next Monday night.
Take the mask off.
That's one option, by the way.
You can go anywhere.
I'm bluffing.
I liked the way you danced.
I need you for a while.
We've been tricked.
Tom's the right one.
Tom seems scared.
The police will investigate the case.
Now you've made him feel better.
It's white.
Sit down.
The iron is stronger than gold.
I was wondering if you could help me tomorrow afternoon.
Tom got violent.
When does the show start?
Can I just talk to you?
We're not gonna let you die.
My shoes suck.
Tom didn't say anything about it.
It's probably true.
We had to walk home in the rain.
It's good to be alone.
Tom has a lot of money, but he doesn't have any friends.
Each color has its own meaning.
The old house was in bad shape.
I just don't feel safe about it.
I was breathless.
Can you reach those?
My dog really likes oranges.
Your shelf is full of books.
Tom didn't sleep well.
(Applause)
You've got me.
The answer is confirmed.
We knew you'd come.
I live in a city.
Let's go wake up Tom.
How am I gonna find him?
The ice melted.
I spilled blood.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I'm scared of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to get him a cup of coffee.
I always get up early.
I'm sure it's been a lot easier for you.
They never caught me.
I love my homeland.
I don't know how to write.
They stopped.
Tom can handle it.
Don't hit me.
Tom's comfortable.
Tom didn't answer my question.
The room was locked.
I can't justify it.
Tom was stealing from me.
Victory is bitter.
They're looking in the mirror.
It's not my thing to cry.
Tom wasn't tall enough to reach the top shelf.
Tom sent Marie to the door.
It looks delicious.
I have to figure it out.
You two have gone against me!
I've never worn a sleeper in my life.
Don't sleep in the tub.
Tom tried everything.
Do you have a cigarette?
Kids sleep upstairs.
I study music.
I didn't go that bad.
Why does Tom have to go to Boston?
I'm pretty proud of that.
Make sure you don't mind.
We live by the sea.
Soldiers wore steel helmets.
I'll send Tom home.
What are you guys talking about?
I guess you didn't get my message.
Tom assumed Mary caught a fish.
It's boring to sit at home.
It's not that bad.
They're peeling.
Did Tom ask why he was late?
Probably won't be worth the wait.
I have to buy a new turn for the room.
Tell Tom to write to me.
Do you want to go to work?
I couldn't stand him.
It's sunny today, but it's cold.
What is it really about?
I'm not an expert.
My greatest ambition is to become an opera singer.
Help us as much as you can.
Tom ran downstairs.
Tom gave his word.
Tom and Mary have been on our first day.
Let's go for a ride.
Girls run and play.
I'm not sure Tom did this.
"Will you not eat your spinach?" "I will eat it after."
This is my favorite object.
Tom took off the rug.
You're driving me crazy.
I'll find you Tom.
Come and talk to me, Tom.
My new boots are made of real skin and have relatively high heels.
What did you expect me to say?
I feel safe when you're with me.
Tom's singing.
Tom's not that tall.
She wears a leather belt on the bar.
They put out the fire.
They're finally gone.
Tom gave Mary a shit.
I'm gonna go look for them.
Tom came in though it was raining.
I don't want to use a dildo. I prefer real dicks.
I won't cook for him.
Why are you calling her?
You really need a shrink.
Tom gave a speech.
We're playing on Sunday.
Tom was surrounded.
You can only stay here if you're quiet.
I want to find out what happens next!
I can't believe Tom just did that.
Tom beat me up.
I didn't want you to hate me.
Haven't I told you everything?
Don't fight.
I expect help from you.
Tom's going alone.
Tom only had fives at school.
Tom agreed with me.
I'm sure your intentions are clear.
Tom used to talk too much.
My brother's out.
You were great.
I wish I could tell people my right name.
The dentist built up a temporary seal.
Tom actually laughed.
Tom's allergic to pollen.
They've contacted the local politicians.
Tom gets the notes.
They gave me this card.
We're having a discussion about the forecast.
Everyone has their own style.
That doesn't prove anything.
Can I eat an apple?
How long since Tom died?
Tom's weird.
That was very nice.
My dad gives me a $10 allowance a week.
I hear you didn't like Tom.
I'm glad you're safe.
How long did you work for them?
I need to help Tom.
Maybe Tom knows French.
Tom's stitching me up.
When was the last time you had to do this?
When you pour wine, it's convenient to wipe it with a bow, isn't it?
Men have about seven or eight times more testosterone than women.
What kind of games do you want to play?
Tom wants to know when you can come to us and help us move the piano.
Tom used to be shy.
It's cooled down.
I couldn't sleep all night.
Trust me.
I'm looking for you.
Do you want robots?
They're losing their minds.
He really burns me.
I can go anywhere I want for a year.
Tom was often abused at school.
When does it start?
The bear cares about itself.
Tom crossed the field.
I put three brown tea sugars in your tea.
I like her dark eyes.
Is it time to go?
Tom calmed down.
The glove has a hole in his thumb.
Tom always got what he wanted.
That's what I doubted.
Tom doesn't do what he needs to do.
Dan was still alive.
The universe isn't even your friend or your ghost, it's just indifferent.
We did everything we could for her.
You should buy some sugar.
What did you cook for dinner?
What did you do after that?
Take care of yourself with Tom.
There's fruit and meat in this market.
When she started talking, her voice was less dry than before.
Tom doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison.
Tom looked the other way.
Tom is the only one who can make Mary smile.
Can't you lower the price a little?
I'll wash up first.
Tom's 30 now.
I didn't ask her to go there.
I hate him.
She became a chukunba just a few days before she turned ninety-nine.
Did you ask everywhere?
It's important to have the sense that no one is ever 100% anything.
He's gesticulating while he's talking.
Sit next to me.
Tom's thrilled.
Tom never lends anyone money.
I'm truly happy for Tom.
Galileo was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1633, yet because of his age and poor health, he was allowed to serve that sentence in domestic detention.
Scientists claim that people who laugh more often live longer than those who were run over by a truck.
I talk to her a lot.
Please don't ask me about them.
Tom sharpened the tree.
The earth is still watered, and it's likely to give up the sword.
He was taking a nap.
What a collection!
They all have names.
Have you ever smoked a dick?
The dog was following me.
Those were Tom's last words.
I think Tom's gone.
He's trying to become an actress.
My plastic bottle broke.
Is this our cabin?
Let's do this.
We're too sophisticated.
I threw my money in the water.
I think that's brilliant.
Tom's very indifferent.
The skyscraper is expected to sink into the swamp.
I can give her a message.
She's a little red.
Tom is a patient man.
Tom drank too much.
I have a few questions for them.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
We have to help her.
Tom stood there and kept quiet.
I collect stamps.
We'll be in Boston tomorrow.
Do you live here?
The room looks like a mess.
I'm not talking about him.
Tom's fushering.
We don't have to go.
I'm talking to Tom.
You asked me to help.
Tom will tell you when he wants to.
I wouldn't want to talk about her.
Tom wanted Mary to leave him alone.
I already know that.
Is that a rhetorical question?
Tom is the brother of one of the victims.
The peaches are sweet.
It doesn't matter.
I like comic books.
You have a really good handwriting.
The wind kept blowing.
Meanwhile, the foolish uncle was sitting in the living room.
Did I tell you?
The bags are falling from the tree.
You got a band?
You can wait here.
I got a five in French.
I want the class to shut up.
It has to be perfectly symmetric.
Tom wants to go to the beach with us.
I voted for him last year.
The wind's blowing.
It's a risky plan.
How fast does it get from here to the post office?
I don't want to involve Tom in this.
It's no big deal.
Tom laughed at everything.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are you still dancing?
Listen carefully, you need to know this.
Are you going to disguise yourself this year?
I'll do whatever you want.
I'm not that hot either.
Do you want to talk to me?
If there is an unforgivable act, it is an act to refuse forgiveness.
The door's jammed.
Tom asked me for a glass of cold water.
How did you react to the news?
Where did Tom say he was going?
Tom betrayed Mary.
I'm thirsty for him.
He's on his way home.
I'm not even sure I remember exactly.
Tom noticed Mary watching him.
You're making me sick.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom's a nice guy.
The eagle is the king of the birds.
And then I'll call you back.
This is blackmail.
Why don't you rest?
You didn't ask why.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary.
Let's talk.
I think Tom's nice.
The sky's widened.
The gala will wake the baby.
Look straight.
That's not exactly what a man should be up for.
Tom and Mary are playing rhymes.
I've made up my mind.
Take care of our planet.
Tom leaned on Mary.
I'll call security.
Tom, you think I'd rather have a son.
How did you get here?
He picked up the book.
Don't touch my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm gonna go do it.
Tom read Mary's secret diary.
The priest will get some blood.
We've been talking for two hours.
I found out about you from him.
I know you're upset right now.
He's on his way.
He's had an appetite from a long walk.
I have to go help her.
Tom used a cup of tea and a doughnut.
Tom could tell you.
It's just not like I'm gonna make Tom swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how to do it, but Tom asked me not to tell you.
They both smiled again.
My wedding must be perfect.
Tom felt strong.
The meeting has already begun.
We want to hear it.
I really like what your hair looks like.
Are you cold out there?
You should get to bed early.
Tom was in danger.
He's addicted to pornography.
That's just stupid.
Tom's an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair's a crowbar.
Tom's the tallest guy in the class.
Tom, you grew up fast.
That was our only comfort.
Nobody would have cared.
Have you ever written in a journal today?
I just want this to never happen again.
Can I have it alone?
Is it your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to look through the key, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't stand it.
I've known the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into this right now.
Why are you twisting?
Come on, Tom.
I'll just try to get there in time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause illness.
We're almost ready.
Tom has a sharp hearing.
I bribed them.
I told you I couldn't.
Tom's books have been translated into many languages.
I'm not comfortable with him.
Tom stole your money.
Don't pull the plug.
I helped him open the table.
I ate schnitzel with potatoes last night.
It's better for your health to go down the stairs.
Tom bought a coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith sucks.
I'm sorry I even told them something.
I wouldn't have asked you if I could have found someone else.
Pick me up at two and a half.
Tom drank.
I was sleeping in the phantom.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That could work.
Aren't you cold with short sleeves?
Tom's the best.
He has an eye for art.
It was the worst party I've ever had in my life.
I need an envelope.
Tom's rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any Asal Japanese movies?
Did you get them?
French was a slang first.
Don't you ever call her?
We made them cakes.
Fingerprints of the knife's fingers determine her guilt.
Can I wait here for them?
We can look in a dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need instructions.
It was ironic.
I baked you cookies.
That can be done.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I sent Tom the schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's a real shame.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have fun going to the party.
You saved the bell.
He's got me on my head.
You have to be careful.
Tom seems to be running out of time.
You're kidding. Your youth continues.
You're free to go.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom seems lonely.
What do you mean you don't know?
That was a surprise.
Do you really think you can get here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
It smells like meat.
Demek need to know you?
Tom's cleverly covered all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
No idea.
She's running slowly.
How can you be so sure?
The picture shows bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in trouble.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it's time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just pissed Tom's room off last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a coffin, unlike most vampires.
I would have sold this dog if it were higher.
I'm going to help my friends.
Turns out there's no air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son loves rockets.
You need to hurry.
Everybody's talking.
Oh, what's this?
Tom's a bum.
We despise her.
He came in front of them.
Here, brother, half.
Tom sent a new fly to the table that he just bought.
Tom will help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's a junkie.
The landscape is excellent.
It's locked.
I found your parents under the bed.
I can't get in there.
We need to test him.
Freedom of expression was strictly restricted.
We'll have to hurry.
Tom celebrated the win with wine.
We haven't got all week.
I'm gonna try and narrow myself down.
Autumn's here.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the car accident?
The water only takes three minutes to rise.
They could fire me for this.
What's the plan?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was very grand.
Dan was about Linda for a very short time.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
I want to take a class.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, and they are endowed with reason and conscience and should treat one another in the spirit of human belonging in general.
What happened was an accident.
This building has a thunderstorm.
They kissed.
I have a friend.
Tom wants to do everything alone.
What's the best part?
I make a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
Soup's overrated.
Why don't you go pick him up?
Tom kept practicing.
Try to understand.
It's not gonna cost you anything to fix it.
Does that mean yes or no?
Tom peeked in the tunnel.
How can you want to be my friend?
Seems familiar.
I'm jealous.
I offered to suck his dick, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
Everything has its limits.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
Bosilok, parsley, rozmarine, team and oregano are popular herbs.
We're lazy.
You're a discerning man.
Everything looked fine.
Leave this here.
He sat on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
I don't get paid much.
I know you like me.
The door's opened.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and your books.
My brother and I shared the room.
I knew you couldn't trust Tom.
I can keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
Well, I'm kind of flattered even.
I'm practicing.
She may have lied to you, but she doesn't have me!
Let's just grab the fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
I'm sick of it.
Tom put his hand in the bag and pulled some coins.
The room was a cupboard.
It's just to solve this problem.
They have to remove the bullet that was stuck to his spine.
It's so funny.
Does Tom seem upset?
If he can, this weekend.
I know how it probably sounds to you.
One of the suitcases is completely empty.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your sunflower.
I don't have a sword.
Suspect confessed.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
You don't seem to know how it hurts to get som.
We're importing grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but there he did it.
Tom's gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to look in the dark.
Tom's busy with his research.
Wipers don't help against ice.
I was pretty.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
Guess he's not coming around to ask Tom.
My brother's coming tomorrow morning.
You don't need to like everything.
Are the potatoes calorie?
They'll get it soon enough.
We made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary over to the bar.
I broke a vase today.
That's what I'm worried about.
I'm gonna go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make makeup for him.
I was waiting for her outside.
You're impressive.
You need to grow up and mature a little.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can I have your name and phone number?
Tom was throwing a rock at me.
Everyone knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so mad about Tom?
Tom will be here for a few days.
I hope we're the last.
They were standing in front of the store to avoid the rain.
I've got a few reasons to remember.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't know Mary had cancer at all.
It was my fault.
They hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't really understand.
Tom was persistent.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why would he be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
They're all out of their minds.
I'm still thinking about her.
Today I learned that there is a movie called "The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!"
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was away from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thank you.
Let's just say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Tom's still not able to write his name?
Tom put the journal in a drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying.
How many more days till Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
I'm not good at it.
Tom's got a collection of grandmas.
She made tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
Do you have enough?
Noisys are plague carriers.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom's gone nuts.
I'm starting tomorrow.
I wasn't being honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write that well.
The King did not foresee the fall of the monarchy.
I'm fucking Tom.
I like baked chestnuts.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep while driving and caused a car accident.
We were hugged.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove that.
It was beautiful.
Tom greets Mary with a wave.
That's okay.
Tom seems worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do it.
How is this camera used?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't mean to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French pretty well.
Make sure you don't overdo it.
Tom's a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with anything?
It's so beautiful.
I don't understand English, I don't understand German.
It'll take about three hours to get off this mountain.
I'm just starving.
They disqualified me.
Are you done packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom's recovering.
Why would Tom do that?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get carried away.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to believe you.
You worry too much about him.
The president has announced that the United States will launch a satellite in orbit.
I can't lend you this book.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I want to be nice.
Tom helped me out a little bit.
Am I too early?
That sounds really cool.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
Do you want to stop?
Watch it, Tom.
Tom tied his ropes.
I can't turn it off.
We shouldn't have stayed up until 2:30.
You're really good at this.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not reasonable.
Women in America had no right to vote.
My neighbor called the fire department.
Tom said I needed to talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did you give him the dog?
Tom's not listening.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Is this what all the excitement was about?
Tom's off somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm rang.
I'm sorry I didn't give you any more support.
Is there any objection?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why they chose him.
That's a pointless fact.
Is it delicious?
Watch out!
We should give Tom a chance to admit it.
The sky is hot.
We don't talk much.
You're a kind man.
Tom got a little snoopy.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer black.
Tom surrendered to his fate.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is similar to Bogotá, and Osaka is similar to Medellin.
Have you stopped beating your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't you stop Tom?
I said I'd bring it in.
Survivors are like mammals.
I'll get started.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm cooking soup in a big pot.
If I get to know Jesus, I'll test his stomach.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell you this if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the wolf going?
He brushed his wet hair with a towel.
If a grown-up kid is lying, he thinks he's always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck!
I might not graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom pulled the screwdriver out of the box with the tools.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom was waving his hands.
Open the notebooks.
You can't let that settle.
Tom opened the screen.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do anything.
Tom went to the next question.
That was thoughtful.
I want a life.
Tom's not in his bed.
It was all my idea.
I don't want riddles.
This book will help you write art.
This area is in the valley.
Do you really want to stay till Monday?
I didn't think you'd be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
Please, blow the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates made fun of her.
Excuse me, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he already saw Mary this morning.
In case I'm makin' my honey toast.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I guess the parrot escaped from the cage.
We went to pick up strawberries.
We live on planet Earth.
I love sunflowers.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get them back.
Tom threw his girlfriend out.
Just give it to Tom.
No one's thrilled.
I almost wouldn't have come.
I was making cake.
Look at the counter.
I was impressed by your design.
You told me to call anytime.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it off.
Tom choked.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hi, how are you?
Last month, I had a bladder infection.
Look at the girls.
I'll take down the kilage.
That's exactly what happened before.
I have my own theory.
I appreciate foreign languages!
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we got married.
How do we benefit from this?
I'm with exactly the one I want to be with.
You invited me to your wedding.
Tom just quit.
Now you can sit down.
But I didn't see anything.
"How are you?" "Okay, thank you!"
Mary was a lovely bride.
Tom should be ashamed.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a quick fight.
The lock's broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want to go?
We haven't done anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might get along.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want spring.
They all have to stay.
We were completely confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has a lot of good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You should eat more.
Tom's not good at sports.
Shouldn't we be helping them?
I didn't feel sorry for them.
Tom felt that he needed a bath.
This message is for them.
When do I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom picked up the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm not even.
The firm fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We're not hanging out.
Where's the mailbox?
The Internet is serious business.
Mars is the red planet.
You waved the dog with a stone.
Tom was staring.
Seven o'clock already.
I'm curious.
We can try.
Demek, you wrote this book yourself!
Don't put so much pepper in the soup.
Let's not be condescending.
They looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog.
Tom was drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need Tom's help.
They were happy.
How can we help?
To prepare the soil for planting, you must plow it.
Tom's not feeling well today.
We're not looking.
Mahmud can't take the money.
Nobody listens to you.
Okay, you convinced me.
I'm ready for him now.
It can't be!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgetfulness and frost usually go in pairs.
Tom didn't know it happened.
I'm at the library.
My pants are broken.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly in.
I agreed.
Tom admitted he spilled the red wine.
Do you want a puppy?
I live near a dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is virtue.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Have you heard of us?
We visited Loara's castles.
Tom's a hopeless case.
It's a little ahead.
I think about him every day.
I'll help with the search for Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I haven't eaten yet.
It would be a pleasure to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your things are here.
Stay as long as you like.
Grab my cancer.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into it.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very cocky at his job.
Come to the house.
Why is music so fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
They're not alone.
I remember you were in Boston for a little while.
How much stomach do you want me to do every day?
Are you gonna cry?
Tom turned to leave.
Tom's kind.
How was the party last night?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate doing this.
Dan's turned into a beggar.
You have very permeable eyes.
Doesn't that make sense?
He seemed tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to town.
We need to let Tom get back to work.
I want you to shoot them all.
I think I'm pretty good at writing.
Are you going back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Do me a favor and get inside.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom seems rich.
Tom's a bit of a mess.
Would you like some water?
Tom's not friendly.
However, the quantity is not true.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to his party.
Squares have four angles.
I kept working.
They've developed addiction.
Would you like me to come with you?
We'll meet you there.
Can you check on those?
Give them a second.
They sat there and kept quiet.
Get the shovel.
You have many different kinds of people here.
Mary went after her mother.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
Nobody listened to Tom.
Do you want me to get something from the supermarket?
It's over.
Tom wiped the blade off his jeans knife.
Tom was trying to stay focused.
Tom's got a long beard.
One of them came to me.
I can arrange for that to happen.
Are your gums bleeding?
Just let her call me, okay?
Tom put his bowl of beer on the bar.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I spoke French.
I've been given a seductive look.
Come on, don't be shy.
I wouldn't want to eat meat from a cloned animal.
How far did you go?
My father is very strict.
Maybe I'd better come back later.
What do the tigers eat?
I'm just gonna buy another one.
Will you come down?
Give him a dollar.
Did you have an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain to me how that's possible.
You looked sharp through the glasses.
Linda convinced Dan he was stalking her.
Why would they mind?
Let's not bother Tom.
This rope is durable.
I just need a break.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do it.
There's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave.
I need to free us.
Why is heaven blue?
Where are Tom's keys?
Did Tom get hurt?
Who could have broken the aquarium?
It came over my head.
Tell me what I'm doing here.
Tom's been struggling with depression for more periods of his life.
You want me to take your bags?
I'd trust my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What do you have to worry about?
I need dinner.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
The class is watching.
There was a penguin's foot on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called the doorknob.
I want to comb my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
You can eat as much as you like.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move over.
I'm not talking fast.
We need to talk in four eyes.
Tom's not thrilled.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep there.
I live in a town near Boston.
I hope the new boss likes you.
Did you mention the results of the test?
If you want quality, pay up.
Tom was starving.
She's studying English.
With such a wild dream, it will become either a famous writer or a madman.
We both hate her.
They're starting to beat her up.
Tom opened the windows in the bedroom.
Don't even talk to me.
We'll survive this.
We came here to apologize.
We will visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom spit the chewing gum out.
Make it mine.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for having me.
Who recommended that?
How did you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to come with us.
I finally beat him.
How Bad Habits Get Here!
She's been acting weird.
Probably won't pay the money back.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how she was born an interest in archaeology.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always get me wrong.
We're just as strong with you.
The president looked strong.
What should I buy?
Tom went to the window and looked outside.
They stole his cell phone.
I'm sad.
I'll be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you played chess better than me.
Is the bridge secure?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people get scared enough, everything can happen.
You're a small town.
He was running as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's neck's been cut off.
Grab the day.
What's Tom ringing?
He's very handsome.
Let the buyer be careful.
Tom's been out of class a lot.
Now it's time for compensation.
Most virgins have read hymen.
You can end it.
Why'd you just fry two sausages?
When I give food to poor people, they call me a saint, and when I ask why poor people don't have food, they call me a Communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom is interested in French history.
Because the bus was held back, we waited a long time in the rain.
You can handle it.
Is that dog there?
I'm getting some rest.
Mary was wearing fake eyelashes.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to get to one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he was speaking French more highly than he really was talking about.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Mary did not understand the lecture.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes are on.
That drug calmed the patient down.
Tom's next crime will be the last.
Please accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look silly.
His mother's American.
Relax a little bit.
Is Tom funny?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The sphinx began to circle around him.
We need your help to find her.
That means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom fusherski did the job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom seemed nervous.
Please tell them what they need to do.
Bacteria are microscopic organisms.
I decide, Tom.
Don't listen to the boss blindly.
I've been looking for him for a while.
Good work.
Tom got sick.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom always liked you.
Now we'll never know.
Should we wait here?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just got dumped.
I prefer goat cheese from a cow.
We understand that.
How is that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
It's been a while since I've eaten dairy.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Everybody having fun?
I've been up all night.
I got unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know you have it.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was a tough one.
The carpenters are cutting wood.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where were you born?
Zini's done.
Single couples should not be able to get married.
The cow forgot it was once a calf.
Give them this picture.
Tom was buried alive.
Sewing is manual work.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm so confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister rip the letter off.
Let me try that.
Could you turn off the cigarette?
What were they laughing at?
Why would I trust her?
Who's the girl sitting there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a cab driver.
There's no sign of Tom yet.
That's when I was home.
Don't push me.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's talk.
The alligator ate the dog.
Lies give birth to other men.
I don't have any more money.
The chair is plastic.
Sunlight is supposedly the best means of disinfection.

Let your conscience bite you now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
The first snow fell today.
Her charm is indescribable.
I'm at work tomorrow.
How much did you bet?
We need it now.

Can I leave a message for her?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at the drawing.

Yeah, I said that, but I wasn't right.
I think we should talk about this right now.
The meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy.
I don't know English, I know Spanish camels.
What are you doing with this?
No one's gonna bother you.
Tom didn't mean that much.
There's wind.
I'm just kidding with you.
I don't know where that is.
We all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
I bought her a wristwatch.
Just sit there.

You're teasing me.
But not in front of the choir.
The company went bankrupt.
I'm 12 years old.
I'm focusing.
Tom's not very talkative.
You were right, guys.
It happens.
There were no others injured.
I decided to take the train.
I'm sure you can handle it.
Are you going to eat at home or outside?
I have three cousins.
If I eat more, I'll get sick.
Are you making fun of me?
I think I know him.
I drink milk.
Don't piss Tom off.
It's a painful task.
You need to make him listen.
I was surprised it was so easy.
I wish Camoli was here.
Tom wasn't hungry.
Tom often calls Mary.
Thank you, dear.

She didn't show up.
I'll admit it.
I'll ask him in your name.
Don't tell my mother.
You can avoid such problems if you have these advice in mind.
His excuse is far from perfect.
I hope we beat Tom.
Get your stuff together.
Where'd you put it?

What do I get out of it?
Don't you think Cookie would be a good name for a dog?
Tom wasn't very busy.
Tom told me he'd be back by the end of the week.
I want a room for a man.
You shouldn't be present for this.
Do you have any idea where Tom might be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin it.
You're very passionate.
My headache's gone.
I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets.
Do you want me to ask him?
Give Tom a bracelet.
The weather here is very unpredictable.
Is she really that pretty?
Hey, don't feel bad.
Isn't that unusual?
I've been sitting on a wall.
The clock's broken.
Tom has to be stopped.
Isn't that excessive?
They know what happened.

Tom's still in bed.
What are you preparing?
This is your house now.
Why don't you try some sushi?
How are you doing?
I feel better.
What's the difference?
I wish I could live my life doing just what I wanted.
It's not my decision.
Despite our expectations, there have been no charges.
The lust is one of the seven deadly sins.
Tom's irresponsible.
I've always wanted to be a teacher.

When's my turn coming?
Tom didn't make it.
I'm a new student.
The baby's asleep.
How rich is Tom?
It's obviously a print error.
It's not often anyone buys a thousand-dollar hat.
Is the police coming?
We have to find him first.
Dan made the assistants laugh with his comments.

Looks like Tom's pretty proud of himself.
No one really knows.
Give me the shovel.
She's here.
He was looking for the key.
This is bad for the environment.
We're chasing her.
Do we have a choice?
I don't know why I reacted like this.
I was on three corners.
I'm here to talk about her.
We have fish for dinner tonight.
I don't eat restaurants very often.
Do we have any food?

We'll deal with it.
The bread is made of flour.
Where's the guy who beat them?
Dan understood this very well.
Do you want a cookie?
Who brought this?
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
Dan may have had a fight with Linda.
There was silence in the room.
Everybody loves him.
Tom was driving like a maniac.
It was a tough test.

Go to Tom's house.

Wonderful!
The palace has a tall tower.
The kids have homework.
Let's go pick them up.

It's very relaxing.
Keep your weapons ready.
We had our reasons.
His reputation was compromised.
I wish I hadn't done that.
Let me help you with that.

Why doesn't anyone want to help us?
The hole's tight.
You should go help him.
Do you enjoy it?
I had a great time tonight.
Tom was in the cabin.
Tom dropped the sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting for you on the porch.
It's nice of him to wear such gifts.
I shamed him.
Shut up or they'll throw you out.

Is Tom safe?
However, there is a solution.
You're unorganized.
I insist.
I'm sure Tom's gonna make it like this.

We can't stay together.
Visitors are welcome.
Can you introduce yourself in a few words?

You'd make a great mother.
Tom kept working.
Please find me a chapter.
Why did they choose them?

You would've done the same thing in my place.
Now, let's continue this conversation in the other room.
I don't hate myself.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Don't talk to me like that!
I smiled.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
Are you going?
I'm happy these days.
I didn't make that mistake again.

It's written on his face.
Thank you for stopping by.
I'm as tall as he is.
Tom couldn't have done it without Mary's help.
So that's Tom there?
Dan spent the night drinking in a meat convulsion.
I'm in.
Do you need a ring?

Don't forget to put cream on the sun.
Was that hard for you?
Tom's voice was barely heard.
Don't be late.
I've decided to forgive him.
How many days does it usually take to get there?
Don't forget these.
When's that coming?
We're gonna have to reschedule.
His depression ended when she kissed him.
We're not even sure Tom's guilty of anything.
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Just sleep over.
Tom's good to me.
No one will find us.
The room was a mess.
Music is just love searching for words.
Sitting around all day is unhealthy.
Tom's gonna wait.
I'm starving you to get down.
The real story is a little different from what you said.
It was your fault.
The balloon was slowly coming down.
Who wants insects?
It's bullshit.
I asked him the same question.
Take three steps and jump.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.

My real name is Tom.
Tom started laughing.
Is that why you're here?
You don't have a preconceived mind, do you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she knew right away that something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm totally naked.
Her gestures to me don't matter.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn't matter that you don't want to do it; either way, you have to.

I'm sure Tom did.
Let me see it.
What's in it?
Did you see anything?
I'm done.
Marry me.
Tom's not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.

No one's getting fired.
There's no one else.

Do we really want to help them?
The one paying the bills has the right to lord it.
You're very lucky.
Yeah, bring me some porridge.
When will you visit us?
Tragedy occurs every day.

He's losing control.
The noise will wake the baby.
I was late for spinach.
Do you know what happened?
Stop talking about me.
Tom was sitting on the sofa with Mary watching TV.
We don't mind.
I think I should have asked for help.

You're going to have to study harder next year.
There are islands in the sea.
There are algae in the sea.
I'm glad I didn't have to do that.

Tom's crazy.
I forgot to tell Tom who's gonna pick him up at the airport.
I'll never work for them.
Tom's not kidding.
Did you touch anything?
Let's do it now and we're done.
Let me talk to Tom.
Your mother put your collage in the top drawer.
You've been in a car accident, but you'll be fine.
Think what you want.
Where can I find a hospital?
Don't even ruin the party.

I don't know why you don't like it.
No, that's not what I meant!
Tom wanted me to stay.
I can't remember buying this.
He saved the sailor.
Tom was obviously here earlier this morning.
Get up, you lazy bastard!
How long ago was it?
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I want to marry her.
Tom has another plan.
This couch is very comfortable.
If I were you, I'd have avoided Tom for a while.
I won't wait to find out.
Let's continue this conversation outside.
It's easy to recognize Tom because he's very tall.
The doctor examined Tom to determine that there were no internal injuries.

How are you holding up?
Tom didn't know this.
I want to fuck her.
I can come back tomorrow.
When did you get up?
I'm in love with you.
Tom's in his bedroom talking on the phone.
It's been tough on us.

I'm guilty.
The dog's supposed to be on the line.
I'd rather go alone.
It was one of them.
I want to lie down and get some rest.
Tom's in the hospital and he's recovering from an overdose.
He broke the nuts with his teeth.
I can't believe we were getting ready to shoot Tom.
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
She didn't hit him. She hit me.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I let Tom catch me.
Tom's already here.
They look busy today.
I'm sure Tom's never been to Boston.
I think I should check on Tom.
Just do your best.
Tom's a face.
When you go out with a girl, you have to be confident.
Tom, please, this isn't even the right time or the right place.
We put her under surveillance.
Tom's untrustworthy.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the hat off the toilet.
That's good training.
This capital is peculiar.
I should have turned it down.
I had to consider what might happen.
That was my tactics.
I've lived here for years.
Are you still in bed?
It was for her.
I've got to buy flowers for my leech.
I know you did your best.
Tom shouldn't have written his password on the inside of the cover of the notebook.
When did you move to Boston?
I just need to find them.
I know both of them.
I should be sorry about them.
I don't appreciate it.
Is there a problem?
Knock on the door.
We were so worried.
I'm not commenting on the articles.
You'll be my guests.
Watching TV is fun.
What can you expect?
I want you to come to Boston.
This is really hot.
I want to live in Brazil.
Make an appointment.
I'm in love with Tom's girlfriend.
Take care of Tom.
It's just words.
There was a short silence.
Tom closed the trunk.
We met in Boston last year.
Tom swears too much.
No one walks to Los Angeles.
I'm not a whore.
He was in a hurry to catch the bus.
I didn't mind.
Look what Tom got.
I don't want to cook.
Tom was adorable.
I agree with the plans.
Justice is expressed through deeds.
I don't know if you know or not, but you're supposed to tip the waiter here in America.
Such behavior was childish on his part.
I'm hanging out with her.
That would be fine.
Sorry about yesterday.
Leave while you still can.
Tom was a little uncomfortable around Mary.
I don't need those.
Did Tom give you that?
The cars have replaced the wagons.

There's nothing else I can look for.

He can't do that.
Why worry about them?
I called him from the hospital.
I opened my umbrella.
Tom doesn't have manners.
Pray for her.
Can you hold on a second?
It's not over yet.
Look at her as a gang member in the square.
Didn't anyone tell you you don't have to be here today?
I was so pleased.
I can feel it in your touch.
It fell off a tree.
Tom told Maria he never met John.
Did you get all that?
You better go help him.
Tell me if you get a boyfriend.
It was amazing.
Why does everyone hate him?
I can barely see him.
I'm coming.
I was in the middle of the night.
Do not expect everyone to have the same opinion.
I appreciate the good things and the books.
This is much worse.
I'm afraid Tom's gonna get caught.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
Something's stuck in my head.
Don't you ever suspect anything?
I was staring at the man.
Watch out for Tom.
They look familiar.
We have work to do.
All my dreams will come true.
The river passes through the valley.
Get in touch with her.
Tom wants the best.
The human mind is magnificent.
There's no poison in this fish.
I want you to be with me.
I want to play golf.
Tom was deeply interested in the history of art.
They can't afford it.
I'm going to college.
Tom didn't see it.
Did you get some sleep?
It's probably still available.
Looks like we're gonna have a snowy Christmas this year.
You met my sister, right?
I hope we find her.
Tom's new in town, and he needs a job.
I was surprised when Tom said he was unhappy here.
Tom works in a closed room.
He had a great concert.
There's no answer.
Tom told me he wanted me to buy him a picture.
This is really easy.
Are you going on foot?
You should try it.
You're worried enough.
I don't think Tom's gonna be much help.
Tom seems worried.
I care about him.
Tom's amazing.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
Tom's getting closer.
Tom seems shocked.
Are you leaving Boston?
Tom's compassionate.
Make it short, Tom.
Tom called to ask if there was any way he could help.
We could've handled it.
This isn't anybody's fault.
I don't like the taste of onions.
You can't sit there.
I want to know why you're going to be late.
Tom ran to the bathroom.
Let's go to lunch.
It's warmer today than yesterday.
It must have been created somewhere.
The weekend was fully equipped, with a pool, barbecue, a soccer playground and a pool table.
Tom claims he wants to learn French.
We're all pawns.
I'll see you again.
We were so young back then.
I hear you asked about me.
While eating pizza, he teased his sister.
We should've given up earlier.
That's close enough.
Tom's polite.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My work so far has been lost.
"Why are you doing this?" "I can do it."
What a pig you are.
Lock the gate.
Tom let the heat go.
We're all the same.
I want to be there for you.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that terrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You may come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
This sounds totally acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polar contradictions: one was sincere and trustworthy and the other was unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I'm not going down.
What were you and Tom doing yesterday?
I won't forget.
She turned off the computer.
She bought it in a butcher shop.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why would I trust them?
I'm from Beijing.
There are only two species in Ireland.
One by one, the boys came to see what I was reading.
Who are you living with?
So, what do I tell him?
Where's your kid?
Tom's on the bed and he's on the phone.
These are wonderful.
Tom's hands are busy.
Tom was thrilled.
I'm eating pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're lucky.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
Where did Tom work?
I need to deliver them.
The noise upset the whole town.
A person who wants flowers can't be a bad person.
This isn't a joke.
They flashed.
You're mean.
Did you give Tom that note?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You have small breasts.
I believe Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you texting Mary?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Tom was babbling.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She always wears assault clothes.
Tom was the boss.
That's ugly.
There may be discussions about it.
Women don't like you.
Time to get up.
This isn't your problem, this is mine.
Before I went to bed, I had three cold pills.
Maybe Tom's wrong.
They might need help.
I don't have vodka.
Tom's acting like a spoiled brothel.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me for?
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
They're very good.
Do you like movies?
Time is forever.
First of all, you have no right to draw conclusions, secondly, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who would blame him?
In the audience, I think it's boring.
I grow goods.
She borrowed the liner.
I'll see you.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.
My mother had to lend me her keys.
Tom's got the hills.
There was a war going on.
Was Tom involved?
The thief turned into a cop.
We'll let Tom try.
That would make sense.
I'll wash my hands.
Pick one.
Tom is angry and scared.
You're mean and repulsive.
I wish I could help you more.
Tom is no longer visible.
I think we're done.
Tom saw Mary sitting in the park by herself.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They completely renovated the building's facade, and when I walked by her car, I didn't recognize her.
Is it possible that this is all there is?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has to stop.
It's fair.
I know you're busy.
All the kids were sitting in a circle on the floor.
Tom forgot.
Ask him to join us.
It will not be easy to do so without much help.
Tom knows Boston well.
This time we won.
Tom works in a restaurant nearby.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
They gave me a sedative.
This has nothing to do with the subject.
I'll be back in a little while.
She seemed to be deeply shaken by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we are not careful, so will we.
Here I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need some help.
I thought Tom came from Boston.
This is a very difficult test.
I'm getting a divorce.
That dinner.
My jar's leaking.
You'll get wrinkles.
Tom's a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes broke.
The geyser throws out cold boiling water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You're not suggesting we give Tom all the money, are you?
Tom kept packing.
I don't have a home I can go back to.
I'm here on my own initiative.
It's to protect you.
Someone's always helped me.
They don't want that.
Tom's taking over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He's very shy, he says he wants to see you.
You were right, Tom.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get any of them?
Can you connect with him?
Tom said if he won the lottery, he'd buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I'm not good at math.
Defend yourself!
Above all, be kind to older ones.
Precious stones include the aquamarine, the amethyst, the emerald, the quartz, and the ruby.
Go find them.
You've got to ask your mother for permission first.
I'll take Tom's place.
What did you think of coming to Boston?
You're our guests.
Tom insulted Mary.
I know I packed it.
You're squeezing the chickens a lot.
It was a beautiful day.
I made him take a picture of me.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them for a while.
It was a quick wave.
Tom remembered a variety of things that no one else remembered.
Easy to tell.
I'm gonna go look for her.
Of all the languages I've taught, my French was the easiest.
Tom wrote homework.
I count to 200.
Watch this.
Shall I go?
Boy looks like a monkey.
Butterflies are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a shame?
How much did you do?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did he want?
We got a fried goose with potatoes.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did you take the money on the loan?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston's beautiful.
This project is not going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
Give yourself an idea.
Can I get a tattoo?
They were all so busy.
I lied to both of you.
I'm gonna lose everything.
I need food.
Tom showed up at Mary's.
We don't drink enough water.
I have homework.
He was breathing deep.
That's terrible.
I'm not good enough for her.
That woman is easily embarrassed.
Is everything there with a car?
I think I might be able to help her.
I'll do what's right for me.
Tom's got plenty of time.
I'll be fine.
I hit something weird.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
Tom has always been poor.
It's a beautiful alkaline.
Go see if Tom's in the office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom was yelling at Mary.
Was he home alone?
He forced a large amount of money out of her.
Can you help me figure this out?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only desire was for her to return to see her only daughter for the last time.
She's the woman I want.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do it alone?
I'm gonna go find someone else.
I'm starving.
I bought a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Spiders make spider webs.
You really talk a lot.
It could be too late.
I couldn't find them anywhere.
It's a special occasion.
Tom shouldn't always believe what others say.
He's head to heel in love.
Don't buy me anything.
Tom's oldest daughter is not married.
Knowledge is the ultimate goal.
Tom's funny.
In my opinion, Tom is innocent.
Tom's in pain.
Who's driving?
Tom won't be able to help you.
Let's just get to work.
You're in trouble!
I think that's the only possible conclusion.
People sometimes ask me what I'll do when I retire.
Tom recognized Mary's handwriting.
I think you've helped enough.
It must have been her.
Where are we going to eat?
Tom can do anything.
The sound soon stopped.
Who threw you away?
I don't really get it myself.
Tom's a good dancer.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
It's a police vehicle.
He knows the secret.
Tom was in bed.
He knows how to plant palm trees.
How do you know about him?
Just keep walking.
Tom's a good friend, isn't he?
Say you understand me.
Tom was so tired that he fell asleep without eating dinner.
How's Tom gonna get in?
There's someone on the threshold.
Tom wasn't picking up.
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
Let's try calling her.
It was a great day.
It was a lovely evening.
I think I might sneeze.
Go ahead.
Peter may need a new diaper.
How's Tom doing at work?
I don't want him to know where I live.
Tom doesn't talk to me about anything anymore.
I can't just give up.
Tom wants to swim.
I'll scream.
I'm not your errand boy.
What's our status?
Do you want me to watch him?
You're a real human being.
Boston is a beautiful place.
Who's responsible?
I'm serious.
I think it's better if we don't drink water.
No one's talking.
What do you think you're gonna do, contact them?
Nothing can be done.
Do you have anything?
It's not cold.
Will you do the same?
There were witnesses.
I don't know why it's so hard to believe.
I don't want to be treated differently from before.
They should be fine.
I followed the rules.
Tom's a widower.
I think Tom's heartless.
I haven't seen that movie yet.
You already did.
You're poor.
Give me another nail.
Many Russians were killed painting themselves with their phones.
He thinks that the old newspapers are still useful.
I want to be invited.
We see who's laughing, but not who's crying.
How old are you, Tom?
He was wearing a red bracelet around his neck.
The girl didn't say anything.
It was getting darker.
There's one thing I don't understand.
You've been having a lot of fun listening to music.
Try the shirt.
I'll tell Tom you're here.
Tom didn't accept Mary's invitation.
I can barely work right now.
When did Tom say his party was gonna start?
This was obviously a difficult decision Tom made.
Maybe Tom would be happy with Mary.
Dan was doing his job very well.
My legs still hurt.
I would do anything to help him.
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I fainted.
It's hard to assess his ability.
That's good.
I know a man sitting over there on the other side.
I just had a vision.
You can't treat me like this.
I'm open to anything.
I used to hear you.
Stand where they are.
Are you her cheater?
"She likes music, don't she?" "Yes, she does."
The Berber sews it up.
That's very interesting.
We still want to help.
I'm gonna get lost.
The sister injected her with the flu.
Have you tried talking to Tom?
That sounds pretty stupid.
Tom didn't stay here long.
Tom liked the idea.
Tom started chasing Mary around the playground.
I don't have a name.
Why don't I ever win?
Tom fell off a cliff cleaning his hatchlings.
Do you have anything to add, Tom?
Quiet, fool!
Sometimes I can't help it.
Damascus is in Syria.
All the compositions were good except yours.
I don't think Tom's gonna be at school tomorrow.
Please, this way.
We'll wait patiently.
Tom's a little pale.
Next year, my birthday will fall on Sunday.
Everyone laughed.
Did Tom look happy?
Who wrote these messages?
Tom's making push-ups.
Tom was breathing deeply.
Tom has two choices.
Have you ever been to this cave?
Dan didn't want to go to an orphanage again.
We can start tonight.
He's a liar.
Tom's waiting outside.
It's nice to feel needed by someone.
You'll never know.
I'm still thinking about him.
I thought it was happening to me.
Tom seems lonely.
Shall we try again?
No one's here.
How much money does Tom owe you?
Are you vegetarian?
I can't find my pen.
Tom won't know how to use it if you don't show him.
You bought Mary something.
Nothing looks more like a drunk freak.
Take Tom.
Tom's getting undressed.
I know Tom times.
It looks nice.
We stopped at Boston.
This almost works.
I can't concentrate on all this noise.
Give me the cards, Tom.
The robbers tied his mouth.
Smile at him.
This cure will relieve the pain.
I'd like to buy you dinner.
Can't it wait?
They'll pay for their excesses.
Dan hasn't missed a single episode of that soap.
I love butterflies.
Nothing will change my love for you.
I asked them to sign the papers.
We have a few questions for you, Tom.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I hate her just as much as you do.
We can get you help.
I heard him.
We're investigating the entire area.
Don't forget Tom still loves you.
Tom told me I'd like to come see him tomorrow afternoon.
I'm gonna miss everybody.
Here we are.
Why do they do that?
I've been in college for four years, and I've missed nothing but a poor diploma.
This is priceless.
Do you want to draw?
It was pretty gross.
Tom's listening.
I don't plan on staying here that long.
We're back together.
After the fire, there was only ash left.
Tom wants all kinds of vegetables except cabbage.
Try putting yourself in his skin.
Tom used to write poems.
We'll take Tom home.
Tom needs to know about this.
I'm ready to make up for it.
People can't make miracles.
That's a little rough.
They decided to shut him out of their company.
Those who interfere with the verb endings are coming and a special place in hell awaits them.
What happened after that?
Do you know what's going on?
Can you deliver that?
Why do I have to go?
Looks like they're all over the place.
I didn't count on that.
I was a mess.
I saw Tom last week.
This shouldn't take long.
I'm trying not to worry.
Tom's got to clean up.
We're very angry.
Tom's not that old.
Everybody can drive.
Tom made two pipes.
He was in the hospital for a week.
I didn't give her anything.
Tom didn't make a good first impression.
Please, sit inside.
That's not my signature.
I've decided to contribute exclusively to Spanish sentences this month.
That was terrible.
We're glad you're here.
You've earned something.
It really sucks.
Do you want some cheese?
They say blue tomatoes contain a lot of nicotine.
I guess I'm feeling a little tired.
She gave him all her silver.
Do you speak French?

I'm done.
Do you need any help with this?
Tom, your patent is open.
We have a warrant to arrest you.
Tom doesn't go shopping.
I came to bring him a present.
I asked her to describe it.
I just took a shower.
I didn't do it alone.
What is she?

I have a great idea.
I got something for him.
How do I know if Tom's the right guy for me?
Tom is studying agriculture.
I hit Tom.
Didn't you fix the pump?
Isn't that a beautiful sound?

How can you be sure?
We have to give them something.
It's not up to you.
The students are gone.
You've done so much.
Kate is very charming.
Where are you going?
Your path is difficult.
You're gonna have to sit still.
Tom took his flute and started playing.
Tom wants to be rich.
That's perfect.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
Fix this mess.
Blood flows through the blood vessels.
You're borrowing books.
I can barely move.
Tom was wondering how good a singer Mary was.
Look at my fingers.
You took my place.
Tom's bad.
My interest in politics is purely academic.
I'm not musical, but I'm singing in the shower.
You're lying to me.
They're playing volleyball.
When did you buy that from them?
Let's eat.

Tom, don't pretend to be Tosho.
Call the number I gave you.
I'll check on you later.
Is there food?
I'll cooperate.
I bought him something.
I'd say no.

It was hot yesterday, but it's more resilient today.
I'm cold.
He walked right in front of me.
Give it back to me.
Is he breathing?
Tom left Boston yesterday.
This isn't fair to me.
It's possible someone was following them.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston next Monday.
That's so boring.
The kid kept all his money in a cash register.
I wish I'd met her.
They smiled.
I'd like to talk to him.
This is a leather belt.

Turn off the light.
Do you want me to come to you?
I'm going to Boston next week.
Would you like some more bread?
This isn't gonna work.
He's just gone.
The children were so excited after the party that they couldn't sleep.

It wasn't very good.

Tom was soon lost in the crowd.
For the record, I don't care at all.
No, I'm still a mess.
This is hard for me.
Now how do you feel about her?
Don't surprise me.
That made me wonder.
This is the thing we discussed the other day.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a deadly sexually transmitted disease.
That's not surprising.
Turn around the corner.
She betrayed me.
Why are you leaving when we kiss?
Someone will see us.
I'll give him another chance.
Tom finally smiled.

I'm glad about that.
It's like I messed up.
We have to wait here.
Is everything okay with you?
Does that sound familiar to you?
How much do you want?
Tom's losing blood.
I have to stay here.
Anything or nothing.
This information is confidential.
I came for them.
My life has changed.
No one's talking about them.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
You and I are flying the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom's not listening.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does it start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at an auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
One hour before the event.
You were amazing.
I'm not giving up until I figure out who was responsible.
The alarm rang.
The bird lifted the branch with the beak and flew to its nest.
Tom wanted to leave.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
Tom's not the same man from three years ago.
Everyone smiled at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it on his own.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I gotta go see Tom.
Tom's unusually calm.
I'm gonna ask Tom to take some time for you tomorrow morning.
What the hell did you buy?
Tom was trying to free himself.
What am I gonna be?
Tom didn't tell Mary anything.
It's not the right time.
I'll be home by noon.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep at once.
It lasted a lot longer than I thought it would last.
Tom ran by Mary.
I've been scratched by a cat.
Tom's not an old man.
The question is how Tom did it.
I swear it was them.
Did you have a bathing suit?
His nose is the best of distinctions.
I can't ask them now.
Tom's got the woolen hair.
Long live the USSR!
It's so cool.
I want to buy pineapple.
I was home yesterday.
It's my only hope.
Don't come for me.
It's just a question.
The bush is on fire.
Tom was affected.
I'm having a bad conscience.
How did you know Tom was gonna lie to me?
Every country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
Frogs are wonderful creatures.
There are three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom's drunk with tequila.
In other words, she's a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You've been snooping around a lot.
We want more money.
Don't lose it.
Do you agree with your parents?
Tom's doing something.
You should have asked her first.
Tom's got a scar on his cheek.
Don't you believe us?
I give you my respect.
Be merciful.
Let's follow the others.
Before I fall asleep, I hear music.
I'll pray for them.
Those benches are mine.
Did you have a nice trip?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You need to create a habit of brushing your teeth after each meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom's picking up the heart.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed outside.
This is the king's trusted adviser.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change.
Tom was really mad.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where'd you get that?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom is very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else do I get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you could possibly imagine.
No one's gonna get hurt.
Tom gave Mary a hand watch.
I'm sure Tom added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice Mary wasn't at the party.
He changed the job.
It's too late to help you.
We tried to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom kept climbing.
Tom might be able to light your car.
Did you hear that too?
What did they find?
You lied to my eyes.
I'm gonna go find her.
I wanted to wash up.
They're listening.
I didn't realize Tom did it.
If I ignore him, he'll leave.
We'd just be in the way of Tom.
Maybe I should help her.
Don't touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I learned him by heart.
I have nothing to give you.
They found an isolated beach, so they spent the day there.
Nothing's changed.
They were all on alert.
He's a little out of tune, so talk louder.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
It's up to you.
That's a very controversial explanation.
The walk before breakfast is refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read it.
We'll make it work.
It is too risky to fight them in a place of their choice.
Wasn't that terrible?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his harsh attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
He was framed for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We're all eager to see the movie.
It's simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom was wearing his one-pack shirt.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, shall we?
That dinner was really good!
Control yourself.
Multiplying is commutative, and sharing is not.
I'm joking.
Tom took off his hat and bowed down.
We're running out of butter.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
Whose handwriting is this?
Did you see what it says in today's newspapers?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks three to six coffees a day.
Tom shook up loudly.
It was Butter.
Tom started snoring.
I'm gonna ask you to stay for a while.
We hear two goats.
I see Tom every day.
Everyone pointed to her.
Maybe Tom's gonna die in the morning.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll get there in time.
Tom was crazy.
This cape is empty.
There's grapes in the fridge.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend to be hearing about Tom for the first time?
Tom, relax your hand.
Einstein viewed himself as a philosopher.
The steam clouded my glasses.
So, no.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We all cheered for her.
Didn't you see the Christmas flag?
Settle down!
I told you it would be hard to get out.
I think I found one of those.
You'll try, won't you?
Tom's been hanging out without food all week.
I don't understand you.
Although I'm a devout man, I'm still a man.
Tom apologized for being late.
Are there any problems I need to know about?
Tom needs to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't be so angry.
A lot of people hunt.
He deserves the reward.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Where are we headed?
Tom basically does what Mary does.
There's something we need to examine.
Tom opened his eyes.
They can't get out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How are your breasts?
Tom was drinking in silence.
I'm hit!
Who said anything?
Tom started saying something, but Mary shut him up.
We met in a menu.
What was Tom's attitude?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
I had nothing to drink.
I turned the whole town around looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Nightlife is better in New York.
Please come in.
Lek must be taken on an empty stomach.
Tom's not a member.
I guess it's our job not to let that happen.
Why is the universe black?
My blood's down.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was cursed.
I baked you a perpetual bread.
Pigs from marzipan don't gnaw.
Tom regained consciousness.
Tom pissed Mary off.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom's good for it.
Tom might be here today.
Tom doesn't distinguish between reality and fantasy.
Tom's a hero.
Tom has no power of will.
Will you help me?
Don't pass out on me.
Tom wasn't home when I left.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Let's do it one more time.
You'd better die on your feet than live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I've been home all night.
We snuck out of there at 11 o'clock.
You can ask me anything you want.
You used to love Boston so much.
We don't have that kind of money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
He found someone to talk to, you only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human, because it is of another dimension.
I'm bored.
What's the weather?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don't think they've invented a cure for that yet.
Every member must attend.
You didn't get her joke.
This is the uglyest snow I've ever seen.
He's hoping to go abroad.
Tom is obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would Tom want to die?
Did you get his name?
It doesn't seem to help.
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
Where's my golf equipment bag?
Read these instructions.
We're not criminals.
The flour is made of wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom didn't agree with Mary on that.
You're right.
I'll go.
It's my 16th birthday.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'm going to Tom's.
Did Tom buy presents?
You two are so cute together.
You're beautiful.
Tom and Mary had fun together.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
What's happiness?
Dan hurt Linda's dog.
You wasted your key bone while you were playing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
The show's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom's blind.
Do you really believe this guy's a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was in the mood.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecy was fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something wonderful happened.
Tom adheres to a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please let them know.
I have to call her.
He asked me if I had anything to cook for.
Watch the road.
We'll stop on the way.
I heard Tom like a hill.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't waste my nerve on that.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
So you didn't know how to play the piano?
It's closing time.
Leave him to me.
The rock was rolling down the hill.
She went to a hairdresser.
Tom's totally crazy.
Come on again!
It doesn't cost his heart.
You don't have to comment.
Chicken's raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
That time, Tom was swimming.
This penguin is so cute.
You're such a nerd.
We're sorry, but we don't accept credit cards.
It was all right here.
They look a little miraged.
I could make it easier for you.
Put the phone down.
I'd never get out of my dad's house.
I think Tom's a cepidan.
The disease of a terrible infection and the ovary leaked.
I don't need advice.
This isn't worth it.
It's not coming in.
Tom headed for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He's been acting weird sometimes.
We'd hang them.
Now's probably not a good time for this.
I'll be back in a minute.
I have a list of her.
That was so stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things I should be doing.
Believe in justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we just take everything?
Who took the money?
I'm not incompetent.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're influential.
I got a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we bake a pastry cake?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the most intelligent.
I had to protect Tom.
This is really relaxing.
Call him right now.
Hold on to the subject.
She really wants to talk.
I have a ton of questions.
This is an interesting, funny and even a startling story.
I'll call Tom later.
Each language sees different things in the world.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put your pajamas on.
This way.
This is a sacred land.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday's in July.
We got everything.
What's one beer?
Tom said he can't play tennis.
Where'd you find it, live everything?
This was at the top of the pile.
I'm done with it.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's a godless man.
Tom hasn't spoken to me since we got laid.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found someone else.
I don't know whether to sit or run.
Don't you think it's pretty hot for December?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Are you crashing into it?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm calling.
I lost track of time.
This island is an American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I baked cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people are in this room?
I've already thought about it.
I'd do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You've sewn your ankle.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was a little hungover.
