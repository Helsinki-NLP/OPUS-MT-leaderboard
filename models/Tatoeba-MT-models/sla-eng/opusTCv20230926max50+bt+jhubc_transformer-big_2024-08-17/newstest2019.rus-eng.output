Named the number of new recruits preparing to be sent to the Donbass from Ukraine
The official representative of the People’s Militia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) Andrey Marochko said that in the winter of 2018-2019, Ukraine will send at least 3 thousand recruits to the Donbass.
According to him, in this way Kiev plans "at least somehow to complete the units."
"The reluctance of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, mass dismissals have led to low staffing of units," Marochko said, quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the real numbers of Ukrainians drafted into the army can be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by a joint forces operation (JFO).
It was assumed that this measure will lead to the strengthening of the role of Ukrainian security forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in the Donbass worsened due to the murder of the head of the DPR Alexander Zakharchenko.
The DPR authorities classified the incident as a terrorist attack.
During the investigation of the criminal case, several people involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the sabotage was organized by the Ukrainian special services.

On September 28, it became known that the US Securities and Exchange Commission accused Musk of misleading shareholders with a statement about the availability of sufficient funds to buy back shares of this company and filed a lawsuit against the entrepreneur.
This is about the publication of the businessman on Twitter, where he announced his desire to buy back Tesla shares for $ 420 per share, but he never did it.

The head of the British Foreign Ministry compared the EU with the Soviet Union and prison
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of capturing member states of the community.
The diplomat made such a statement at the congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
As noted by the Daily Mail, thus Hunt commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to the belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from a community into a prison, the desire to leave it will not decrease, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who will want to escape from captivity," the minister said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for the decision to leave the European Union will only exacerbate the crisis.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May said that Brexit negotiations had reached a deadlock.
She commented on the results of the informal summit of the European Union in Salzburg.
The decision on Brexit was made in 2016 following a referendum.
The United Kingdom’s withdrawal is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
The Irish border remains open.

Telegram users complained about the failure of the new version
iPhone users complained about problems with the Telegram messenger after the update, which was released on September 28.
The phone number of the user can be found by his username
Complaints relate to gadgets with the current operating system iOS 12.
According to their owners, after the update, the application shows a white screen or closes immediately.
Representatives of the messenger reacted to the failure.
According to them, the problem may be related to the migration of information to a new application written in the Swift language.
In Telegram, the automatic update of the application was temporarily suspended before troubleshooting.
On April 13, the Tagansky court of Moscow granted Roskomnadzor’s claim to block the Telegram messenger in Russia.
Three days later, the operators began to implement the decision.
The reason was the refusal of the messenger administration to provide the FSB with the keys to decrypt the correspondence necessary to obtain data on terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed its privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of a suspected terrorist user when a court decision was obtained.
The audience of Telegram after blocking in Russia decreased by 1.2 million

Elon Musk is forced to leave the post of Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tesla
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Elon Musk have settled their dispute over the fraud case.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the TV channel, as part of the agreements, Musk will have to leave the post of the head of the board of directors of Tesla.
At the same time, the commission allowed Musk to retain the post of Tesla's head.
As noted, the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $ 20 million.
The same amount will be charged to Tesla.
The money will be distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Elon Musk is an American entrepreneur, included in the list of the 50 richest people on the planet according to Forbes magazine.
He is the head of the SpaceX space corporation, neurotech company Neuralink and the developer of Tesla electric cars, as well as the co-founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier sued Tesla CEO Elon Musk over his tweet about a possible buyout of the company.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy back all shares on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The price of the share of $ 420 was established allegedly "because of the importance of this number in the culture of marijuana," Bloomberg reported earlier, citing the co-director of the security department of the Commission Stephen Peikin.
At the same time, Elon Musk subsequently abandoned his plans to buy shares.
Commenting on the lawsuit filed against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman said that he considers the accusations of fraud unfounded, and added that he is very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
“Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I didn’t break it in any way,” he told CNBC.
In August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a class action lawsuit against Musk, complaining of financial losses.
The plaintiffs claimed that the posts of the businessman brought them losses.
In particular, one of the shareholders said that the businessman’s tweets were misleading, which caused Tesla stock sellers to be forced to buy securities at artificially inflated prices to cover their positions.
Also, other plaintiffs noted that the careless statements of Elon Musk led to sharp fluctuations in the course.
In September, Elon Musk accused the head of the research company Citron Research of exchange fraud.
Meanwhile, if Musk could not settle his dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, he would face suspension from the company and even prison.
This, in particular, told CNBC channel former chairman of the Commission Harvey Pitt.
Musk is “a good guy who doesn’t know how to run a car company.”

In the ROC compared the possible renaming of the UOC with the actions of the fascists
The head of the Department of External Church Relations (DEC) of the Moscow Patriarchate, Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk, compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists in Germany.
Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk - on the causes of the conflict with the Patriarchate of Constantinople, a possible church schism and its political subtext
According to him, now that “the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is in an acute stage”, renaming the church is like in fascist Germany “to put a yellow six-pointed star on the Jews”.
"This means labeling the church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created," the representative of the Russian Orthodox Church said on the Rossiya 24 TV channel.
The Metropolitan also stressed that the UOC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian one, because “the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country.”
UOC calls on exarchs of Constantinople to leave its territory
Grand Prix in Sochi: sold-out, Russian car and the return of Kvyat
Over the next ten years, Russia may have its own racing car.
This was stated by Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak, summing up the meeting with Russian automakers on the eve of the start of the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi.
Also, the Deputy Prime Minister shared his opinion on the return of Daniil Kvyat to Toro Rosso and assessed the attendance of the Russian stage of Formula 1.
The result of our meeting with automakers should be the creation of the Russian Formula 1 car in the foreseeable future, which has no analogues in the world, ”said Dmitry Kozak.
We need to encourage our automakers in this direction.
It was about plans until 2024, but I do not think that at such a time it is possible.
I think a more realistic timeframe is in the next ten years.”
From 2012 to 2014 in Formula 1 under the Russian license was the team "Marusya".
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there are already investors who are ready to invest in the creation of a domestic team in the Formula 1 World Championship.
I know that in Russia there are fans of motor sport, wealthy businessmen who are ready to invest, ready to invest in the creation of the Russian Formula 1 team.
“We are ready to support them morally.
Let’s hope we have a team like that.
I suspect that the idea of creating a team appeared, among other things, because such an infrastructure appeared in Sochi.
Tomorrow, Sochi Autodrom will be sold out.
According to Dmitry Kozak, the organizers managed to sell all 50 thousand tickets.
Look, even the qualifications of the rostrum were almost full, - said the Deputy Prime Minister.
I can say that revenue this year increased by 72% compared to last year.
This is a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the efficiency of the use of Sochi Autodrom infrastructure throughout the year.
This will be an additional tourist product, which will give even more attractiveness to Sochi.
Dmitry Kozak did not miss the main topic of the day for Russian motorsport fans - the return of Daniil Kvyat to Toro Rosso.
We all congratulate Daniil and wish him success next season, - said Deputy Prime Minister "Izvestia".
He is a very hopeful driver.
Next year, for the first time in history, two main Russian pilots will be able to take part in the Formula 1 peloton.
Although the future fate of Sergei Sirotkin in the "Royal races" is still unknown.
His contract with Williams ends at the end of the season, and the results are not yet impressive: he took 18th place in the qualification of the Russian Grand Prix.
Hopefully, next season our main drivers will be more than this year, - said Dmitry Kozak.

Penicillin was also discovered by accident.
Fleming’s name was included in the list of the 100 most outstanding personalities in the history of mankind.
His discovery, according to many scientists, changed the course of history.
With the help of penicillin, medicine began to cope with most of the most ancient diseases, previously considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene ...
When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, Fleming came to the French capital in 1945, the Parisian newspapers wrote: "To defeat fascism and liberate France, he did more than dozens of divisions."
According to experts, Fleming’s discovery of the world’s first antibiotic saved the lives of more than 200 million people.
Alexander Fleming died at his home in London in 1955 of a heart attack.
He was cremated, and a week later his ashes were buried in the famous London Cathedral of St. Paul.
Where, by the way, my wife and I drew attention to it by a chatty Russian-speaking guide.
And a few years later, the statue of Alexander Fleming in full growth we had the opportunity to see in the most unexpected place for this in the capital of Spain.
There, near the main arena for the bullfight Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas, the famous Spanish matadors erected a monument to a man, whose efforts were saved, in their opinion, the lives of hundreds of outstanding bullfighters.
By the way, this, in my opinion, very interesting porcelain work was found by me there, in Madrid, but at another time and not at all about this.

Hollywood star Gwyneth Paltrow ("Iron Man", "Shakespeare in Love") married producer Brad Falchak.
Although rumors of their wedding went back in April, the couple officially concluded only now - September 29.
According to People magazine, a private ceremony was held at Paltrow's home on Long Island.

Google will pay $9 billion to remain the default search engine in the Apple Safari browser.
According to Business Insider, next year payments will grow to $ 12 billion.
Last year, Google paid $3 billion for this option.

Trump spoke about “falling in love” with Kim Jong-un
From mutual cruelty, the leaders of the United States and North Korea have almost reached the point of falling in love with each other, Donald Trump joked.
US President Donald Trump made a good joke about his successes on the frontline of resolving the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, now the leaders of the two countries have corrected relations so much that they almost fell in love with each other, the American president noted.
The owner of the White House recalled that he accepted from the previous administration the North Korean problem as the main difficulty in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama’s team had so launched relations with the DPRK that they could not even reach the country’s leadership – they simply did not take the phone off.
Then the United States and North Korea were on the verge of war, and today the North Korean leader writes to the White House “beautiful letters”, said trump.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work, too, “was cruel” to Kim Jong-un, which, however, was mutual.
However, now their relationship has improved so much that the leaders "fell in love with each other."
At the same time, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media interpret them as incompetence.
Trump drew attention to the fact that Pyongyang has recently stopped nuclear and missile tests, and also closes military training grounds.
All this is the merit of the work of his administration, the American president is sure.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump spoke flatteringly about Kim Jong-un from the rostrum of the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for his courage and steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
At the same time, Trump noted that sanctions against the DPRK will remain until the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
Category: Talks in Singapore
June 12 in Singapore held the first ever talks between the leaders of the United States and North Korea.
After a serious aggravation of relations and mutual threats of the use of nuclear weapons, the summit looked like a turning point in the protracted US-Korean crisis.
As a result of the talks, the parties expressed their intention to move towards a peaceful resolution of the contradictions, although they did not assume any legal obligations.
Positive results of the meeting were the termination of nuclear and missile tests of the DPRK, as well as the return to the United States of the remains of American soldiers who were in the country.
At the same time, other practical steps towards the denuclearization of North Korea are still stalling.
The media reported that after the Singapore summit, the United States had already sent North Korea several scenarios for disarmament, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them “gangster”.

Nicoy called for the displacement of the “Moscow language Ukrainian product”
Ukrainian children’s writer and fighter for the purity of the native language Larisa Nitsoy called for the expulsion of “Russian-speaking Moscow product and the Moscow language” from Ukraine.
To do this, she offers a Ukrainian product - "a cultural wave, a cultural onslaught."
His thoughts on the "purposefulness of the eradication of the Russian language in Ukraine" Nicoy shared with the Ukrainian edition "Obozrevatel".
According to her, the corresponding Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it even already exists and continues to develop further.
Over time, Ukrainians will “recover” from this “Moscow language”, she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, according to her, Russian speech used to be widely used on television and radio, but there was practically no Russian speech left in the public space.
At the same time, according to Nicoy, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only “extending the boundaries for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level”.
Previously, Nicoy shared her experience of maintaining a “Ukrainian-speaking regime” in a children’s camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened to sue the Watsons bookstore chain, the cashier of one of which spoke to her in Russian.
Having not achieved his goal, Nicoi threw a change at the girl.
She calls the use of Russian words by Ukrainians “linguistic schizophrenia”, urging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in writing surnames.
Recently, Nicoy said that the name “Rus” was stolen from the Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Muscovy.
The anger of the writer could not be avoided even the Security Service of Ukraine: having come there and heard the conversations of employees with each other in Russian, she made a scandal and left, slamming the door.
In the break held a man's conversation, and it bore fruit

"I think we wanted to win more," Kulakov said on the Urals official website.
“Such a difficult game turned out, a serious male conversation was held during the break, and this brought its fruit: they scored two goals and did not miss.
“You missed a few matches because of the damage you suffered earlier this month.
How did you feel today?”
“If it lasts 90 minutes, that’s fine.
In fact, I felt good.
Maybe in the end, a little bit of strength to make sure nothing happens.
And so, doctors and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolyevich Gashnev led me to this game, for which they are very grateful!
"What about the atmosphere in the team?"
“It’s no secret that after victories and recover easier, and the mood in the team is good.
Now we have a white stripe, although at first it was black.
We need to continue in the same spirit and please the fans.”
"Did you miss the game because you didn't go out on the field?"
“There is such a thing, a little missed, because really, the unpleasant situation came out.
But once again, thanks to the physiotherapist and doctors that put on his feet.
The most important thing is that we won and pleased the fans.
The rest is secondary.”

In the referendum in Macedonia recorded violations
Four incidents related to violations of electoral legislation were registered in the Republic of Macedonia in a referendum on an intergovernmental treaty with Greece on renaming.
This was reported on Sunday by the press Secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Tony Angelovsky.
Since the opening of the polling stations, 4 incidents have been recorded, which have been eliminated, he said.

The Ministry noted that all violations are being investigated.
The Ministry will act in accordance with the law so that citizens can peacefully exercise the constitutional right to freely express their will.
We call on citizens to respect the laws and refrain from any violation of public order and tranquility and any violation of the secrecy of the vote," the interior ministry spokesman said.
During the referendum on Sunday, citizens are asked to answer one question: “Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?”
The referendum is meant to resolve a 27-year-old dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia and Greece signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic on June 17, during a solemn ceremony on the shores of Lake Prespa, on which the border between the two countries passes.
It provides for the use of the name “Republic of North Macedonia”.

This opinion was expressed by the head of the Syrian Foreign Ministry Walid Muallem in an interview with RT TV channel, which aired on Sunday.

The head of the Syrian Foreign Ministry also stressed that the S-300 is a defensive, not an offensive system, and it is designed to protect the Syrian sky.

During the meeting, he plans to discuss with his Russian counterpart the current situation with Kosovo.
In addition, Vucic intends to ask Putin for support.
The Serbian leader made the corresponding statement during a press conference, the local newspaper Vecernje Novosti reports.
According to the source, the head of Serbia clarified that, speaking about the need for support from the Russian side, he does not mean military support on the example of Syria.
Aleksandar Vu<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> said that he did not want to allow a scenario in which there could be some major military clashes on the territory of the state.
The President of the country promised to make every effort to preserve the peace, reports the publication.
We add that according to the information of the Serbian media, the meeting of the heads of Russia and Serbia is scheduled for the upcoming Tuesday, October 2, writes "Lenta.ru".
A day earlier it became known that the Serbian president brought the state army to full combat readiness due to the situation with Kosovo.
These are the events of last Friday, when several dozen Kosovo special forces entered the territory adjacent to the lake that supplies water to the Gazivode hydroelectric power plant.
It is specified that this HPP is located in the territory of Kosovo, but at the same time it belongs to the Serbian energy system.
Kosovo declared independence from Serbia ten years ago, but Belgrade refused to recognize this fact.
In the spring of last year, the parties stopped negotiations on this issue.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, the theme of Russia in a negative way was practically absent
The head of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not exclude that it will be able to become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in solving global world problems.
“The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric to which we have almost become accustomed in recent years in relation to Russia, was now an order of magnitude more muted,” the senator said in an interview published Sunday by Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
He explained that in previous years, the Russian Federation was sometimes “designated as one of the three main threats to humanity, along with Ebola, along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this row, at least in the statement of a group of Western countries, which in this regard spoke quite unanimously.”
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, “the theme of Russia in a negative way was almost absent.”
“If you carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, I do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the choir was not absolutely accurate,” the politician said, noting that Russia “was no longer a kind of wall on which they train strikes with a tennis ball.”
The head of the relevant committee of the Federation Council does not exclude that this indicates some trend, which, in his opinion, “will highlight the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this trend may be fully manifested in a year, in two or three.”
“I do not exclude that the current session in some sense can be a turning point,” – said Kosachev, explaining that “too many examples of how with the involvement of Russia manages to move forward in international affairs.”
As an example, he cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
“Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time,” the parliamentarian added.
This is due to the fact, he believes, that there is an “adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not just a possible – an integral participant in solving global problems of our time.”
“I don’t want to make a mistake, but I have a feeling that we are somewhere passing a point beyond which the movement will no longer be a backward movement, it will be a forward movement,” he added.
Another “interesting and important feeling” in this context, Kosachev called “a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop.”
“I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if a year or two or five years ago the Russian opinion, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, by and large, no one was interested, now the situation is different,” the chairman of the committee said.
In his opinion, this is due to the fact that "the so-called new liberal order, which is personified by the West, has no answers to the questions of how to solve world problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas on how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of nuclear non-proliferation, the problems of migration."
"And here the demand for the Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious," Kosachev said, stressing that he considers "the current session a good one for the work of the Russian delegation, a good one for Russia."

In Damascus declared their right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that in the Syrian province of Idlib will not have to use military force, said the foreign Minister of the Syrian Arab Republic Walid Muallem.
He said Syria has the right to do so.
The minister added that Turkey has the opportunity to quickly solve the problem of the withdrawal of militants of the banned in Russia organization Jabhat al-Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib.
The Foreign Minister also stressed that Damascus will have to resort to a military solution to the problem of territories east of the Euphrates in case of the Kurds' desire for separatism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, the negotiations with the Kurdish forces of the SDF were good, until they were interrupted because of the United States.
On September 17, Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to create a demilitarized zone along the contact line between the armed opposition and government troops in the Syrian province of Idlib by October 15.
Terry led the youth team "Chelsea"
Earlier it was reported that the 37-year-old defender was negotiating the transition to the Moscow Spartak.
As reported by RT with reference to Mirror, the former captain of the England team John Terry headed the youth team "Chelsea".
According to the source, a well-known player who played for a long time in the London club, will lead the team not older than 23 years.
It is noted that in the coaching staff Terry will replace Jody Morris, who left for Derby County.
Recall that in September, Terry was close to moving to the Moscow Spartak, but eventually abandoned this idea after a conversation with his family.
The first vice-speaker of the Verkhovna Rada Irina Gerashchenko apologized to the convicted in the Russian Federation for "espionage" Ukrainian journalist Roman Sushchenko for the fact that he still could not be released from prison.
She said this in a video message to a political prisoner recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of Sushchenko’s illegal arrest by the FSB.
According to her, these days, under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris, there is an action, the participants of which announced a hunger protest demanding the release of the Kremlin prisoners.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, among them there are people who know you well, are starving, supporting Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course, you.
There is not a single international meeting, not a single negotiation, not a single interview, where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, did not demand to put pressure on the Kremlin, to put pressure on Putin with one demand - the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all political prisoners of the Kremlin and those guys who are illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbas and Crimea.
She also expressed confidence that the tests will harden every Ukrainian, making us “evil, tougher in protecting the national interests of Ukraine, in protecting every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what is evil.”
We will remind, the correspondent of Ukrinform in France Roman Sushchenko was detained by Russian security forces on September 30, 2016 at the Moscow airport.
On October 7, he was charged with espionage against the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.
On June 4, 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years in a strict regime colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia recognized this verdict as legal.
Russian jailers granted the last request of the Ukrainian before his transfer to the colony.

But the wife of the actor did not allow to bury the living actor, she believed that she could cope with the disease and more than a year did not leave the bed of her beloved spouse.
If it wasn't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive right now.
“Whenever I had a critical situation, she was there like a rock,” he said.
The actor managed to cope with the disease, now he lives happily in his home in the center of Tbilisi.

AdG became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant “Alternative for Germany” is breaking another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel’s ratings are falling.
Apparently, German residents are starting to get seriously tired of the immigration policy of Angela Merkel, thanks to which the country has become a coveted target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
This is most evident in recent polls, according to which the anti-immigrant party Alternative for Germany is becoming increasingly popular, and the positions of the ruling bloc Merkel and Seehofer are weakening.
This week, the AfD broke another record, rising to the second place in the rating of people's sympathy.
The right-wing conservatives, with 17 percent of the popular vote, managed to beat the Social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The one-percentage-point gap can be attributed to a statistical error, but it is worth noting the fact that the AfD created in 2013 from a small group of Eurosceptic economists managed to turn into a serious political force.
The leadership in the general standings for the time being continues to hold the ruling bloc of the CSU/CDU, which has about 30 percent.
However, there is a tendency to the loss of points - back in April, support for Angela Merkel's bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
The Social Democrats were followed by the Greens (15%), the Left (11%) and the Liberals (10%).
The Evolution of the “Alternative”
The Alternative for Germany party was founded in September 2012 on the basis of the Alternative Choice 2013 group, which included members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government’s course, but initially dealt only with economic issues, including the problems of the euro and cooperation within the EU.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany’s “sponsorship” of the EU’s weak economies, did not exclude the possibility of a return to the German mark and a full withdrawal of the country from the EU.
Against the background of the deepening immigration crisis, the political platform of the AfD has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party, which occupied a niche of eurosceptics and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the AfD managed to break into the Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of the “Alternative for Germany” received seats in the European Parliament.
A video was published with a journalist who called the citizens of Ukraine a “nation of fools”

They believe in television and don’t read much.
As Drozdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
“We have not been taught the culture of reading and accepting texts since childhood,” the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov’s words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting Nezalezhnaya began to fight literature, which has the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities, banning the import of as many as 201 publications.

Canadians have created a car in the event of an apocalypse - the magazine Driving
Anyone can buy this car.
Roshel Defence Solutions has said it is already accepting applications for its new armored vehicle.
Roshel Senator APC (Apocalypse)
On the topic of the apocalypse, money is not only made by video game manufacturers, film studios and book publishers.
Now a new niche is being developed for themselves and car companies.
Roshel Defence Solutions has unveiled the Senator APC, the armor of the apocalypse.
In their free time, the engineers of this company create armored cars for the police.
Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, who are without much comfort, but in complete safety are placed in a all-welded armored capsule.
This bunker, otherwise the design can not be called, since the level of its reservation corresponds to the standard B7, is mounted on the chassis of a powerful Ford Super Duty pickup truck.
Its bottom, also armored, is able to protect the capsule from explosions by grenades and anti-personnel mines.
The Roshel Senator APC Armory of the Apocalypse
In order not to harm passengers even an explosive wave from a projectile that exploded near the car, the car interior is equipped with special shock-absorbing seats.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire suppression system.
For safe viewing, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a system of circular cameras with night vision function, as well as an observation armored tower on the roof.
There are no weapons in the car.
Front of the Roshel Senator APC armored car
To ensure that the weight of the armored car does not affect its mobility, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-horsepower hardy turbodiesel engine with a volume of 6.7 liters, all the power of which is transmitted to the four wheels of the armored car through a 6-speed automatic transmission.
There is no chance of getting stuck at all in the armored car of the apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
You can see the Roshel Senator APC armored car at a specialized exhibition in Washington, which will be held in October.
Named the death of the universe
The universe will continue to exist for about 140 billion years, which is ten times the age of the observed world, equal to about 13.8 billion years.
The research of the international team of scientists is posted in the library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and is aimed for publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Such conclusions were made by observing with the help of the HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) telescope Subaru for about ten million galaxies.
By tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounts for more than 95 percent of the energy-mass of the observable world, the scientists, working within the standard cosmological model <0xCE><0x9B>CDM (<0xCE><0x9B> Cold Dark Matter), estimated the rate of expansion of the universe, which was slightly slower than previously thought.
In a press release, the Subaru Observatory notes that the observations made it possible to obtain a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the Universe, and accounting for the data of the European space telescope Planck clarified the restrictions imposed on the parameters of <0xCE><0x9B>CDM.
In July, scientists simulated the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments in favor of the fact that the observed world will cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Big Gap.
Failed another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum
The opportunity to know the opinion of the people on pension reform is postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the federal initiative group of the referendum against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups that registered different formulations of issues (the Central Election Commission registered five formulations in total).
They decided to apply to the CEC with a request to register a single initiative group and ask the Russians the question: "Are you in favor of the age established by the legislation on pension provision as of July 1, 2018, on the achievement of which the citizens of Russia are entitled to the appointment of an old-age pension, not increased?"
This formulation was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the simplest and most legally capacious.
The majority of the participants in the meeting were supporters of the member of “Fair Russia” Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the Communist Party (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier, Sviridov told Vedomosti that invitations were sent to all the initiators, and representatives of about 40 subgroups expressed their consent to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (her formulation was supported by 15 other subgroups), told Vedomosti that she did not receive an invitation and did not plan to come: “We did not understand who is a friend and who is an enemy.”

In the match "Loko" - "Akhmat" mistakes of Turbin fell out as out of the horn of abundance
Former All-Union judge Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of the referee Evgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the championship of Russia "Lokomotiv" - "Akhmat" and analyzed the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you assess the refereeing of Evgeny Turbin in the match "Lokomotiv" - "Akhmat"?
- I believe that this referee has confirmed his unsuitability for refereeing matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that the effort in the meeting of the fifth round of "Spartak" - "Dynamo", neither Turbin nor the leaders of the DSI did not make serious conclusions about his low qualifications.
The result did not slow down to affect in the ninth round: errors in his actions, private omissions of rough tricks poured like out of the horn of abundance.
For example, in the 50th minute, the railwayman Eder rolls up with his hands in his penalty area defender "Akhmat" Rodolfo.
It's eight meters from the gate, but the Turbine doesn't score a penalty.
- How do you assess the episode involving Idov, who was in the 82nd minute, when it seemed that the ball fell into his hand?
- I believe that there was a deliberate play by the hand of the defender in his penalty area.
Turbine was close to the moment, well seeing this episode and his first assistant on the right.
This moment should have seen and reserve judge Sergei Karasev.
However, all three fell asleep and a penalty was not imposed.
Therefore, the score in the match was distorted, and sports justice was trampled.
This was the case when judging by concepts supplanted and buried the sporting spirit of the game.
- In the 52nd minute, Turbin did not dare to remove the guest defender Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules in the fight against Krykhovyak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, he demonstratively applauded him.
What do you think of this episode?
You had to show the second "mustard"?
- At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card showed not quite on the case.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about double standards of refereeing that some teams are put on penalties for such violations, as in the episode with Idova, and some are not.
What do you think of the footballer’s words?
Depends on what you mean by double standards.
There was a penalty.
They didn't.
So the arbiter doesn't give a second penalty in the opposite gate.
This is the principle used.
And the second point of double standards is that the referee watches who is playing.
I played Lokomotiv on Saturday and Akhmat have serious complaints about the work of Turbin, because the team was infringed.
Matt Damon played the accused of rape judge Kavanaugh at the start of SNL
American actor Matt Damon played the US Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first episode of the new season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.
During a small sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh at a Senate hearing on rape charges.
The U.S. Supreme Court candidate previously drew attention to his emotionality and detailing of his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobuchar.
Kavanaugh has repeatedly admitted his love of beer, but said that he never got drunk to death.
In addition, in an attempt to acquit himself of the rape charge, Kavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin at the time.
These moments were also played by Damon.
All I did was drink a lot and not think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, drunkest virgin anyone had ever seen.
Everyone knows it,” said Matt Damon, the judge.
Kavanaugh was previously elected U.S. Supreme Court Justice.
Barbra Streisand discovers strange behavior in her cloned dogs
American singer Barbra Streisand said that the clones of her dead dog behave completely differently than the original pet.
“They are not similar.
In fact, [the clones] look like her, but it is impossible to clone the soul," the 76-year-old singer said.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old coton-de-tulear dog named Samantha, who had to be put to sleep due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that a Chihuahua dog named Miracle Milly, who was called the smallest dog in the world, was cloned for the 49th time.
Experts are cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The United States thought about the naval blockade of Russia because of the supply of oil and gas
In the United States can begin a naval blockade of Russia to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
U.S. authorities are so eager to fight for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to a naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's main suppliers of energy.
About the possibility of a naval blockade on the eve of the US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said.
Contrary to world practice, the U.S. Department of the Interior performs not police, but civilian functions, including the implementation of policies in the field of natural resources.
Therefore, the statement of Zinke came out quite within the competence of the department headed by him, although it was not devoid of political color.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that thanks to the U.S. Navy, the U.S. controls maritime routes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
According to Zinke, the need may be related to Washington’s desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives the lion's share of its revenues from supplies to the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for Moscow’s activation in this region, Zinke is sure.
The minister made it clear that the United States still expects to secure leadership in the global energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to push Russia and Iran, and a sea blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure on this path, Zinke believes.

Formula 1 Russian Grand Prix Race
There is a club in Russia that I follow.
Former captain of Chelsea and England John Terry - about why he attended the match of the ninth round of the championship of Russia "Spartak" - "Rostov" (0: 1).
“In Russia, I have a club that I follow.
I’ve been watching it for a while now and I’m interested to see it from the outside.
“I can’t say I’m a fan because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartak and once again I want to apologize for the decision I made.”
We will remind, "Rostov" with 18 points rose to the third place in the standings, and "Spartak" is on the fifth line, having in the asset 15 points.

Expensive violin handed over to the pawnshop for a pittance
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan pawnshop in Somerville, Massachusetts, he offered only $50 for a tool that looked old and unpresentable.
But experienced store manager Dylan McDermitt suspected that this is an old and expensive tool, and sought advice from an expert.
It turned out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinando Galliano and is estimated at 250 thousand dollars.
Only the bows to the violin are estimated at 16-18 thousand dollars.
The investigation revealed that the violin was recently stolen from one of the residents of the city, and the instrument was returned to the rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin got to the person who handed it over to the pawnshop, but no previous clashes with the law are listed behind it.
The manager says that now everyone who brings the violin to the pawnshop will be asked to play it to make sure that it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round of the RPL, an exciting confrontation awaits us: Spartak will host Rostov at its stadium in Tushino under the leadership of Valery Karpin - a man, as you know, not at all alien to the "people's team".
The special piquancy of this meeting is given by the fact that the clubs now have an equal number of points - 15 each, and they share 3 and 4 places in the standings, lagging behind the far-jumping Zenit and being in one point from Krasnodar, which tomorrow plays with Dynamo.
The red and whites now have a difficult streak: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the Europa League, Massimo Carrera’s team suddenly flew into Rapida, and recently gave way to Akhmat at home.
After the derby with CSKA, which ended in a fair draw, "Spartak" with a minimum score and not without difficulty beat in the Cup "Chernomorets", and it is too early to talk about whether the most popular club of Russia is approaching a way out of the crisis.
"Rostov" three matches in a row could not win, but he does not know defeats for five matches.
Let's see if Karpin will be able to extend the win-win series with such a fundamental match for himself.
The previous meeting of Karpinsky "Rostov" with "Spartak" ended in favor of the capital team.
Starts at 7:00.

London is bursting with accusations against Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the outcome of the Cold War, British Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson has said.
But England will defend its values, he stressed during a speech at the congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham.
Threats are growing, Iran and North Korea are becoming more dangerous, and enemies are operating in gray areas with the help of cyberattacks and fake news, the minister added.
But the largest of them is Russia, which is increasing its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements of Western politicians Moscow has repeatedly denied, reports TASS.
At the same time, the head of the British Foreign Ministry Jeremy Hunt said that Russia will have to pay a high price if it does not adhere to international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the poisoning story in the English city of Salisbury in March of this year, former GRU Colonel Sergei Skripal, convicted of espionage in favor of Great Britain, and his daughter Julia.
In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a referendum on joining the EU and NATO is held, subject to a change in the country's name.
The referendum is meant to resolve a 27-year-old dispute with neighboring Greece over the name of the country, which coincides with the name of the neighboring Greek province.
One of the first to vote was Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a fervent supporter of renaming the republic to North Macedonia.
Preparations for the referendum and today's vote are being monitored by international organizations.
The head of the observation mission of the Bureau for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Jan Petersen, told Euronews how the work of observers is organized:
Approximately 100 teams have travelled across the country to observe the whole process today, from the opening of polling stations to their closing, then the counting of votes and the drafting of protocols.
During the month, 10 of our teams worked in the country, which monitored the preparation for the vote, the work of the media, compliance with the law on the financing of election campaigns and the organization of the referendum.
Fei Dulgeri: “About 500 foreign observers are closely monitoring the voting process.
The observer groups record in detail what is happening and communicate with the members of the election commissions, and then present them in the final report.
The translator compared the mentality of Russians and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a big role for mutual understanding.
On the International Day of the Translator, September 30, professional interpreter-synchronist Berbel Saxe told about it.
She has been translating from Russian and English for more than 30 years.
"The Germans like to plan events quietly, and the Russians, as the saying goes, "long harness, let's go fast."
But it seems to me that for mutual understanding between peoples and for the work of an interpreter, this does not play a significant role," the expert said in a comment to RIA Novosti.
According to the translator, to understand that the two countries can not do without each other, "it is enough to know history."
And in the future, Saxe noted, it makes no sense for Germany to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny,” she said.
A day earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the country is trying to “establish relations” with Russia and maintain them.
According to her, the project of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is being built from the coast of Russia to Germany along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, is especially important for Berlin mania.

Comedy "Evening School" headed the American box office
The comedy “Evening School”, which debuted in American cinemas last Friday, earned $ 28 million for its first weekend at the box office.
This result allowed an uncomplicated picture with Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish in the lead roles to lead the US box office for September 28-30.
On the international market, the film, so far released only in 20 countries, collected $5.5 million, including 2 million from British viewers.
In the struggle for the first line, the creation of Malcolm Lee, which is remarkable, quite noticeably ahead of another newcomer to Western rental - the cartoon "Smallfoot", a curious story of acquaintance of a charming yeti with a representative of the human race, in the existence of which the main character never believed.
The project, directed by Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig, raised $23 million over its opening weekend, generally meeting the expectations of experts, who predicted the tape to be 20-25 million over the weekend.
As for the total fees of “Smallfoot”, at the moment they amount to $ 38.6 million (at the same time it debuted in 50 countries): the most active here was Mexico, which replenished the treasury of the film by 3.6 million.
The three strongest this time was closed by the children's fairy tale "The Secret of the House with a Clock" from the master of horror, Eli Roth, which finally proved that the director knows how to make a quality movie for an audience of 12+.
In its second week at the box office, the film adaptation of John Bellers’ book with the charming Jack Black with Kate Blanchett earned $12.5 million, bringing the total fees around the world to 53.8 million.
Despite the departure from the top 3, continues to surprise with the sign of "+" thriller with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick "Simple request": in 17 days at the American box office, the picture of Paul Fig, from which some unreal financial achievements were initially not expected from the word "totally", has collected $43 million (including 6.6 million right now and 30 million right now).
The last representative of the top five this week was the horror “The Curse of the Nun”, which collected $ 5.4 million during the reporting period.
The spin-off "The Spell" on the results of 24 days in American (and not only, of course) cinemas has $330 million in total earnings and recently proudly bears the title of the most successful film in the franchise, which also includes two parts of the "The Spell" and two films about the terrible Annabelle doll.
Just after the horror Corinna Hardy at the end of last weekend, there was another representative of the genre - the debutant of Hellfest, one of the main youth horrors of the year.
In his first weekend, the brainchild of the famous editor (and with a recent director) Gregory Plotkin, who previously worked in a number of large horror projects, including "Happy Day of Death", which "Hallfest" is very similar in some places, earned in the United States $ 5.1 million.
Given the modest budget of the film, the result is extremely positive.
The seventh was "Insanely rich Asians" ($ 4.15 million), which, it seems, do not think to fall from the top 10 of the American box office: a romantic comedy that has been on the screens for the seventh week, at the end of September is the sixth in the ranking of the highest-grossing tapes of the genre in history with an indicator of 165.7 million.
This is the amount of the picture at the moment earned in the domestic market - the total revenue of the tape is 218.8 million.

From the other premieres of the coming week, it is worth highlighting the musical-melodrama "A Star is Born", the winner of the Venice Film Festival from Bradley Cooper, and the criminal drama "Your Hate".

“My colleague spoke about the fans of Siberia, and I want to note our fans,” said Belov on the official website of Vityaz.
“I hope they will also support it, because now almost every game is full of stadium, great atmosphere.
In the game, perhaps, the Lord helped Siberia today, because they were very grossly mistaken, especially our leaders.

But I will still take the blame.
Because, apparently, we missed something in preparation.
Compared to the last game, it was a different team.”
"It's ugly cronyism"
Viewers are outraged by the choice of Agutin on the show "Voice"
The audience of the show "Voice 60+" accuses the mentor Leonid Agutin of "obscene nepotism and brazen rigging."
When in the blind auditions he from the first notes recognized the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not return to the performer.
But the son's feelings prevailed, and he chose a relative on his team.
Then many considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor bias in the first stage.
But the "joke" dragged on, and the father of the star absolutely unjustifiably took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutina such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the audience of the show, were outraged by the nepotism of the ugly and frank dragging their close relatives to the final stairs.
I even doubted that Agutin will have enough strength and conscience not to drag his dad to the end to the first place," - reasoned Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina in the program "The Man from the TV".
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agutin "merged" beautiful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining this by the fact that the audience still wants to see his father in the show.
But, as it turned out, this is not the case at all, the audience wants an objective assessment and to see really talented performers in the final, and now Agutin discredited the show.
“I sympathize with the members of the Voice from Agutin’s team – they were doomed.”
“Last time, Agutin showed how much he loved his father, and today he had to show himself as a professional.”
"The contest has lost its meaning."
“Remove two talented people from the project and leave your dad in the project who does not sing but whispers, how can you call a mentor after that?”
“If you like how dad sings, give him a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people will come to this concert.”
It's the Voice show, not the Cruel Relatives show.
"On Agutin's part, it was unprofessional."
"Then you have to offer to perform on your own show to dad, and not on the show, which is done for the money of 1 Channel."
“It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone’s place.
And I don’t understand why a voiceless dad should make me understand more than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why did a worker from Surgut with a magnificent voice and timbre merge, and Agutin’s dad was brought to the final?
And then we all complain that on the stage and from the screens the same faces for decades!
“You can’t go through the maze!”
"What were you waiting for?
This is Russia!
Around the swamp and nepotism.
And the money in the family budget will not be superfluous!
The theater of the absurd continues!
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Voice" at the blind auditions went son Gradsky.
Then the meter and it did not come to mind to take my son to his own team.
Moreover, he said, "Come on, get out of here, everything is clear."
Agutin could not act as a professional.

This was discussed at a conference in St. Petersburg for representatives of the construction industry.
Due to amendments to the law on shared construction, developers will have to be fully credited to the bank.
And many experts have already started talking about a possible strong rise in prices of apartments.
But as it turned out, not everyone agrees with this.

The scientist told about the possible scientific program of the expedition of the Russian Federation to the moon
The head of the Institute of Space Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Anatoly Petrukovich told RIA Novosti about a possible research program for Russian astronauts on the moon.
According to him, now the scientific community is developing areas of such work.
"There is no consolidated opinion yet," the scientist stressed.
He noted that one of the options is the placement of a low-frequency radio telescope on the back of the moon, which would avoid interference, the source of which is the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to study space sources of radio emission," Petrukovich added.
He also believes that the moon could be used for testing robotics, use local resources for construction.
In addition, astronauts should be involved in the search for primitive organics on the Earth's satellite, the scientist believes.
This could help determine how life appears on planets.
Earlier, the head of the corporation "Roscosmos" said that in an optimistic version of the Russian Federation can make a manned flight to the moon by 2030.

This was stated by the Minister of internal Affairs of the United States Ryan Zinke.
Speaking at an industrial event in the US city of Pittsburgh, the head of the department said that for the Russian economy, the only source of income is the sale of energy, and Moscow is actively pursuing a policy in the Middle East to sell oil and gas there, as it does in Europe.
Zinke also noted that a similar situation is with Iran.
To solve it, according to the Minister, there are two options for the development of events: military and economic.
First, he would prefer not to use, so it is necessary to exert pressure and displace Iranian energy resources.

Sergey Sirotkin: I could not do anything, and it was very painful
Russian driver of Williams Sergey Sirotkin commented on the result of the race Grand Prix of Russia.
“Honestly, I don’t really want to talk about what’s in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second corner I was between two cars that immediately pinched me.
I lost all the positions I played at the start, instantly.
He was in a very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
We hoped that after the rest of the pit stop, we would get into the "clean air", and the pace would return, but the rubber was no longer there.
Plus he fought with his partner, he also had contact with him.
As I understand it, he was a little bit wrong.
We found ourselves in such a situation on the most unbeaten track of the season, there was nothing I could do, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don’t want to talk about it anymore,” Sirotkin told RIA Novosti.
Recall that Sirotkin in the race at the Grand Prix of Russia finished 18th, the winner was the British driver "Mercedes" Lewis Hamilton.
Tarpishev called the absurd removal of Glushakov and Yeshchenko from the basis of "Spartacus"
The President of the Federation of tennis of Russia (FTR) Shamil Tarpishchev commented on the suspension of players of the Moscow "Spartak" Denis Glushakov and Andrei Yeshchenko from training with the main squad after the likes of criticism of the head coach of the team Massimo Carrera, reports "Sport weekend".
Carrera’s actions were absolutely absurd.
Paying attention to such things is foolishness.
I totally disagree with what Carrera is doing.
It only deepens the disunity within the team.
First, these are poems, you can read and perceive them as you like.
I wouldn't have reacted to that if I were Carrera.
Everyone has an opinion.
Secondly, everyone wants to get sick.
If Glushakov and Yeshchenko like, it does not mean that they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility to perceive the situation.
And that doesn't serve the normal team climate.
Today, Spartak does not have a game, so this situation did not need to be inflated at all.
Maybe we should have laughed about it together.
Spartak has a lot in order in different lines, there is a lack of playability after the introduction of young people.
Relations within the team, apparently, do not add optimism before this match,” – said Tarpishchev.
The game of the two teams will be held on September 30 and will begin at 19.00 Moscow time.
Previously refused “Spartacus” John Terry headed the youth team “Chelsea”.
The pupils of "Sirius" discussed with scientists nature-like technologies
Students of the Sirius Educational Center in Sochi, participants of the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists of the Kurchatov Institute National Research Center.
The presentation of the researchers took place within the framework of the program of the Global International Forum of convergent and nature-like technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the website of the educational center on September 29.
The lecture was opened by the documentary film Kurchatov Codes, during which the President of the Kurchatov Institute, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Mikhail Kovalchuk spoke about global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
The scientist’s lecture is published on the Sirius website.
Students have learned that modern technology needs a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing such volumes.
To solve this problem, according to the organizers of the forum, will help nature-like technologies, which today are working on young scientists.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of nature-like technologies, and also spoke about the risks that inevitably arise when creating such technologies.
“The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a huge benefit.
This is an explosive growth of medical technology, it is an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's another side.
The development of nature-like technologies is in fact a technological reproduction of living systems.
There is a flip side - a targeted intervention in the life of a person.
There are always risks.
There was a car - people began to die under the wheels.
Cars are still being used.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I am creating a medical new technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction," the scientist said.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, students were able to ask questions to the participants of the meeting.
The speakers were the candidate of physical and mathematical sciences, the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBICS-nature-like technologies of the SIC "Kurchatov Institute" Yulia Dyakov and the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBICS-technologies Vyacheslav Demin.
The Sirius Educational Center in Sochi was created by the Talent and Success Educational Foundation on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure on the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The purpose of the educational center is the early identification, development and further professional support of gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that the winners of the all-Russian online information security Olympiad "Cyber Challenge" will be sent to study in "Sirius".
Air traffic controller saved the life of a plane with passengers during an earthquake in Indonesia
In Indonesia, said goodbye to the air traffic controller Antonius Gunawan Agung, who at the cost of his life saved hundreds of passengers of the airline Batik Air.

21-year-old dispatcher had to jump from a height of four floors.
When he fell, he suffered serious injuries to his internal organs, and the doctors could not save him.

The greatest danger to the U.S. Navy is the Russian submarine Kazan.
This was stated by US Rear Admiral Dave Johnson, Rosbalt reports with reference to The National Interest.
“We are facing a serious potential enemy.
It is enough just to look at Severodvinsk," he said, pointing to the model-predecessor of Kazan.

Macedonia: No referendum held due to low turnout
The referendum was supposed to approve the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje on renaming the Balkan country “North Macedonia”.
Greece objected to the Macedonians' use of the name of their historical province.
The renaming promised the former Yugoslav republic an opening to NATO and later to the EU.
But, according to the agency EFE, only 34% of the turnout at Sunday’s plebiscite “did not reach” the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only consultative, the authorities in Skopje may decide not to abandon the renaming.
Speaking shortly after the polls closed, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a supporter of changing the name of the republic, said that if there were more “yes” among the votes cast, Macedonia would change the name, despite the unreached quorum.

Kemerovchan infuriated a flock of sheep in the cemetery
September 30 on the famous Kemerovo page in the social network there was a message from an eyewitness that in one of the local cemeteries cattle roam freely.
The animals walked between the fences and plucked the grass.
Commentators expressed different opinions: someone from the locals noted that there is no harm in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery, and their appetite can even help in clearing the territory of weeds and thickets of grass, but some of the residents of the city did not like the behavior of animals:
“These are graves, not pastures.
There's nothing for the sheep to do there.
Of course, you can’t say about the sheep that they are blaspheming, but it’s not the case.” (the style is preserved) – said in her message the outraged Kemerovo resident.
One way or another, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem in the form of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and soon the necessary measures will be taken.
Pushing and pushing - how right?
There is no word for pressure.
That's right, push.
The word "press" in the meaning of "pull, exert influence, influence" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "suffer".
We use this word, assuming that it comes from the word "pressure".
But "pressure" and "satisfy" are etymologically not only not close, but even in some sense opposite.
See for yourself.
To endure (church-book, obsolete) means "sufficiently, fully, sufficiently, to be sufficient for someone or something, to satisfy".
Satisfaction, pleasure - related words.
Previously, it still had the meaning of "not to depend on anything, to have a self-sufficient value" - "to satisfy oneself."
The Old Slavonic "dovlti" is related to the words "to command" and "will".
Pushing and pushing are completely different.
These words have truly frightening "relatives": daos - "wolf" (suppressing sheep), deyja - "to die" and dvaid<0xC4><0xAB> - "to oppress".
The similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "satisfy", as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, forced them to enter into contamination.
So we have this very "d[a]ply", which is also used in writing through the "a", which, in a good way, is wrong and impossible from the point of view of the processes of origin and development of these words.
So, it is right to push.
But this word is obsolete, in its correct meaning no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word “pressure”.
You can also use the "pressure" design, but remember that this is a chancellery.

What's the reason?"
“My attempt was not bad, but then there was one of the Mercedes drivers in front.
He was preparing to try and still managed to miss me, but it seems I lost some time on it.
However, it is unlikely that this has greatly influenced the result."
"In Sochi it is very difficult to overtake, the start of the race will be a key moment?"
“Maybe, but you never know how it’s going to turn out.
It will not be easy in any case, because our car is noticeably slower than Mercedes cars.

Vu<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> left the highest level of combat readiness of the Serbian army in force
Serbian President Aleksandar Vu<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> has ordered to maintain the highest level of combat readiness, which was brought to the armed forces of the country because of the situation in the north of the autonomous province of Kosovo and Metohija.
"The president has ordered to maintain the highest level of combat readiness, there will be a separate order to cancel it," Serbian Defense Minister Aleksandar Vulin said on Sunday, quoted by TASS.
According to him, the head of state is deeply concerned about the developments in Kosovo.
At the same time, Vulin boasted, the president of the republic expressed "pleasure with the energy, labor, readiness and speed of the Serbian military."
Vucic himself said yesterday that he intends to discuss the situation in Kosovo and Metohija with Russian President Vladimir Putin and ask the Russian leader for support.
According to reports, the meeting is scheduled for October 2 and should take place in Moscow.
At the same time, the Serbian leader stressed that he would do everything to preserve peace, and noted that he would like his country to be a peaceful, economically successful country of the future.

Refugees and migrants should not be considered different, and migration itself is the mother of that society.
Numerous migrant communities and anti-racism organizations sent an open letter to the Minister demanding his resignation.
with the help of the operation in Syria, Russia has protected itself from terrorists
Over the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100,000 terrorists were killed, of which 85,000 terrorists were destroyed by the Russian Aerospace Forces.
This was said in connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria, the former commander-in-chief of the VKS, the head of the Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security Viktor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of means of destruction from the air: the Air and Space Forces inflicted and continue to inflict all strikes exactly on the objects of terrorists.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist facilities have been destroyed in Syria over the past three years, including ammunition depots, fortifications and headquarters.
With the help of Russian air strikes, the defense of jihadists was hacked - this became a decisive contribution to the promotion of Syrian government troops, Interfax reports.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria allowed to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IS, banned in Russia) and Jabhat al-Nusra (banned in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, about four thousand militants from among Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries fought on the side of ISIS.
And we are talking only about recorded persons, not counting those who have not been identified, Bondarev stressed.
Most of them were trained and ready at any time to take up arms, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory of our country.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism at distant borders - otherwise this evil "would flow to us."

Syria accuses U.S. of supporting terrorism
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem has accused the United States and its partners of war crimes in Syria and supporting terrorism.
The [Western] coalition completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, it destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas against which its actions were directed, it committed mass killings of civilians, including children and women.
These killings under international law are war crimes,” he said.
According to Muallem, the United States and its partners provided “direct support to terrorists” because the goals of the militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided and meant “sowing chaos, death and destruction in their path.”
The Foreign Minister also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost completed, and the country has become safer and more stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intends to clear Syria of the illegal foreign presence, and priority in the reconstruction of the country will be given to the Syrian partners.
In September, the head of the Russian Center for Reconciliation of the warring parties in the republic, Lieutenant General Vladimir Savchenko, said that two American F-15 aircraft struck the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor with banned phosphorus ammunition.
The U.S. denied all the accusations.
President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko believes that while respecting the sovereignty of other states, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The head of state said this during a trip to the Kharkiv region, commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports in Transcarpathia.
Protecting Ukrainian citizens, I defend the sovereignty of our state.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other states, we demand the same respect for Ukraine,” Poroshenko said.
According to Poroshenko, as president, he will protect Ukrainian citizens, wherever they are - in the east or in the west of the country.
At the same time, the head of state supported the Foreign Ministry’s position in the passport scandal with Hungary, which consists in the intention to expel the consul of this country from Beregovo.
"I fully share every letter that is said by the Foreign Ministry," the President said.
As reported by “FACTS”, on September 19, a video appeared on the network, which recorded the moment of issuing Hungarian passports to citizens of Ukraine in the Consulate of Hungary in Berehove.
They swore an oath of allegiance to Hungary.
The Minister of foreign Affairs of Ukraine Pavlo Klimkin noted that the Consul of Hungary, who appears in the video with the distribution of Ukrainian Hungarian passports, must leave the territory of Ukraine either by the decision of Budapest itself, or will be expelled by Kiev.
It also became known that the Prosecutor’s office of the Transcarpathian region opened a criminal case on the fact of issuing passports of Hungary.
The incident is classified under the article "State treason".
Putin secretly arrived in Siberia
It is known that Vladimir Putin spent the last two days in Dushanbe, where he took part in the work of the Council of CIS States, and also held a number of bilateral meetings with the presidents of neighboring countries.
Flight data from Russia’s Flightradar website show that around 6 p.m. Tajikistan time on September 28, the Il-96-300 took off from Dushanbe airport and headed north-east.
In the area of Lake Balkhash, the transponder of the aircraft was turned off.
The direction of its flight indicates that the liner could fly to Khakassia.
According to the Baikal24 news agency, the head of the region Viktor Zimin personally met the president in Abakan on the night of September 29.
According to unofficial information, Putin flew to the republic to spend the weekend, but the sources of the site believe that the real reason is "the problem of the second round."
Next Sunday in Khakassia should be held the second round of elections of the head of the region.
It was attended by Valentin Konovalov (KPRF) and the current head of the republic Viktor Zimin ("United Russia").
However, on September 21, Zimin withdrew his candidacy.
In the upcoming tour together with Konovalov should take part Andrei Filyagin ("Fair Russia").
Khakassian media suggest that Putin may accept the resignation of the head of Khakassia and appoint a new acting head of the republic, as well as make a decision on the fate of Zimin.
Putin already visited Khakassia in January this year.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the president’s favorite places to relax.
More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the beginning of the armed conflict, which has been going on in Syria for seven years.
About five million people have fled to other countries, most notably neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Now, according to Damascus, the hostilities are coming to an end, and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
This was stated by Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem, speaking at the UN: "Currently, the situation on the ground has become more stable and secure due to the successes achieved in the fight against terrorism.
The Government is continuing the reconstruction work in the areas destroyed by the terrorists, bringing them back to normal life.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions, which have complicated people's lives and deprived them of their livelihood.
The Syrian authorities also called on the international community to facilitate the return of refugees and to allocate funds for this.
Meanwhile, the United States and European Union countries refuse to provide assistance to Syria, saying that first of all a political solution to the conflict should be found.
“Volkswagen” fully admitted his guilt in “dieselgate” in January 2017.
In December last year, Oliver Schmidt, one of the managers of the American division of the company, was sentenced to seven years in prison.
The group’s losses are estimated at at least 25 billion euros.
This amount includes not only fines and compensation.
By June of next year, the automaker is required to buy or repair 85% of the cars involved in the scandal.
In February, the company’s management said that the commitments have already been fulfilled for 83% of cars, so the program will be completed ahead of schedule.
"Volkswagen" is trying to compensate for losses and regain the trust of customers.
Thus, the management of the concern has recently changed again, and large-scale restructuring and fundamental changes in the management system have been announced.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesels on their streets: this is the right of the authorities received in February this year.

Metropolitan Hilarion compared the decision of Kiev to rename the UOC with the actions of the fascists
The head of the Synodal Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Hilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against Jews.
“It’s like in fascist Germany to put a yellow pointed star on a Jew, it means to mark the Church as an enemy organization, and it was for this purpose that this bill was created,” the metropolitan said on the Rossiya-24 TV channel.
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control over the UOC and “put it out of the law,” the cleric believes.
“This is the Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country,” he added.
Earlier it became known that the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter involves the renaming of the UOC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
The governor of the Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
The governor of the Holy Dormition Pochaev Lavra, Metropolitan Vladimir, made a call to protect the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his appeal to the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the website of the monastery.
At different times in history, our predecessors and relatives in faith and spirit Christians had to confess their faith and defend their shrines.
Given the situation that has developed, and the information that we have, and the threats of reprisals that are spreading, it is clear that we will also have to survive something," the metropolitan said.
He asked for support - prayerful, moral.
The governor of the Lavra also stressed that it is likely that "your physical presence will be needed."
The priest added: "Lenin's grandchildren, in spirit, threaten with reprisal, and therefore we will defend our shrine."
Anyone who is not indifferent to the fate of the Pochaev Lavra, an Orthodox Ukrainian and worldly shrine, must be ready to protect it.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do not be deceived by those who mislead the believers.”
The UOC has the canonical status defined by the Tomos of October 29, 1990 from the Mother Church.
And now someone wants to impose dependence on the new-style patriarch and friend of the Roman Catholic pope Bartholomew.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are satisfied with the status that our church has,” said the governor of the lavra.
He recalled that the UOC since October 1990 is canonically independent and completely independent in its management.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, our church already has a Tomos.
What other Tomos do we need?" said Metropolitan Vladimir of Pochayiv, urging believers and all citizens to ask whether other Tomos denominations have, are they independent from the Vatican?
To some extent, believers have figured out and decided which temple to go to.
However, someone wants to sow enmity and discord again.
Some are jealous that the domes on the temples that they want to destroy are shining,” the priest said.
Pochaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
Lavra is located on the top of Pochaev mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopil.
The first historical information about it dates back to the beginning of the 13th century.
The club was evacuated after a bomb was reported.

If we keep playing the right way, the wins will come.
The head coach of the Moscow "Dynamo" Vladimir Vorobyov - about the defeat of the "Motorist" (0: 1) in the match of the regular championship of the KHL.
"It was a good game, interesting, although it went to the goal," Vorobyov said on the official website of the Motorist.
“We tried to play very easy.
I really liked the first period.
I didn’t use a lot of good moments.
In the second period, the opponent pushed us a little, we survived.
But the removal of us a little "fed".
The guys played well, performed the coaching installation.
I think if we keep playing the right way, the wins will come.
Not scored, with zero goals, the game is not won, but the content of the game itself was correct.
Success will come if we continue to play in this direction.”
"In your opinion, the "Motorist" added compared to the meeting in Nizhny Novgorod?"
“We didn’t play a foreign team.
In the pre-season, the teams solved other tasks, many young guys played.
I think there was a completely different game, a different hockey.
“The driver is a good team.
According to the tournament table, it is clear that the team is playing correctly.
Good hockey, good atmosphere both in the arena and in the city.
We can only wish them good luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
There are a lot of good players, there are leaders.
Good defense, good goalkeeper.
It was hard, we were preparing.
They knew that the team was going undefeated, they wanted to break it, but it didn’t work out.”

The U.S. is satisfied with the growth of opiate production in Afghanistan
Much was said about the sharp aggravation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26 in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by the Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, in the Afghan territory, the militants unleashed a real terrorist war against the state authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year was a record for the number of bloody terrorist attacks that killed thousands of ordinary Afghans,” Patrushev said.
Afghanistan’s troubles did not begin yesterday.
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the main enemy of the United States was declared the terrorist group "Al-Qaeda" (banned in Russia), settled in Afghanistan.
Less than a month later, the United States and its NATO allies launched Operation Enduring Freedom there.
It's been 17 years.
Thousands of U.S. troops are still on Afghan soil.
And the peaceful life is even more ghostly than it was then.
U.S. troops have been driven behind fences at dozens of their bases.
How can they buy from the militants for money - as long as they do not touch them.
The government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country's territory - 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% - the movement "Taliban" (banned in Russia).
Another 10% - for ISIS terrorists (banned in Russia).
But they are growing fast there.
The goal – to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia – is exactly what they did not succeed in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be fine with that.
How satisfied is the fact that during 17 years of the American presence, the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
A colossal increase in areas sown with opium poppy and multibillion-dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the country's name.
The agreement on the renaming of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on June 17 as a result of long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize its northern neighbor's right to be called Macedonia, seeing in such a name an attempt on the Greek province of the same name and Greek history.
Ljupko Petkovski, political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia gets the right to a better future, the hope for social change.
And Greece will secure the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises and cannot make everyone happy.”
The ruling Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are in favor of renaming the country.
Against - the conservative opposition and the country's President Gheorghe Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, Macedonia does not make sense to join the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with it: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government led by Zaev is imposed from the outside in order to change the country's name.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First, the loss of sovereignty.
Obviously, there are countries that would not like Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.
Fei Dulgeri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crossroads.
The choice that the citizens of Macedonia will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but of Europe as a whole.”
