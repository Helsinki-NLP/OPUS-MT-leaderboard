Semilarski against the Prosecutor’s office: the cassation of the former Vice-Mayor of Tartu will be considered on August 4
This means that a decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The courts of the two first instances refused to consider Semilarski’s claim, but in April his cassation appeal was accepted by the State Court.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, as its authorisation was not within the competence of the Administrative Court.
The court decision stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damage caused in the course of criminal proceedings.
“The prosecutor’s office and the district court should regulate such issues,” Tartu Courts spokeswoman Annette Kreitsmann told ERR earlier.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed this decision in the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
The State Court will now have its say.
According to Semilarski’s lawyer, juror Oliver Nyaes, his client had been under suspicion of bribery for about two years.
Now he demands from the prosecutor’s office to refute the false allegations against him and to compensate him for the moral damage.
The reason for filing the complaint to the court were the statements of the prosecutor for special cases of the Lyuna District Prosecutor’s Office Margus Gross, made by him in October 2017, when Semilarski, together with another at the time, Deputy Mayor of Tartu Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of committing several crimes.
“When I was arrested, the Security Police and the Prosecutor’s Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu – one of the most powerful bodies of local self-government – are corrupt.
These public suspicions hung in the air accompanied me for about two years.
And now, when these allegations and suspicions turned out to be false, the prosecutor’s office does not want to say anything about it,” Semilarski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Njaes, at the press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the prosecutor’s office should operate.
“The allegations of bribery and bribery turned out to be false, but that’s not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia, as well as on Lithuania, that at the stage of the investigation, representatives of the state should be careful when choosing words, so that suspects are not represented as criminals before sentencing.
The prosecutor’s office is bound by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not respected in this case against Valvo Semilarski,” Njaes said.
“The public presentation of Semilarski as a serious offender and a briber in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being clarified is unacceptable, which contradicts the presumption of innocence and is unfair to the applicant,” the lawyer added.
According to rus.err.ee, former Deputy Mayor of Tartu Valvo Semilarski will not be prosecuted on charges of bribery - the criminal case against him in July was partially closed.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on a particularly large scale.
According to the indictment, in the period from 2015 to 2017, the former Deputy Mayor of Tartu more than thirty times participated in the meetings of the city administration in making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with the owners or managers of which Semilarski actively communicated on a personal level during off-hours.
According to Gross, in all these cases, Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to withdraw from participation in decision-making.
Earlier, as reported by rus.err.ee, the prosecutor's office has presented Semilarski suspicions of receiving a bribe and violation of anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on a particularly large scale.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centre Party).
The prosecutor’s office and the security police said there was strong evidence against the two vice-mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
Suvorov’s case later went to court, which fully justified the politician.
The trial in the case of Valvo Semilarski is still ongoing.

How the decision of the Central Bank to reduce the key rate will affect the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to lower the key rate again.
It fell by another 0.25 percentage point, to 4.25% per annum - formally the next historical minimum.
Judging by the return of the short step of lowering the rate, as well as the tone of the Central Bank's statements and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator looks at the economic prospects more optimistic than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary easing may soon stop.
“We have continued easing monetary policy, first of all, given that the risks of inflation deviating from 4% in 2021 still remain,” Elvira Nabiullina, head of the Bank of Russia, said in a statement.
They are associated with a significant decrease in economic activity, a drop in domestic and external demand.
The economic recovery, according to Nabiullina, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes were revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand were restored, construction and production of consumer goods were expanded, the annual rate of decline in transport turnover and industrial production slowed down.
According to the updated forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020 the contraction of the economy will be 4.5-5.5% (previously expected 4-6%), and the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the forecast for annual oil prices to $ 38 and $ 40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Earlier, the Central Bank expected $ 27 and $ 35 per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia’s inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia’s view of the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the easing cycle, according to economists for Russia and the CIS Renaissance Capital Sofia Donets and Andrei Melashchenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia consistently reduces the key rate for more than a year, since the beginning of last summer it has already fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it by one percentage point due to low inflation due to subdued demand and the need to stimulate the economy slowed down due to the pandemic and related restrictions.
The chances of adjusting monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees chief analyst of Rosbank Evgeny Koshelev.
The combination of pro-inflationary risks also points to the proximity of a pause in interest-rate easing – disrupted supply chains, possible cost increases due to epidemic prevention measures, and a faster (than expected) recovery in demand, he says.
In conclusion, the Bank of Russia’s subsequent actions will require more attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased against the background of geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev points out.
One way or another, the reduction in the key rate will lead to a further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, perhaps, on the mortgage, says Maxim Petronevich, a senior economist at the analytical department of Otkritie Bank.

Excess requirements for public procurement applications will be excluded by law
The law may establish exhaustive requirements for applications for participation in procurement.
In the autumn session at the plenary session, the state Dumas plan to consider in the second reading a bill setting out the requirements for the content and composition of the application for participation in the procurement, the participants of which can be only small and medium-sized businesses.
Amendments are made by the government to the law "On the procurement of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities".
The bill was developed in accordance with the roadmap for the implementation of the Strategy for the Development of Small and Medium-Sized Entrepreneurship in the Russian Federation until 2030, approved by the government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to request as part of the application from procurement participants - small and medium-sized enterprises.
And also - about the list of requirements for these documents.
To date, the law "On the procurement of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities" framework regulates the procurement activities of certain types of legal entities.
Requirements for the content, form, registration and composition of the application for participation in the purchase are established by customers independently in the procurement documentation.
"As a result, customers establish excessive requirements for the content, registration of the application, mandatory presence in its composition of certificates, certificates, extracts, the date of receipt of which in the authorized bodies is comparable with the deadline for submitting applications, which leads to the impossibility of participating in such a purchase and reducing the number of participants in the purchase," the explanation of the bill reads.
The new draft law provides for the establishment of an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to request as part of the application from procurement participants who are small and medium-sized enterprises.
"The adoption of the document will eliminate the arbitrary establishment by customers of requirements for the composition and content of applications of participants who are subjects of small and medium-sized enterprises," the explanatory note says.

The head of the region Igor Kobzev met with the mayors of the Ust-Ordyn Buryat district
During the workshop, which was held today, July 24, the government of the Irkutsk region discussed the main directions of the development of remote agricultural territories.
During the working trips to the districts of Ust-Ordyn Buryat district, the head of the region gave a number of instructions.
Today, the mayors reported on their performance.
First of all, the construction of the House of Sports in Ust-Orda was resumed.
The order for this facility was given by the President of the Russian Federation fourteen years ago.
But only now the situation has been able to move from a dead point.
866 million rubles will be spent on construction.
The term of delivery of the construction in 2022.
And already this year, a school in the village of Bayandai should be commissioned.
Finishing of the premises has been completed at the moment.
Of the remaining works - the improvement of the territory.
In general, the program of construction of pre-school and secondary education facilities is of particular importance for the region.
Especially for your district.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we are obliged to create all conditions for education and leisure of children of all ages, - said Acting Governor of the Irkutsk region Igor Kobzev.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to actively engage in the development of general plans for settlements.
This is one of the main conditions for the integrated development of the district.
All settlements must have established boundaries and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant facilities, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage, the head of the region stressed.
Also during the conversation, a problematic issue was raised with the reduction of milk intake from cooperatives by 30%.
This was due to the redistribution by the processing company of the purchase of milk in favor of peasant farms.
Because of this, the share of product acceptance among cooperatives has decreased.
The head of the region instructed the Acting Minister of Agriculture to go to the place, study the structure of milk sales, analyze the experience of other territories and identify options for solving the problem.

The authorities of the Moscow region told about the fate of closed landfills
In the suburbs continue to close landfills of solid household waste.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills are being modernized into modern recycling complexes.
But this option is not possible for every landfill - many of them are overgrown with dense residential buildings.
After the landfill is closed, it gets up for recultivation - the body of the landfill is covered with soils, degassing and infiltration systems are installed.
This allows you to stop the chemical processes inside the landfill, so that it does not ignite, does not emit an odor, does not poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill remains to rise useless pile among the surrounding residential buildings.
Why not make something useful out of it?
For example, in Ruza, where the reclamation of the Annino training ground was completed the other day, the authorities are considering the option of making a pile of ski slopes.
This landfill, which operated from 1976 to 2016, has grown so that it has gone beyond the boundaries of the land allocated for it.
Therefore, during the reclamation, it was necessary to buy out neighboring areas, de facto already clogged with garbage for a long time.
“Some time will pass, the landfill will “settle down”, gain a fortress, and we will think what can be done to make it useful.
Directly in the eyes is a ski resort," - told reporters the head of the Ruz district Nikolai Parfenov.
Two landfills will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources
"Torbeevo" polygons in Lyubertsy and "Timokhovo" in the Bogorodsky district will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
On the territory of "Torbeev" by the end of the year will be launched a gas-piston power plant capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy per year, which will provide its own needs of the landfill - heating of administrative and industrial premises.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste processing complex.
And a museum can be set up at the Balashikha Kuchino training ground, which was closed after residents’ complaints on the Direct Line with the country’s president.
"There was such an idea - to create a museum of reclamation of landfills near Moscow," - said Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of Ecology and Environmental Management of the region Dmitry Kurakin.

Beautiful high minarets only decorated Hagia Sophia
Once again about Aya-Sofia - the text of Fr.Vladimir Zelinsky was found, which, they say, must be protested.
First of all, there was a free entrance - hurrah!
I haven't been to Istanbul, but it's better to have free entrance to the House of God than paid entrance.
Secondly, the Muslims have conquered this land as honestly as the Orthodox have conquered the Volga-Ok inter-river, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God help us!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans have conquered America.
Are we going to give it all back?
Do you think there will be no pagans who will demand the return of their temple, in the place of which the tithe church?
Thirdly, the Muslims improved this building, invested in it.
That is, it belongs to them, just as the factories and estates that the Leninists took from the bourgeoisie as their property, belong to the Leninists, to Putin and to the rest of the nomenclature.
They have improved everything from the Kremlin to the Angara, so it’s all their right as progressors.
Beautiful high minarets very decorated Aya-Sofia, very.
There was a stupid inkhouse, there was a stupid inkhouse with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no “Islamic” and “Orthodox” civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are hypocrites who unite faith and hypocrisy.
The believer in the categories of civilization does not think.
This is the thinking of the British Foreign Office official Toynbee, a believer ashamed to think so.
A place of prayer for believers everywhere.
And always.
The believer does not pray only from where he is asked to leave - he goes to another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a follower.
We're cobblers, not eel-stones.

The decision to expand the RPL would not be supported by either UEFA or FIFA
The President of the Russian Football Union (RFU) Alexander Dyukov believes that expanding the Russian Premier League (RPL) to 18 teams is currently wrong.
