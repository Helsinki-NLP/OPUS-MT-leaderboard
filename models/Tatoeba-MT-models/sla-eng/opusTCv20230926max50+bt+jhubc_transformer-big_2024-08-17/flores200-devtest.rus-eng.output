This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widespread theory, but also provides details that are usually not obtainable from fossil remains, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown on top, and from below it was either pale or had carotenoid pigmentation.
The find also allows you to get acquainted with the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the feathers of dinosaurs lack a well-developed rod called a rickshaw, but still have other distinguishing features — beards and chins — the researchers concluded that the rickshaw most likely appeared later through the evolutionary development of other distinguishing features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation and demonstration. The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but the sample presents adult plumage, not the fluff of a chicken.
The researchers hypothesized that, despite being the tail of a young dinosaur, this specimen has the plumage of an adult individual rather than the fluff of a chicken.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of a galaxy in Sagittarius.
The effect the team was looking for could be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy’s dark matter and the Milky Way’s dark matter.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth while causing tides, so the Milky Way affects the galaxy in Sagittarius.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as in the case of ordinary matter.
According to this theory, a significant part of the dark matter around the Galaxy is located in the form of a halo and consists of a large number of small particles.

In France, voting is traditionally carried out by low-tech methods: the voter closes the booth and puts a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the selected candidate in an envelope.
After the officials certify the identity of the voter, he lowers the envelope in the ballot box and signs the list of voters.

Beginning in 1988, ballot boxes should be transparent so that voters and observers can be assured that there are no envelopes inside at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes have been added to them other than those of persons who have been admitted to vote and whose votes have been properly counted.
Candidates can send their representatives to monitor the whole process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict control in accordance with a special procedure.

Her first competition was the slalom, in the first race of which she did not reach the finish line. 36 of the 116 participants had the same result in that race.
In another race, this time in a giant slalom, she finished tenth among women in the sitting position with a combined time of 4:41.30. At 2:11.60 minutes slower than Claudia Lesh, who finished first in Austria, and at 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth Hungarian, Gy<0xC3><0xB6>ngy Dani.
Four skiers in the women’s sitting group failed to complete their races, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to take a seat in the race.
Madhya Pradesh state police returned the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: “We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman and returned her mobile phone and laptop.”
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shehar Solanki, the police chief, said the defendants had been brought before judges with closed faces.
Although there were three people inside the building at the time of the car crash, no one was injured.
The driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Paget's Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Subsequently, the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court charged Adeko with the murder of her son.
She is in custody pending indictment and trial, but any testimony can be distorted as her popularity has been widely used by the media.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and courts have found the publication of photographs to be potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, from the University of Dundee, said: “Journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line by publishing photos and other data on suspects.
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is generally responsible for the prosecution, told reporters that no further comment would be made, at least until a conviction is handed down.
The document, according to the leak, will deal with a dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to establish on the basis of those that existed before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other topics reportedly raised include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both peoples, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel requires a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PNA agrees to maintain such a presence for only five years.
The shooters who took part in the additional pest control test had to be under the close supervision of the rangers, as this test was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
As part of the partnership between NPWS and the Association of Sports Archers of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited during the hunting program of the Association of Sports Archers.
According to Mick O’Flynn, Acting Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation at the Wildlife and National Parks Service, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive training and safety briefings.
Yesterday, Martey was sworn in by a new Provisional Electoral Council (PEC), consisting of nine members.
This is Marty's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended that the previous Provisional Electoral Council resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli’s response to the mass protests against the state regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due to take place as early as 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of defective iPod devices were received, resulting in six fires and four people received minor burns.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 cases involving these devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Labor and Industry announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called “non-serious.”
In response, the ministry called the delay in Apple’s report “very regrettable.”
At 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday) there was an earthquake in Mariana.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Authority said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has stolen a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and taken Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been declared dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, as well as Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers took the place of an elderly woman, as she went to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He was trained as an obstetrician-gynecologist and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
When Liggins was working in the hospital, in his spare time he began to investigate cases of premature birth.
His research showed that if the hormone is administered, it will enhance the maturation of the baby’s lungs during fetal development.
According to Xinhua, on Wednesday, state investigators found two flight recorders or, in another way, “black boxes”.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to the Moon.
Here's what Tommy Dreamer said: "The Moon became the first Queen of Extremes. She was my first manager. The Moon passed away on the night of two moons. This is such a unique event as she is. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldast" Runnels said, "The moon was as plague-like as I was... Maybe even more plague-like... I love her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people polled in the run-up to the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard, during the 2010 federal election campaign, expressed the view that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of respondents share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to become the last monarch of Australia.
The survey found that 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe that it does not need this form of government.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to participate in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his complaints his physical form is now in doubt.
He was unable to take the drugs needed to relieve the pain, as they are banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25.
On Tuesday, it was announced that by early February, several people had confirmed the discovery using a variety of hardware and software.
Comets may have been a source of water delivery to Earth, as well as a source of organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, as comets have been colliding with Earth for a long time.
Cuomo, 53, started as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumours “political chatter and stupidity.”
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the US Federal Aviation Administration, will allow aircraft to fly on reduced routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of the old ground-based radar technology, which will allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the position of aircraft and give pilots more accurate information.
There is no additional transport to Wembley, ground trains will not stop there, in addition, there are no parking lots and intercepting parking lots on the surface.
Concerns about the lack of transport have led to speculation that the game may have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
The description of the study, published Thursday in the journal Science, talks about the emergence of a new species of birds in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) reported that due to the pairing of the endemic Darwin's finches (Geospiza fortes) with the resettled cactus finches (Geospiza conirostris), the new species evolved in only two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer.
Gold can be given any shape. It can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be braided and plaited. It can be hammered or rolled into rolls.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that sometimes it was used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books - the so-called "face manuscript".
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can make an indicator with the help of red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH is determined by the degree of saturation of hydrogen ions (H in pH) of the chemical compound under study.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons are separated (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Get a new mixture by mixing two dry powders in one container, and then with clean wet hands stick a ball out of this mixture.
The moisture on your hands will react with the top layer, which will be unusual, then a shell-like appearance will form.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
Remaining fragments of sewage systems were found in the homes of Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women washed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and almost instantly reflects it back down.
The satellite was taken into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the Earth's atmosphere to some extent distorts our light and survey.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space requires a giant rocket more than 100 feet high.
The wheel changed our world in an incredible way. The most important thing that the wheel did for us was to give us much easier and faster transportation.
It gave us a train, a car and many other vehicles.
Below them are a larger number of medium-sized cats that eat small-sized prey from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including walking domestic cats) eat and hunt much more numerous small animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the concept of a niche, a special job that each species of cat does, which keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
The pride consists of from one to three adult males who are related, as well as females and cubs, the number of which can reach up to thirty.
Females are usually related to each other and make up a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave very similar to packs of wolves or dogs – animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) and are also very dangerous to their victims.
Being a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb trees (though not very well), swim, jump long distances and pull with the strength of five strong people.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthers) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who have the ability to growl.
The tiger’s roar is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but more like shouting sentences from unintelligible words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If there is a chance, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals on which the ocelot hunts are much smaller than him.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow the trail of animals and find prey by smell, tracking through the smell of its movement on the ground.
They can see perfectly in the dark with night vision and move almost imperceptibly. Ocelots track prey, merging with the surrounding environment, and then rush to prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from that in which they were previously.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or changes than those it had before to become a strong rival.
The original population has not changed at all – it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to a new environment, it begins to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Over time, thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that it cannot be said that they are the same species.
We call this process the formation of species, that is, the emergence of new species. The formation of species is a mandatory consequence and an extremely essential part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants feed on the sun by photosynthesis. In addition, they cast a shadow.
We build our houses and make clothes from plants. Most of our food is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
The mosasaur was the most formidable predator of his time, so he was not afraid of anyone but other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were studded with more than 70 sharpest teeth, and there was an extra row on the sky, so that those who met in his path could not be saved.
We do not know for sure, but it is not excluded that his tongue was bifurcated. He fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and could also be a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus would not compare to him.
Despite the fact that most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans still had their own strange and unusual dishes served during feasts. For example, boar, peacock, snails and such a kind of rodent as a sonia.
There was another difference: while the poor and the woman ate, sitting on chairs, the rich liked to arrange joint feasts, during which they ate, lying on their sides.
The diet of the ancient Romans could not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in the following centuries.
In particular, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built each of the gods according to the main sanctuary, which was considered the dwelling of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to please the wishes of the gods in ceremonies and celebrations.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only priests could enter.
Sometimes as elements of the temple built special towers in the form of pyramids called "ziggurats".
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house did not matter much.
Most of the life of a Jewish family was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were open counters, facing the street. For the construction of houses used stone.
There were no large forests on the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland for murder, and, moving further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it a name.
But regardless of its discovery, at that time there were already living tribes of Eskimos.
Although each country was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the peoples, rulers, traditions, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie “Treasure of the Nation,” you might think that the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence featured a treasure map.
Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence it is written: "This Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776." The text is written at the bottom of the document and upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence this large parchment document (the size of 293<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 by 241<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches) was folded for easier storage.
Thus, it is likely that the entry was added simply as a markup.
As a result of Operation Neptune and subsequent battles, the north of France was liberated, but the south was still not liberated.
It was under the control of the Vichy French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of opposing them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded the south of France. The invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the forces of Free France and the Americans liberated southern France and marched towards Germany.
Civilization is a separate culture, the carriers of which are a fairly large group of people living and working together, society.
The word “civilization” comes from the Latin civilis, meaning “civilian” and is a relative of the Latin words civis, meaning “citizen,” and civitas, meaning “city” or “city-state,” and it also expresses the size of society in a certain way.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transfer of knowledge through several generations, an unceasing cultural presence and a continuous dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, thirteen states, in accordance with the Articles of Confederation, for the first time formed a weak central government, the only organ of which was Congress.
Congress lacked any authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on the power of the states, which often refused to cooperate and did not want to enforce all of its acts.
He also did not have the authority to repeal tax laws and state tariffs.
The amendments required unanimous approval by all states, but the states were so irresponsible with the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions. Residents of Italy from these regions participate in international competitions and Olympiads.
There are approximately 7,000 islands in Japan (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
By virtue of belonging to a cluster/group of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an archipelago.
Taiwan dates back many years, to the 15th century, when European navigators passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of indigenous grain production methods and hiring Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded the rights to Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Windows Room.
Most of the buildings along the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of what they looked like initially.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored. Restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the world's most common format for static photos is 35 mm, and it was this size that was the dominant film size at the end of the analog era.
Today, it is still produced, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has inherited the size of digital camera images.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusing, it has a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The ratio of the sides of this format (divided by twelve to get the ratio with small integers) is therefore taken to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats) are equal or close to these proportions.
Too often used and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple recommendation that creates dynamism, while maintaining a certain proportion of order in the image.
It states that it is best to place the main object at the intersection of lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and strong, was the object of close attention.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united European states despite differences in languages and traditions.
Her all-pervading power touched everyone, from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the money of the church exists for this very purpose.
The center of church power has been based in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth has led many to question whether this dogma is being upheld.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
The strategy has proved effective by cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade has violated universally accepted international laws set out in several international agreements over the past two hundred years.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sectors of the oceans, endangering even neutral vessels.
Since the reaction to this tactic was restrained, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unhindered submarine warfare.
Among the majority of citizens and peoples in the 1920s, such sentiments as pacifism and isolation prevailed.
Having known the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the states wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted an offer to work for Edison in New York City.
He came to the U.S. with four cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, who had been his supervisor on his previous job, to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, a unique way was used to designate periods of time; each stage of China or each family in power was a separate dynasty.
In addition, between the reigns of each dynasty there was fragmentation and instability. The most famous was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years during the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there were fierce hostilities between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The era of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for a place on the throne in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to the sole ruler.
Also after the Revolution, job opportunities opened up for all men, which allowed the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same applies to the army, because the ranks began to be based on qualities, and not depending on origin.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressive representatives of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in topics unrelated to worldly life. He often visited the cave, which became known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (light) for reflection.
Well, the cave, which has survived to this day, very clearly gives us an idea of the spiritual aspirations of Muhammad.
The cave is located at the top of the mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It is very difficult to detect even for someone who knows about its existence. In the cave, a person finds himself in complete isolation.
You can see nothing but a clear, beautiful sky above your head and many surrounding mountains. From the depths of the cave you can see and hear only a very small part of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that exists today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the memory of the pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis, in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of the wives of Cheops and his relatives.
The sign of the upward movement of the bow looks like a V, and the downward movement of the bow is like a bracket or square without the underside.
“Up” means you have to start with the tip and pull the bow forward, and “down” means you have to start from where your hand holds the bow and pull it back.
The upward movement of the bow usually produces a softer sound, while the downward movement of the bow is stronger and more assertive.
You can draw your own hatch, but remember that the hatch is printed for musical reasons, and it’s usually worth following.
On October 6, 1789, an angry mob of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister Elizabeth to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted threats to the king and queen.
A crowd of people forced the King and Queen to open the windows wide.
At one point, a member of this crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The military expenses of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to pay most of the costs and interest on bond loans moved on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking offices.
Of course, the super-profits brought by the long exploitation of the Filipinos were the main income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context that prompted them to create the Order.
The era in which these events took place is called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history affecting the XI, XII and XIII centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages replaced the earlier Middle Ages and preceded the late Middle Ages, which, according to the accepted view, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term covering a wide range of practical ideas, from technological progress or technological imperative to the strict point of view that the fates of people are driven by the fundamental logic associated with the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most views on technological determinism share two general ideas: that the direction of technology development is virtually unaffected by cultural or political influence, and that, in turn, the "impact" of technology on society is due to their own properties, not to society.
For example, one could say that the car is a mandatory reason for the development of roads.
However, the nationwide road network is economically unprofitable only for a small group of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in the number of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new methods of treating injuries in health care.
Romanticism largely involved cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography formed people, and over time, related customs and culture arose, which, being in harmony with the place of residence of a given society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the capital of fashion in the times of feudal Europe.
The fame of it as a center of luxury went around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined throughout the twelfth century mainly due to the Crusaders returning with gifts such as silk and spices valued higher than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
At this point, the title of the Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style flourished between the 10th and 11th centuries.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west can lag by 25-30 years.
Own styles began to develop in Western Europe by the end of the Middle Ages. One of the greatest achievements of that time, thanks to the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
Natural agriculture is agriculture that produces enough food to meet the needs of only the farmer and his/her family.
Natural agriculture is a simple, often organic, system of agriculture that uses the seeds of plants growing in a given ecosystem, along with the use of crop rotation and other relatively simple methods of increasing yields.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in agriculture for the purpose of food, and this is still observed in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel violated by the standards of society, and allow such people to determine for themselves who they are.
Subcultures may vary according to the age, nationality, social status, place of residence and/or gender of the people they comprise.
Characteristics that define a subculture as separate may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Representatives of a certain subculture often declare their belonging through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, including fashion, manners and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to illustrate a few unfortunate cases in which children, due to lack of proper attention, unfortunate circumstances, or intentional abuse, have not been in contact with adults during their growing up.
Such children are called "wild" or "wild". Some wild children were isolated by people (usually their own parents). In some cases, such a rejection of their child was the result of parents not accepting his serious intellectual or physical disability.
Children living on the streets may have experienced severe forms of violence or trauma before fleeing or being abandoned.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some of them lived in the wild on their own.
If he is completely raised by animals instead of humans, the wild child exhibits habits (within physical limitations) in almost everything similar to the specific animal that raised him – for example, his fear or indifference to people.
While project-based learning should be simpler and more interesting, scaffolding is ahead of many technologies.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a form of helping those who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of Scaffolding, but it is also a Scaffolder in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolding, which helps in learning, is built into the software and is designed to remind, explain and ask questions about procedures that the learner might find too difficult to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, from homelessness to abuse and even extortion.
Children should never grow up in an environment where there is no education, care and education, but they are growing.
We believe the foster care system is safe for children.
Our care system should provide safe housing, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Patronage education should provide all the needs that were missing in the house, from where they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communications.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to an additional scale in terms of use and satisfaction.
Thus, it has been suggested that “learning” and “socialization” are important motivating factors for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "long-term contacts" were also named by Aimee and McCord (1998) as new facets of motivation when they studied how people respond to websites.
The use of video led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions - facial movements lasting several milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying by the correct interpretation of his microexpressions.
In his article “The President’s Speech,” Oliver Sachs described how people who, due to brain damage, are unable to understand speech, can nevertheless correctly assess the sincerity of the speaker.
According to his assumption, such abilities in the interpretation of human behavior can have animals, for example, domestic dogs.
Studies conducted in the twentieth century have shown that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation introduces a new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the set of manifested variations.
Segregation and recombination with each generation shuffle variations between the two pools.
In the savannah, primates with a digestive system such as that of humans find it difficult to meet their amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so will lead to such serious consequences as a slowdown in growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most accessible plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are poorly digested by primates like us if they are not cooked.
On the contrary, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also represents a rich source of proteins containing all the main amino acids.
Given all of the above, it is not surprising that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in much the same way as it is solved by chimpanzees in the savanna to this day.
Sleep interruption is the process of purposeful awakening during normal sleep and falling asleep again after a short time (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done with the help of a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself reinstalling your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will make you get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options that are based on biological rhythms include taking fluids in large amounts (in particular, water or tea, a known diuretic) before going to bed, which causes a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace of a person is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present in you. Each person is potentially given absolute peace and a sense of satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was supplemented by the Mahayana way of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-consuming love.
The energy of kundalini (enlightenment energy) in kundalini yoga is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is considered to be the Yoga of Deities. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleaned, chakras are launched and enlightenment of consciousness is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. After the end of the war, contradictions regarding the system, process and culture led to discord between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and it was fought in earnest, using proxy armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other parts of the world.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had already been broken, and the only hope was a retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became irrelevant almost overnight, when about 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the capture of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Agreement, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way of transporting large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
Seafarers traditionally work to ensure the ability of a country to move its people and goods, while at the same time hindering the enemy’s ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this was a company in the North Atlantic during World War II. The Americans tried to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly its submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the anti-Hitler coalition had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Iranian Zagros Mountains.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to leave them to themselves to have milk, wool, meat and skin on hand.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often watched over by goatherds, which were usually children or adolescents, which is similar to the more common activities of a shepherd. These grazing methods are still used today.
Roads for carriages were built in England in the 16th century.
Although the horse-drawn roads were only parallel timber bars, they allowed horses to carry larger loads and at a higher speed than the slightly more bumpy roads of the time.
Sleepers began to be used quite a long time ago in order to hold the rails in place. However, it later became clear that the paths were more effective with an iron strip on top.
This became a common practice, but iron led to more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron appeared.
The first known form of transportation was leg movement, people began to walk right two million years ago with the advent of Homo Erectus (which means a straight man).
For their ancestors, the Australopithecines were not so accustomed to straight walking.
Bipedal specializations are found in the remains of Australopithecus from the era of 4.2–3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living with more concern for the environment. We can become members of the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to at least alleviate further suffering.
Usually, it's like treating a symptom. If we don't just need a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problem and fix it.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot under the influence of scientific and technological progress of mankind, and due to overpopulation and extravagant way of life of people the problems have become more extensive.
Following congressional approval on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress Chairman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing workshop.
150–200 copies were made overnight, now known as the Dunlap Leaflets.
The first public reading of this document was made by John Nixon at Independence Hall on July 8.
On 6 July, a copy was sent to George Washington, who on 9 July ordered it read to his troops in New York.
The 25 Dunlap leaflets known to date are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not reach us.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one of the groups of dinosaurs survived and survived to the present day. We call them birds.
They are often not considered dinosaurs because they have feathers and are able to fly.
But there’s still a lot to be said about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the processing of information, which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1. These numbers are called "binary numbers" - or "bits" if you use computer jargon.
It can be difficult to detect oral poisoning right away. Symptoms such as vomiting are too common for a quick diagnosis.
The best sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container with a medicine or a toxic household chemical.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for poisoning with this particular poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists formally to refer to a group of insects.
This concept comes from bed bugs known since ancient times - insects, perfectly adapted to parasitizing on humans.
Both predators and bed bugs are nesting species adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) have been identified, making MS the leading neurological disease of young and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that MS affects twice as many women as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or their child’s best interest.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
When adopted or adopted, biological parents waive their parental rights so that another couple can adopt a child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works by applying the scientific method. This method is actually the basis of most scientific research.
It is, however, not the only one. Scientific research is also driven by experimentation (an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses), asking questions, and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused their attention on ancient texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
In all scientific questions, including psychology, Aristotle's views were adopted.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend heavily on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply a reaction to external periodic stimuli, are recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue to be autonomous for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase’s experiment was one of the first to suggest that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their DNA into the bacterium using phages, or viruses.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus and the phage's radioactive gray protein.
Mutations can produce a wide variety of outcomes, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the mutated cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism is interesting for those who like to ride on nature to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and plants.
Examples of active recreation at the facility include hunting, fishing, photographing, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the countryside to go to their place of work, and pass by those whose place of work is in the place from which they have just left.
In this active traffic, everyone is connected in one way or another with the transport system based on personal cars, and supports it.
Currently, science indicates that a huge hydrocarbon economy has affected one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported the evolution of mankind over the past two million years.
Everyone is a member of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about these systems.
In developed countries, you can rarely hear such complaints about water quality or falling bridges.
Why do transport systems receive so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or are there more fundamental reasons for this?
The study of the movement of individual drivers and cars between two points and their interaction with each other is carried out as part of the study of traffic flows.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the intensity of traffic, because it is impossible to predict the behavior of the driver with a hundred percent probability.
Fortunately, drivers’ behavior is often quite systematic; thus, traffic flows generally have some systematicity and can be approximated mathematically.
To better represent the transport flow, relationships were established between the three basic quantities: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of railway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to rise into the air. Their ability to fly helped them to easily escape from enemies, find food and partners.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along the body, which gives them an advantage.
This gives them more secluded places to hide from predators.
The dragonflies and scabbards are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Many believed he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
That seems like a reasonable idea because we don’t feel the Earth moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the first largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times more water, compared to the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water coming from our planet’s rivers into the oceans flows from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles). Thousands of small rivers flow into it.
Despite the fact that the construction of the pyramids of stone continued until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the pyramids at Giza could not be surpassed.
In the new kingdom, the ancient Egyptians admired the monuments created by their predecessors more than a thousand years ago.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, as well as the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses the Italian language in legislation and official communications.
Italian is also an everyday language for most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All Vatican citizens are Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, as they can all be found in nature in pure form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire.
They were similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also assumed that they transitioned into a new state to produce what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
It is also possible to make alloys that contain a small amount of such non-metallic elements as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them can fit at the point at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil became a good friend for many people when it appeared.
It is sad that when new ways of writing appeared, the pencil lost its former status and began to use it less.
Now people write messages on computer screens, and they never have to deal with a sharpener.
One can only guess what will happen with the keyboard, with the advent of newer technologies.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that in order for many protons and neutrons to be in the same nucleus, energy is needed.
It's kind of like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, and then re-splitting the core releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they tend to decay with little or no impact.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick under the oceans and 100 km thick under the continents.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more lunar seas on the visible side, because the crust is thinner there. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people act or what might interest them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that build up within them as they grow up.
These theories address what makes specific people want to do what they do, and what makes their environment do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow’s Needs Pyramid and Herzberg’s Two-Factor Theory of Motivation.
As a rule, there can be two types of behavior when managers begin to lead people previously equal in status. One extreme of the spectrum is an attempt to remain "your boyfriend" (or girlfriend).
Such managers find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary action, evaluate performance, allocate responsibilities and hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels he must change everything the team has done and appropriate it to himself.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same skill standards as regular teams, but there are small differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They are usually more autonomous than employees from traditional teams, because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which can not always be understood by the local leadership.
Having a real “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"Invisible team" is a team of managers to which each participant reports. The invisible team sets the norms for each participant.
Why do organizations go through the laborious process of creating a self-learning organization? One of the goals of applying the concepts of self-learning organizations in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used in all functional units of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can manifest.
As a result, the united work of the organization in order to overcome the obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that will meet the interests of the client.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of efficiency.
Neuroscience data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of consciousness. Thus, the field of study is narrowed, and it becomes much more accurate.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is used by scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen structures and processes of the brain.
This provides us with a large amount of data and materials to create simulation models that help us understand the processes taking place in our minds.
Despite the fact that AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it forms a very important area of computer science, which considers the behavior and training of machines and their “instillation” of intelligence.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Here are some of the examples that can be cited: control, planning and scheduling, responding to diagnoses and client questions, as well as face, handwriting and voice recognition.
Such questions are highlighted in separate disciplines, the purpose of which is to solve problems that we face in everyday life.
Nowadays, the AI system is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military sphere, being embedded in some software applications for home computers and video games.
Study tours are very important for any class. Very often, teachers want to take their students where they can not get by bus.
The technology offers a solution with the help of virtual tours. Students can view the museum exhibits, visit the aquarium or enjoy the beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Laying out a tour in a virtual space for general viewing is also a great way to refresh the tour’s memory and share your gained knowledge with future classes.
For example, every year students of Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their visit to the state capital, and every year this site is updated, but access to the old versions is still maintained - they serve as a commemorative album.
Blogs can also improve students’ writing skills. Although students often start their blog using sloppy grammar and spelling, this tends to change due to the presence of an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to strive to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
Also, while blogging, "students begin to understand the world better." Students are inspired to be smart and interesting, attracting the attention of readers (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a collaborative tool, and it motivates students to extend the learning process far beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can give students the opportunity to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to online materials, students can determine their position in the context of other people's work, as well as state their own views on specific issues (Oravek, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming bilingual capital of Canada with a huge number of art galleries and museums that reveal the past and present of Canada.
Further south, Niagara Falls is located, and the north is the patrimony of Muskoka’s untouched natural beauty and the surrounding areas.
All this and much more makes Ontario something truly Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
Large areas further north are rarely inhabited, and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A surprising population comparison: There are more African Americans in the U.S. than there are citizens in Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is much larger than the rest and is a distinctive continent in terms of wildlife.
Almost all of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, especially its roots in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The spread of European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama opened the way through the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: All tourists are advised to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (only not too expensive in appearance).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may make them feel that they are being harassed, often harassed, taken by the hand, and so on.
Firmly refuse men and do not be afraid to stand on their own (this is unacceptable regardless of cultural differences!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C. It was used by the Romans, Phoenicians and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city under the name of Ed Dar el Beida, and the Spanish merchants who created trading bases here called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old medina it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as bags, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a whole range of all sorts of trinkets, but all this for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city streets, especially the central part of the city.
Although Goma is a fairly safe place, information about any trips outside Goma should be clarified in advance in order to understand the state of combat operations in the province of North Kivu.
This city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, and here you can also see mountain gorillas in the wild at one of the cheapest prices in Africa.
You can go to Goma for a boda boda (mototaxi). The usual (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for the exotic faraway land.
Today, Timbuktu is a impoverished city, but its reputation attracts tourists here, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the World Heritage List, which is under threat because of the danger from the sands of the desert.
While filming the Henry Louis Gates show “Wonders of the African World” on the PBS channel, one of the most important stops was made here.
This city is very different from other cities in the country, as it is dominated by Arab color, not African.
Kruger National Park is located in northeastern South Africa, along the border with Mozambique in the east, with Zimbabwe in the north, its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The area of the park is 19,500 km2; it has 14 different ecozones, each of which is a habitat for different wild animals.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the leading among South African national parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there is a daily fee for its protection and visit.
It can also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card, which allows you to visit the national parks of South Africa either selectively or all.
The territory of Hong Kong was named after the island of Hong Kong, a place that many tourists consider the main object of their attention.
The range of buildings forming Hong Kong’s skyline is compared to a glittering bar chart highlighted by the water of Victoria Bay.
To see the most picturesque places of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head to the coast of the Jiulong Peninsula, which is opposite.
Most of the urban development areas of Hong Kong Island are closely focused on the land reclaimed by the sea on the north coast.
It’s a place that the British colonizers took for themselves, and if you’re looking for evidence of the territory’s colonial past, then it’s a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest belt of coastal mangroves, extending 80 km (50 mi) from shore into the interior of the continent in Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps – they also include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which about a third is covered by water or swamps.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and is estimated to be home to 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (behind the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumtang, depart from 06:30 to 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often crowded, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, comfortable and reliable.
The shuttle is a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The bridge across the Ojapoque River is a cable-stayed bridge. It extends across the Ojapoque River and connects the cities of Ojapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Ojapoque in French Guiana.
These two towers reach 83 meters in height, and the bridge itself is 378 meters long and has two lanes of traffic 3.5 meters wide.
The height of the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
Guarini were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the area now occupied by eastern Paraguay, they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region served as a home for various groups of local tribes, for example, for Guaycuru and Pajagua, they survived through hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as the “great province of the East Indies,” emerged from a clash of Spanish conquerors with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci<0xC3><0xB3>n in 1537, Paraguay has largely managed to retain much of its distinctive character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams, as well as the best players in the world in such a sport as polo.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches here can also be seen at other times of the year.
To learn more about polo matches and where to buy tickets for them, visit the website of the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the value of which is equivalent to the value of one British pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on these islands, which is located on Port Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
As a rule, British pounds will be accepted everywhere on the islands. In Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
In remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; clarify with the owners in advance which payment method is acceptable.
The currency of the Falkland Islands is almost impossible to exchange outside of them, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, there is summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, the air temperature above +30 ° C is a common phenomenon.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity creates a feeling of colder weather compared to what the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of precipitation is approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, nature is still wild, so there is no need to feed or disturb the animals.
The park administration warns: do not approach more than 100 yards / meters to bears and wolves, as well as more than 25 yards / meters to all other wild animals!
No matter how calm they look, bison, moose, bears, and virtually all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they do not observe the required distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so observe their personal space.
In addition, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid cooking or carrying fragrant food with you, as well as maintaining cleanliness in the camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the bay.
All the ships sank, except for one British cruiser, killing about 200 American and German sailors.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the assassination of supreme leader Tupua Tamsese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches here, as Auckland is located on the shores of two harbors. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbor area) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these beaches are sandy with safe swimming, and many of them are shady thanks to trees like pohutukawa.
In the central area of Auckland, where the prestigious residential suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers are located in Whitemath Bay, the Tamaki Drive beaches are located.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops located along the coast. Swim safely.
The most popular local beer is "Number One", it has an uncomplicated, pleasant and refreshing taste. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are plenty of French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines can be better transported.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are still afraid, it will not be difficult to find bottled water.
Australians do not understand the idea of "flat white". "Little black" is an espresso, they serve cappuccino with a high layer of whipped cream (not with foam), and tea without milk.
Hot chocolate meets the standards of Belgium. Although fruit juices are expensive, they have excellent quality.
There is a large number of trips to the reef all year round, and injuries caused by any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the recommendations of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cubomedusa is found near beaches and river mouths north of 1770 from October to April. Sometimes they can be found outside this period.
Sharks do exist, but rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Rowing crocodiles do not lead an active life in the ocean, and their main habitat is the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Pre-booking allows the traveler not to worry about where to spend the night on arrival at the destination.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, but you can book through a travel agent and other forms of accommodation, such as camping sites.
Travel agents usually sell packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined packages that include flight and hotel accommodation.
In addition, they can save your booking if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for the destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests should be addressed to the travel agency first, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants spend the night directly on the festival grounds, and most of them consider it a mandatory part of the program.
If you want to be near the stage, you need to arrive in advance to find a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages may already be over, there may be areas at the festival where they will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, find out about the location of the cabin, as the passage on the ice leads to a rather eerie noise that can interfere with the sleep of the most sensitive people.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include walks around the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (specify the conditions).
Usually casinos make every effort to ensure that visitors spend as much time as possible and spend as much money as possible in the institution. There are no windows and clocks there, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks and entertainment so that guests stay in a good mood and do not leave the establishment.
Some establishments offer free alcohol. However, intoxication fogs the mind, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who is going to drive in a high-latitude area or on mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or frost.
On an icy and snowy road, friction is low, and you won’t be able to drive a car in the same way as on a regular asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow to get stuck can fall in a very short period of time.
Visibility may also be restricted due to snowfall, blizzards, condensate or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice weather conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues year-round almost without interruption.
Safari is probably the biggest lure for tourists in Africa and the main event for many travelers.
The term safari in everyday use means a land trip to see the striking wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, often approach machines, so with conventional equipment you can get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes cautious, and you’ll want to consider them better through binoculars.
A walking safari (also referred to as a "scrub study", a "hiking safari" or a "walking tour") consists of a hike lasting from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in different locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, first held here in 1964.
If you booked tickets and accommodation for 2020 before the date was announced, you may have a difficult situation.
The cancellation rules may vary, but as of the end of March, most of the coronavirus-related rules do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a standard ticket price of around 7,000 yen.
Smoothing wet clothes helps it dry. Many hotels provide rental irons and ironing boards, even if they are not in the room.
If there’s no iron at hand or you’re not thrilled with the idea of wearing ironed socks, you can try the hair dryer if there is one.
Do not expose the tissue to too high a temperature (which can cause shrinkage or, in very rare cases, burn).
There are different ways to clean water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it will take several minutes.
Filters are effective in different ways, and in case of doubt, you should think about buying water in sealed bottles and from a trustworthy company.
Travelers can meet with pest animals that they have not seen in their native lands.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, release poison, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can cause damage or death are generally not considered pests.
Shopping "duty-free" is an opportunity to buy goods at certain points without taxes and excises.
Travelers traveling to high-tax countries can sometimes save a significant amount, especially on goods such as spirits and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fermon has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated wilderness and woodland.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, beware: steep slopes, narrow alleys and sharp turns predominate.
The speed limits set are noticeably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections – usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than the rest.
However, strangely enough, the mobile phone connection here is much better than on many other sections of the route, for example, in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is quite good. In Bavaria, it is very abundant and diverse and similar to the pastry of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit baking is common, baking with apples is all year round, and cherries and plums appear in the summer.
German pastries often use almonds, hazelnuts and other tree nuts. Often popular cakes are perfectly combined with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but hearty flour confectionery, try something that, depending on the region, is called filling pancakes or donuts.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the fluid content, the curry may be "dry" or "wet".

Indonesian cuisine, with 17,000 islands to choose from, is a generic term used to refer to the huge variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But without clarification, this term most often implies food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, today widespread throughout the archipelago, includes a range of unpretentiously spiced dishes. The most preferred Javanese flavorings are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are the rider’s footrests hanging from both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with better stability, but there may be safety issues, as there is a chance of the foot getting stuck.
If the horse has dropped the rider, but his leg is stuck in the stirrup, the running horse can drag it behind him. To minimize this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel that have a smooth and rather thin sole.
In addition, individual saddles, especially English, are equipped with safety arcs, thanks to which the leather stirrup falls off the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamo Valley is the main destination in Chile for mountaineering. It is known as Yosmit of South America and has a large number of large granite walls and rocks.
At the top you can enjoy stunning mountain scenery. Rock climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes in its huge potential for mountaineering.
Mountain winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve skiing or snowboarding down snow-capped terrain on foot-mounted skis or snowboards.
Mountain skiing is the main tourist destination for many ski lovers (they are also sometimes called "ski bums"), planning a holiday entirely around skiing in a certain place.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first entertainment ski club in Australia.
Ski tourismThis activity is also called backcountry, skituro or skiing.
This is related to, but usually does not include hiking to the top and then going down the unprepared slopes, as riding on virgin land requires tougher skis and boots.
Imagine that a ski route is a walking route.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover several longer distances than when moving on foot, but you can develop this speed on cross-country skiing only in extremely rare cases when you do not have a heavy backpack and there is a ski slope.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but there are many independent states on it. In normal circumstances, traveling through many countries would mean the need to apply for a visa and repeatedly pass passport control.
But the Schengen area in this regard functions as a single country.
While in this zone, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control points again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to each of the Schengen countries separately, which will save you time and money, as well as avoid paper red tape.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured products are antiques. Some tax authorities define goods that are over 100 years old as antiques.
This concept has geographical varieties in which the age limit in places like North America may be less than in Europe.
Crafts can be defined as antiques, despite the fact that by age they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the surrounding culture is also important for many other professions.
Although this is a tradition, not all representatives of the Sami people were engaged in the mass breeding of deer; they lived fishing, hunting and other similar crafts, using deer mainly as pack animals.
Today, many Sami are engaged in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region of Lapland.
Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Gypsies, it is often considered offensive because of associations associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma people.
If the country you’re going to visit is covered by travel advice that warns you of the dangers of their visit, it could affect your health insurance during the trip or your travel cancellation insurance.

Here is an example: U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face situations that Europeans or Arabs cannot face.
The news reports only briefly describe the political situation in one country.
The opinions expressed are often superficial, vague, and oversimplified in comparison to the more detailed information available everywhere.
Unfavorable weather conditions are a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause any damage, cause serious social upheaval, or result in human casualties.

Regional and seasonal weather hazards include blizzards, snowstorms, ice and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to take into account any risks associated with the harsh weather in their area as they can affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should receive training.
A search on the Internet for the phrase “security course in a hostile environment” may give the address of a local company.
The course usually deals in much more detail with all the topics covered here, most often with training in practice.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes playing situations, a large amount of information on first aid and sometimes training with weapons.
Books and magazines that talk about surviving in the wild are common, but there are few publications about combat zones.
People planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should make sure they have valid documents with them for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without specifying the gender (X) or documents updated according to the desired name and gender is different in different places.

Inspections at checkpoints have also become much more intensive since the events of 11 September 2001.
Transgenders preparing for surgery should not be expected to be able to pass through scanners without their privacy and dignity being affected.
A rip current is a current created by waves that break against a shore, or sometimes a reef, or something like that.
The reverse flow is concentrated in several deeper areas where a rapid current can form to a greater depth, due to a similar underwater topology.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue when trying to swim back upstream, which may not be possible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back will not be more difficult than usual.
Try to go where you won’t get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you’ve been spotted, you might want to wait for rescue.
The shock of returning to your home country comes earlier than the culture shock (there is a shorter romantic period), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily get used to a new culture can sometimes find it particularly difficult to re-accustom to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you are adapted to a new culture and have lost some of the habits of your native culture.
When you first went abroad, people most likely treated you with patience and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adapt in a new country.
It may come as a surprise to people that patience and understanding need to be shown to travelers returning home as well.
The sound and light show against the background of the pyramid is one of the most interesting events in this area for children.
The pyramids can be seen in the dark, and you can also see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually there is always a noise from tourists and sellers. The history of sound and light is like a book with stories.
The Sphinx acts as the background and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
Several countries claim to have discovered the South Shetland Islands in 1819. These islands have the most bases and in 2020 sixteen were active.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers from the peninsula. The largest island is named after King George with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Decepticon Island, where the submerged caldera of the active volcano is an impressive natural harbor.
The Land of Ellsworth is an area south of the Antarctic Peninsula, washed by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of this peninsula here merge with the plateau, and then rise again to form the 360-kilometer mountain system of Elsworth, divided by the Minnesota glacier in two parts.
In the northern part, that is, on the Sentinel ridge, there are the highest mountains of Antarctica - the Vinson massif, the highest point of which reaches 4892 m and is called Vinson Peak.
In remote locations outside the mobile coverage area, a satellite phone may be your only option.
As a rule, a satellite phone is not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside in the line of sight from the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, including pleasure and high-speed vessels, where there is a need for remote data transmission and voice communication.
As a rule, you will be able to get more information about connecting this service by contacting your local telephone operator.
An option that is becoming increasingly popular for those who plan to take the academic year is to travel and study.
This is especially popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a year off before entering university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in any course abroad during your academic vacation can really increase your chances of enrolling in higher education institutions in your home country.
As a rule, when applying for such educational programs, a tuition fee is charged.
Finland is a great place for boating tourism. In the "land of a thousand lakes" there are also thousands of islands on lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
Exploring the archipelago or visiting the lakes, you can do without a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes can really accommodate any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks leave a completely different impression.
Boating is the national form of leisure in Finland. In particular, for seven or eight people there is one boat.
The situation is similar for Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in other cases it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands this value is from one to forty).
Most of the individual Baltic cruises include extended parking in the Russian St. Petersburg.
This means that you can spend a few full days in this historic city, and overnight – return to the ship.
If you go ashore only in the order of a boat excursion, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures show Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be frightening for a person of any age and social status, especially if it is his first flight in life or if he has had any traumatic event in the past.
It is not worth being ashamed of it: it is no different from personal hostility and fear of other things that a lot of people have.
Understanding how a plane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear that comes from not knowing or not being able to control the process.
Delivery services are well paid for fast delivery. Often, the speed of delivery of commercial documentation, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs is very important.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies, this was a problem.
If they were shipping anything as air cargo, on some routes unloading and customs passage could take several days.
The only way to deal with it faster is to send it as checked baggage. The rules of the airline do not allow you to send luggage without a passenger, so here you need your participation.
The most obvious way to fly in first or business class is to fork over that privilege (or, better yet, make your company pay for you).
However, this is quite expensive – according to experience in rough approximation, you will pay four times more than the usual economy class for business and eleven times more for the first class!
As a rule, it makes no sense to even look for discounts on business class or first class for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a tidy sum for the privilege of getting anywhere quickly and comfortably, which is why they charge an appropriate fee.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has fallen victim to ethnic conflict.

The inhospitable appearance of Parisians will immediately evaporate, you should show a little elementary courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mostly beech, spruce and fir trees, and is a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the combination of microclimates, different soils and elevation differences, it presents a particularly wide variety of plant communities.
The area abounds with a huge number of different species of animals and birds.
Here you can find rare representatives of the fauna, for example, the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and dandelion, as well as many other common species of animals.
When visiting monasteries, women should be dressed in skirts below the knee and with their shoulders covered.
In most monasteries, women who came unprepared are given dressing gowns, but if you take your own, especially bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men should wear pants that would cover their knees.
They can also be taken at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each use, so you may be uncomfortable in these skirts. One size fits all men!

Ancient observatories are generally considered obsolete today and serve as museums or educational institutions.
Since light pollution during their heyday was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses that are easier to reach than those built in our time.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote places with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Contemplation of sakura flowering, called "hanami", entered Japanese culture as early as the 8th century.
This idea came from China, where the favorite flower was plum color.
In Japan, the first celebrations of cherry blossoms were arranged by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural habitat, so do not give in to the temptation to take at least one copy.
When you visit an officially organized garden, collecting "samples" will also lead to the fact that you will be expelled without any talk.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to navigate, and almost anything can be bought upon arrival.
But, being in the "deep tropics" only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to cope with both heat (constantly) and strong sun (in cloudless skies, less often).

All the animals that originally arrived on these islands, got here by swimming, flew or were killed by the current.
Because of the great distance from the continent, mammals could not get there, which makes the giant tortoise the main herbivorous animal in the Galapagos Islands.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will learn what polar night is when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the northern lights, because the sky will be more or less dark around the clock.
Since these areas are sparsely populated, and as a result, light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
