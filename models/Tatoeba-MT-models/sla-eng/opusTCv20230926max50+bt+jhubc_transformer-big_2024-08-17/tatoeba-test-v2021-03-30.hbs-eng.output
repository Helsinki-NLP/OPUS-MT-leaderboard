She hesitated for a moment.
Could it be done?
I live in Istanbul.

I want us to be more than friends.
Can you explain it to me?
I bought some groceries.
All things come to an end.
You just saved me a lot of time.
I wouldn't hurt them.
It was so cold that his teeth were clenched.
- What's your name?
Where's your dog?
This is the beginning of a new era.
Sam was Layla's dance partner.
A little birdie told me.
Can I take you home?
Tom has his reasons.
Tom said he needed my help.
Without a doubt.
Just tell Tom I called.
We could use some help.
It was love at first sight.
Stand up.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom's still frustrated.
I'd like to buy a dog.
Tom made it clear he wasn't going to do it.

This is useful information.
Sit still for a second.
I shouldn't have taken that off.
Tell me what you wrote.
“Learn from your mistakes” and “Experience is the best teacher,” they say, but in the long run even the best teacher gets angry if he or she has too much to teach in too little time.
Deal the cards, Tom.
I agree with what you wrote.
There's almost no violence in this town.
They already have one.
There's really no need to do that.
Is your watch accurate?
I hope it's dry weather.
Could you take a look and see if there's enough bread for our lunches the next day?
At least 50 passengers were killed.
It wasn't my fault.
I know him well.
Are they in love?

I know everything.
How could I resist?
I bought a lot of stuff.
I'm just not very happy.
Let me see you, Tom.
There is no rule without exception.
It's hard for me to trust anyone.

I've read about a hundred books so far.

How do we know he's innocent?
Did you wash the dishes?
When he returned from his duty in Afghanistan, Tom was haunted by nightmares.
I've made up my mind.
My hands are cold.
Thank you so much!
The best lecture you can attend is the one you don't understand.
That won't have any effect.
Don't puke.

I need your help.
Don't you like swimming?
I'm a responsible person.
We have wine.

Add more water.
How was your day?
What Tom's proposing could save us all some time.

It's beautiful!
He's pretty busy now.
We're not proud of it.
It's a Cuban cigar.
That's his car.
Of course!
Tom cooks potatoes to make a potato salad.
They're all gone.
Sign here.
Come closer.
I'm not always right.
Tell me what it is.
This isn't your hat, is it?
This is my wife, Edith.
That's not a good sign.

How did I miss that?

What's that thing on your right hand?
Can I call you around 2:30?
Anybody want to go to Disneyland with me?
Why is painting trains so interesting?
I don't usually write songs like this.
It's really that simple.
That was a ridiculous mistake.
What do you eat anyway?
Don't talk.
Call him whatever you want.
Don't run in front of the ore!
I feel safe with you.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to do it, but it didn't work.
Jumi will be a teacher.
I need you.

There's got to be a better way to do this.
It didn't matter to me.
Love me tomorrow!
It's too noisy for me here.
Tom must have been trying to clean this up without soap.
It was raining so hard we decided to visit another day.
I'm glad Tom won.

Do you know that Tom ever lied?
Mary is a Catholic, but her boyfriend is an atheist.
I'll never tell anyone who you really are.
I'm proud of you.
I saw Marcus' house.
Tom arrived this morning.
He's pretty busy now.
Who is this man?
Here's some good news.
Refugees are welcome.
Many economists ignore this fact.
I'm proud of my family.
Tom seemed very confused.
There was a list of available candidates.
How deep is that lake?
What age is your car?
- What's your name?
You have three cats.
Tom never said anything about it.
You're too young.
Don't stretch.
Tom never asked why.
I wouldn't hurt you.
We have no such example.
Come here. Come here.
Tom will know.
Her passport was stolen.
I know who killed him.
Did I ask you?
You can't touch it.
So far, I've seen enough.
Turn around!
Be nice.
What am I supposed to see?
It stinks.
It took four kilos of gold to win the gold medal.
I'll have dinner at seven.

I don't think your plan is realistic.
Are you acquainted with the man in question?
Will you talk to Tom for me?
I bought this yesterday.
How do you say "cat" in Spanish?
We need to act now.
I'm not afraid of death. I'm afraid of dying.
Everybody says that.
Speak clearly.
I haven't seen him in a while.
We're here to play golf.
I haven't seen her in a while.
I've never actually met Tom.
Don't shout.
This one's unique.
I'm too old for this.
We'll just follow you.
Knowing yourself is hard.
You'll need it later.
This has been a pleasant experience.
Tom's in the garage, working on his motorcycle.
You just got shot.
My income has decreased by 10 percent.
You'll see her.
It can be difficult to navigate unfamiliar terrain.

After much consideration, I ended up making things at random.
She's fine.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Does it happen often?
They were walking along the beach.

He hoped to become a famous writer.
He became a member of the club three years ago.

They told me to wait here.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
The lawyer's job is to prove her client's innocence.
How would you know that?

Canada is the home of ice hockey.
What did I forget to say?
How often do you clean your room?
He's saving money so he can go abroad.
I have no intention of changing.
I want to go to Bali.
You can do it if you try.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
I'm glad Tom won.
Okay, how about you?
This is, without a doubt, an extremely unpleasant situation for me.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
She's a morning jog before breakfast.
This time it leads to the city.
I'm not happy about that.
I baked the tongue.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.
We have two sons.
Tom was the only boy invited to Mary's party.
Don't talk.
We had a big fight.
What has science ever done for us?
Stop watching TV and start studying.
Turn left.
We don't know our neighbors.
You'll find a book in the library.
The police found the stolen money.
I've never seen that before.
I got here a few minutes before you did.
That's fantastic!
I didn't do it either.

Where's Tony?
I'd like to talk to Tony.
I'll come back later.
You smell nice.
It was obvious that Tom didn't want to kiss Maria.
Tom is so rich that even his servants have servants.
That's the table.
Flowers are blooming.
That's too bad.
His brother is a very capable doctor.
I'm done arguing.
I've got plenty of room.
What are you gonna do today?
I'm just thinking out loud.
Don't shout.
I can't stop thinking about the stolen money.
You missed that train.
Come and see us.
The young man is often thoughtless.
I don't think he knows I love you.
I'm not mad at anyone.
They need each other.
Let's get something to eat.
You think so?
Can we agree to disagree?
I'm trying to be careful.
There's always trouble when it comes to my child.
No, not yet.
One day she wants to study abroad.
Check this out.
Come quick!
Where's my suitcase?
He wants to get rid of painful memories.
You're absolutely right.
- I don't know.
I'm convinced.
Add more water!
Music is important to me.
I've been working on it day after day.
Do you have a favorite?
Please, come.
Take it easy!
No one has a soul.
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
Where there's grass, there's no water, where there's water, there's no grass.
My friend got 95 points in the math exam.
He didn't let anyone else in the room.
It's better by grace than by force.
I have a lot to do today.
You're in trouble.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
There is no word for “freedom” in the Russian language.
I thought you'd be busy.
It's great.
Could that be true?
Just be quiet, Tom.
That bag is mine.
Tom left before I got here.
Tell us a story about ghosts!
I hope Tom's safe.
We talked about it all night.
I want to live in the city.
What are you going to do this summer?
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Let's get out of here.
That must have been hard.
Your wish is my command.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
I had to make some tough decisions.
Tom is Mary's grandfather.
Ammonia is the base.
Check again.
Are you being honest?
That made sense to me.
She was educated in the United States.
Tell me what I have to do.
Open your mouth!
I wasn't told anything.
The fire spread to a nearby building before the firefighters arrived.
Tom didn't make friends as easily as Mary did.
I thought this was going to happen months ago.
The bad weather prevented me from leaving.
Tom bought the paper.
And this one's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
The black smoke was coming out of the chimney.
I know the gentleman.
You'll never catch me alive!
It's one of the biggest summer music festivals.
I was open and honest.
It's time for you to go to bed.
Give me a dollar for the book.
Close your mouth and sit down.
What the hell is this?
He's undressed.
Tom fell asleep again.
Don't move!
He's American.
Tom only talks to Mary.
Without a doubt.
The first lesson is easy.
You put on a lot of weight.
Tom's gonna make it.
I got off the train.
We're brother and sister.
I'm pretty good at doing multiple things at the same time.
No one is as fast as you.
I agreed to buy it.
She's in a bad mood.
Am I the only one going to the party?
I really hope you're joking.
Please be honest with me.
Are you being sarcastic?
Let your imagination run wild.
Okay, how about you?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove that?
You can't go in that room.
What did you do to me?
It's all here.
Why me?
Tom and Mary were wrong about that.
I'm not as tall as you.
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
If you do, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
You're a balm for the soul.
Tom was quiet for a moment.
I knew I should never have interfered in your stupid business.
The light disappeared on its own.
Tom begged Mary to give him another chance.
Ask the police!
We have five fingers on each hand.
We've cooperated.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom's saving to buy a yacht.
Everyone but Tom knows why his wife left him.
You're driving me crazy.
What does the newspaper say?
The system was repaired after three years of volunteer work.
I need your signature.
She called me very late last night.
I had nothing in common with them.
I'm claustrophobic.
Apparently, he lives in the White House.
The new branch to Haugesund will become the main effective travel link to Oslo and Eastern Norway for the entire western region.
You let me down.
Hello, how are you?
She received four e-mails.
I'm really happy about that.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are up to something.
Where did you find this knife?
You look good for your age.
Tom was able to find Mary's house without difficulty.
It's not an easy sport.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.
I just won't do it.
You shouldn't have bought that.
They have the right to vote.
I find it hard to put into words what I think.
Tell me where you are.
Are we going to see Tom again?
Turn right at the next corner.
My mother cooks for me.
I'm trying to be careful.
A woman eats bread.
I was listening to music.
Are you involved in this?
You know why I'm here?
I hope they don't notice my mistake.
I must have eaten something bad.
We'll be leaving soon.
Is Tom still there?
Tom can't swim like he used to.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Both answers are possible.
Tom's working too hard.
Avoid those who are addicted to color thinners.
I liked that one.
He did not hide his disappointment.
The boy has a horse.
Do you like roller-skating?
We're out of food.
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
It's a good time today.
Can you make Tom laugh?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I have been busy.
Proletarians of all countries, unite!
I'm very impressed.
I assumed you were busy.
He couldn't attend because he was sick.
Tell me why you did it.
Italy is in Europe.
How many people were there?
I'm sure Tom will miss me very much.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Mary came home from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
You have a right to be happy.
I don't think anyone knows.
You have to work harder.
Why are you so paranoid?
He turned around in the room, unable to calm down.
Could I have a hug?
I found an empty cage.
Get some rest, Tom.
What does he want to do?
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you come by sometime?
She wonders how this is possible.
Santa lives on the North Pole.
He was born in Ohio.
Please, go.
Look at that.
Wake up! Wake up!
You picked the pretty one.
Look how big it is!
I tried to be nice.
Mary's a wedding planner.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I have a hard time talking about my feelings.
I'll give you anything you want.
It's their book.
Mary came home from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
I'm not sure when Tom's gonna get here.
You should come home.
Alice laughed.
She can't be bribed.
Will you turn off the light?
I'll save you.
I'll keep you posted.
We can watch Tom in a suit, behind a black grand piano with dramatic finger movements, creating music that is very pleasant to listen to.
Strong winds blew a lot of branches off the trees last night.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
We need to prepare the ground for negotiations.
Aren't you supposed to be getting ready for work?
There are 40 students in this class.
They laughed at his mistake.
The way to a man's heart is through his stomach.
Every ship needs a captain.
It's time to get up.
The house is made of brick.
I didn't write this.
I got off at the wrong bus stop.
I can't help but feel partly responsible.
People were nice to me.
I know this is weird.
Tom's out of sight now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary are leaving today.
Have you ever tried it?
Dr. Jackson has a good relationship with the patient.
My father lives and works in Tokyo.
Are you a student?
Can I scratch for a cigarette?
I could go with you.
Have some.
Come on in.
Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest skyscraper in the world.
How many blankets are on the bed?
There's really no need to do that.
Why are you so smart?
I'm cooking lunch.
I wonder what Tom's going to do.
I'm fat.
In order to join the choir, you need to be able to read the notes.
Tom took a nap.
They wanted an apology.
Where did I go wrong?
Our school was founded in 1990.
Does that make you angry?
I drink vitamins every day.
I'll call you later.
Why me?
Obviously, I was too optimistic.
Tom's cooking for us.
We live in a house.
You're not done yet?
You're very rude.
He makes good money.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one who can do it here.
The zoo is closed on Mondays.
That's the point.
Knowledge of foreign languages is beneficial for everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She let me go.
It is very natural for a human being to always give himself an advantage over the interests of others.
I'm eating here.
It's all good.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I have a lot of things planned for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
He was named captain of the football team.
Why are you still awake?
I was at school yesterday.
Tom does what he's told.
I'm still working.
Stubborn, insensitive children can sometimes grow up to be sociopaths.
I'd like him to be with you.
The job of the police is to prevent and investigate crime.
Can you pass me the remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
After you.
We all work too hard.
I'm Ricardo.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
He learns very quickly.
You're different.
She doesn't know the hatred of others.
This will make our job a lot easier.
He adores football.
What time can you come?
The monks were able to play tennis in the monasteries.
No one trusts him anymore.
Keep children away from drugs.
Is he your new boyfriend?
I wondered if I might be dreaming.
Everything changes over time.
Nobody's going anywhere.
The game may be delayed until next week.
I have a soul.
Drive to work for an hour and a half.
That's right.
Your time will come soon enough.
Tom had no idea I was going to be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm a natural.
I turned around.
I totally forgot to do that.
Marriage is the root cause of all divorces.
It's right here.
I'll make something up.
It all started a year ago when he came home.
Play it again, Sam.
Do you drink coffee?
Some of us think that such views are pure madness.
Works.
Somebody could get hurt.
Tom didn't write any letters to Mary until he was here.
We've had enough of you.
You won't be able to take this job.
We all know it's Tom's fault.
She's Chinese.
I don't drink vodka.
We need to be reasonable.
I'll be in the back.
Look at these.
He needs it.
Don't forget to extend your passport.
I think Tom pulled a thicker end.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
I'm more worried about you than I am about the future of Japan.
I couldn't help feeling sorry for him.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a slight nausea.
Is that the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's okay.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
I'm soaked to the skin.
Come play with us.
And it was only with great difficulty.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Few people know that it exists.
Did you write down the number?
That's no reason to panic.
I only got 20 points on the math exam.
The worst headaches are caused by poorly understood ideas.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I got married.
Investigate this.
- What's your name?
They're trying.
My future is in your hands.
He's a liar, isn't he?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
Tom is cold-blooded.
That's what I'm used to doing.
I met him the day before.
Don't stop.
Help us find this card.
Can you tell silver from tin?
Hands up!
I don't practice as much as I should.
I'm not mad at anyone.
I think that's really important.
She doesn't speak English, let alone French.
That's so sad.
How clever!
You should know better.
In short, I disagree.
I'm a responsible person.
You're not dating anyone, are you?
She's a teacher.
Without water it is impossible to live.
I used to play the piano a long time ago, so I can still play a little bit.
Is this your glass, or your sister's?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Mother and daughter represent two generations.
We're finally here!
He's in good hands.
He told himself that he had to work in the garden for two hours a day.
Apples and pears are given, not gold and green forests.
I'm resting my legs.
The teacher’s words are almost perfect.
Do you want to learn something specific?
I really like to exercise.
I love you.
I'm really proud of that.
We were in last place.
I contributed.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
I can read German, but I can't say it.
That doesn't sound like you.
She achieved her goal.
I'm twice as old as Tom.
Madness has crossed the line.
Isn't that black?
This is not a children's book.
You're absolutely right.
Come sit next to me.
We know we're better than that.
Like I don't know that!
Let's not talk about this right now.
Have a good time.
It's time to part.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
They know you.
He was the son of a wealthy merchant.
The execution of the meeting is ready.
I said I'd wait for you.
She looks good for her age.
What the hell is this?
What are you eating, anyway?
I don't like being judged.
I have an appointment tonight.
Tom enjoys fishing.
A man hopes for as long as he lives.
You be careful.
Let's discuss the options.
Don't worry, if you help me, everything will be fine.
I was struck by a miracle.
It was a funny movie.
We just saw her.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom will take care of this.
Go take a look.
Some of us hate it.
"This came for you." "Uh..." "Well, do you remember the one she sent you when you asked her to give you pictures of Applejack's brother?" "Yes." And then she told you to write a critique of Mac's physical appearance." "Yes." "Then she sent a critique to Mac." "...Yes." "What did you tell her that you learned from that?" "Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I've always loved horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People were nice to me.
How did I miss that?
I don't want to take up any more of your time.
I only go to church out of respect for my mother.
It is better to live one day as a lion than a hundred years as a sheep.
"Did he explain it?" "Yes."
Not all lights are magic.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
He killed himself.
I was very excited.
You don't have to eat right before you go to bed.
Tom will wait.
What's going to happen now?
I need five more minutes.
The students did not know how to respond.
He's ashamed of lying.
I'm not a night owl.
Did you get the package I sent you?
I'm not a doctor.
My baby wants to talk.
It's good to see you again.
Tom bought me a VIP ticket.
I'm fat.
I'm the one who has to do it.
Tom will call.
He lit the torch before entering the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a really good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom dropped out of college.
Why do you hate me so much?
What am I doing here?
Tom will understand.
These girls are very busy.
Give us some space.
There's truth in what Tom's saying.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of your whining.
Get out of here!
We have two TVs.
We like to play football.
Make room.
The horse must have tripped and the knight fell off the horse.
I haven't forgotten.
There are islands at sea.
I'm investigating it right now.
Mini skirts are fashionable again.
What are we really looking for?
She's achieved her goal.
He can do whatever he wants, as far as I'm concerned.
Tom said he needed the money.
Tom was pretty good.
Hurry up!
He couldn't understand much of what they said to each other.
This medicine will relieve your headache.
He disappeared without a trace.
Oh, leave me alone.
That's what they both like.
We sat together in silence for a while.
You look great.
I'm home.
He never takes the train.

It's your election.
That makes sense.
It's safer.
Tell me about your teacher.
I saw the house.
Maybe she has other plans?
That's not a sentence.
Thank you all for coming! See you next time.
The patient died.
Thank you all for that.

If you want to talk to a lot of people, you need to learn Esperanto. Why this language? Because it is both beautiful and stimulates our learning.

What makes you think Tom would do that?
They'll know.

If we leave now, we'll be in Boston by 2:30.
What did you two do?
Where's Tom going to sleep?
Emily was surprised.
I'm not ready yet.
Why would Tom want that?
It's hard to know what really happened.
She ran her fingers through her hair.
He works hard to support his family.

It's treason.
I'm not late, am I?
Let's go get Tom.
Tell me where you live.
There's an error in the sentence.
You don't remember anything?
Are we ready to go?
Tom drinks a lot.
I'm not from around here.
That's quite a problem.
Tom was sitting on the grass under a coconut tree.
Everyone was laughing.

Can I go?
Tom doesn't like to do that.
Excuse me, who is this woman?
Do you have a copy?
Come and help me.
I barely got out of the house when it started to rain.
He likes to be busy.
Okay, as always.
First one.
Tom's just lazy.
I'm a little beat up.
Does that mean you love me?
Does Tom eat fish?
The garage is rusted.
Check this out.

Tom turned on the blinker.
Tom always makes me laugh.
She rarely, perhaps never, goes to bed before 11 o'clock.
Are they all crazy?

That's my job, not Tom's.
Tell me what it is.

Could you have read it?
It's a glass window.
Are you done yet?
My knife is sharp.
Does Tom have a key?
The doctors are looking at an X-ray.
Don't talk.
Don't stop.
Are you sure this is safe?
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't know.
You'll be better in a few days.
That's what Tom would want us to do.
He tried to kill himself.
Tom said to ask you.
Everybody knows that.
She enjoyed yesterday's party.
Just tell me the truth.
The birds sing.
Be careful: we write nationalities, days of the week and languages in capital letters in English.
I love watching you work.
The birds fly.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not outraged at all.
As far as we know, Tom's guilty.
Oh, I love you.
Tom's a bookworm.
I changed my mind.
Problem is, it's too expensive.
Many would like to be motivated, creative, thinking beings, if only they could get that chance.
I've been thinking a lot about what you said.
Did Tom draw a thick end?
I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of dying.
We like him.
That's a good answer.
You sound tired.
Tom was wrong about that.
I don't need anything.
Tom always makes a mess of things.
He was running.
That's not the real thing.
Please write down everything I say.
Without difficulty, there is no science.

Maybe you can't hear me.
We're grilling.
I'm mad at you.
I thought you were married.
I'll find the money somehow.
I assumed you were busy.
He's not a scientist, but he's our friend.
I hear Tom's interested.
We need to move forward.
What are your ambitions?
I don't like eating garlic in the morning.
I think Tom's very smart.
Do you really want to learn another language?
Fish, please.
I think I'm fat.
I think we got lucky.
Don't talk.
Is French taught in your school?
Come have a drink with me.
If I could understand, I would tell you so.
You're running.
I took the first step.
Stop screaming.
It's Saturday.
They were evacuated to the American Field Hospital.
We'll run in the park.
How far is it from here?
You can't sit next to me.
I'm not happy about that.
Could you have read it?
Will you dance with me?
We need to call Tom.
Tom's not strong enough.
We need more flour.
Tell me what he says here.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I'm staying.

I never thought of it that way.
I know Tom let you down.
He's always unhappy.
Tom was seriously injured.

I'm sure there's a better way to do it.
The first one leaves at 17:30 and arrives at 20:25.
That was kind of weird.
Plants are growing.
Does Tom read and write Japanese?
Tom put the card on the table.
I called him.
It was all just an accident.
Tom never even saw us.
Mom, I'm hungry.
I don't intend to do that.
Tom says he wasn't here.
That usually works.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
I locked the bike.
And now a word from our sponsor.
I'm not at all happy with the situation.
Do you have a copy?
We can't call him as a witness.
That's not the main question.
We're glad we're here.
Stay calm.
I'm armed.
Tom couldn't resist.
Our eyes can't see infrared rays.
It's time for bed.
Tom's very intelligent.
Can I replace this?
He wanted to have a more beautiful cat than his neighbor.
I'm impressed with you.
Did you bring a hairdryer?
I already ordered it.
We'll never know the reason.
How are you feeling?
Everyone tells me I'm weird.
Bitcoin and Ethereum are virtual currencies.
It's all very cheap.
Anything you can think of can help.
A lot of predictions don't come true.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm still wrong.
Turned out to be true.
I'm bitter.
Did you return the book to the library?

He is an activist in his community.
I'm deaf and mute when I eat.
You look fat.
Learning a language is not easy.
Does your head hurt?
You have to learn English step by step.
Tom is better off now than he was before.
Jesus and Mary are as different as heaven and earth.
Tom asked me for my opinion on who would win the race.
A man has many desires that he actually does not want to be fulfilled and it would even be wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be a bitter disappointment for him. One of such desires is also the desire for eternal life. If it were fulfilled, a man would become completely ill from eternal life, and would long for death.
Water is a liquid.
Does Tom really speak French?
I can't trust him.
I'm not a prophet.
I can't fix the car by myself.
She's taking care of her old mother.
Italy is a long way from Brazil.
Tom had the same problem.
Don't laugh.
My wife's father is my father-in-law.
I want to live in the city.
Tom and I just wrote a couple of books together.
I think this is the beginning of a wonderful friendship.
The news has arrived.
No one really wants us.
They all paid.
You be careful.
Yogurt is made from milk and cream.
I'm alone.
Okay, how about you?
Don't drink the water.
I don't want to ruin your day.
That was just the beginning.
The book is sold out.
The price of gold changes every day.
Be nice.
Look around you!
Tom got married.
I could come with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
He's a scientist.
You don't have permission to enter that room.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
Tom hates his little bedroom.
Why is it so interesting to paint trains?
I hope you like it.
Welcome back.
He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!
Tom's a commoner.
We can't go back.
I'm gonna take a shower.
What are you planning to do this summer?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Could anything be more romantic?
Beethoven wrote nine symphonies.
I'll hurry.
We'll do the job.
It's time for the truth.
It's none of our business.
Do you like costumes?
Why do you ask?
I saw Markus' house.
At least he's honest.
It's really quite bad.
Thank you all for that.
They wouldn't follow us.
You too, Brutus?
The house where Ataturk was born in Thessaloniki.
People make mistakes.
It's snowing.
I thought you needed help.
Does this make sense?
I like your glasses.

He's got two cars.
That was three months ago.
I know your name.
Let's hear your excuse.
Dad said no.
They've formed a swim team.
Tom took the package to the orphanage.
Keep digging.
Tom jumped up and down.
Tom's dog lay down.
Don't talk.
This information is confidential.
You taught us that.
Oh, no.
Go find something else to do.
They're not mine.
I'm ready!
You're not gonna leave me, are you?
Don't overdo it.
I can't approve this project.
You're texting Mary?
I'll save you a seat in the front row.
Mary pushes her children to play football.
Have they arrived yet?
Don't forget to give me my pen back.
Small flowers bloom at night.
I counted to 200.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
One day you should try it.
I'm staying home with my grandparents for the weekend.
What have you concluded?
I prayed for you.
No, that's all.
Come to my house.
Tom's on the edge of his seat.
The bathroom is upstairs.
It's Christmas tomorrow.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom tricked you.
Tom reads a lot.
It's only a few minutes away.
What do you know about me?
He wants to work at the hospital.
I'm not saying anything.
I got off the bus.
You are the average student.
In childhood, many violent criminals ruthlessly tortured animals.
I'm going to live in Cambodia.
How long are you gonna be mad and yell at us?
Please, stop here.
How much does it really matter?
Shall we have an aperitif?
Tom complains all the time.
If you want, I'll teach you to play the ukulele.
I'm used to it.
It's not that bad.
I guess she was offended by what he said.
I love to listen to music written by my friends.
Tom admitted it.
I've been there twice.
Actions speak more than words.
Is this where Tom sits?
That's enough!
It's hard to work with you.
Tom got fat.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
I'm guilty.
Don't answer that.
Get the wine.
Things aren't always what they seem.
Show me the photos!
A few old houses need to be demolished.
What were you doing?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom snuck into the party.
I'm so tired I can't study.
I've never seen his face.
Tom is very considerate.
When are you going to go?
This report wasn't written very well.
I want a new bike.
She said the government's latest move has multiple meanings.
They say love is blind.
Tom arrived this morning.
It took about a year.
How did I miss that?
Tom didn't answer me.
The five brothers worked together on the farm.
It could be a trick.
The company is known for its high quality products.
Don't forget to apply sunscreen.
Tom didn't try to deny Mary's conviction.
Tell me what this is.
Thank you for accepting my request for a friend on Facebook.
His hair covered almost his entire face.
How can I hate Tom?
India is the seventh largest country in the world.
How much did you have to pay Tom to get him to clear the snow off the roof?
I'll make it up to you.
Why is he here?
One student from Oslo who falsified his diploma to enroll in college was sentenced to prison.
Tom knows it's over.
I wish I'd thought of that.
Tom made a vegetarian chili.
I wanted to help you.
You've been really good to me.
I will finish reading this book.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Did you wash the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I usually look happy?
It's not the essay itself that's the problem, it's all these devastating questions and explanations of words that drive me crazy!
The weekend's here.
I'll be back next week.
It looks uncomfortable.
What did you both do?
I really want to see her.
That was a lucky shot.
I thought Tom was amazing.
I've never seen anything like it before.
I buy a lot of stuff in that store.
Did you receive the package I sent you?
I wish you were there for me.
Try this.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
He began to scream.
I'll be there when I finish my homework.
Clean it up.
Can I use your dictionary?
Did you manage to do it yourself?
Don't push.
Can we try this?
Most people like chicken.
Is Tom out of his mind?
I didn't do that either.
Are you ready?
Let's take another look.
The last time I went to the beach, I was burned to a crisp.
Pull back.
The city was destroyed during the war.
Watch out here, Tom.
We fixed some of the damage caused by the splashing of rocks on your car.
I became a pensioner after 45 years in the office.
Why are you suddenly curious?
His girlfriend didn't offer any support.
I just took a bath.
Are you suspicious of me?
Luckily, he wasn't seriously injured.
Generally, children like sweets.
Tom's gonna cry.
We need your help.
I think we've had enough to eat.
You scared us.
Are you ready for more?
Just try it.
Tom's upstairs.
We'll try it your way.
Tom decided to take the day off.
How could I resist?
Gold is much heavier than water.
The phone is a wonderful device.
Tom's afraid of death.
I can't fix the car by myself.
One language is never enough.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
This is the address.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I don't believe it.
My mother died the day I got married.
Don't let anyone in!
What would Tom think?
We're not getting into that.
It happens to everyone sooner or later.
This is my question.
Hang in there, Tom.
Tom definitely made it to the end.
Follow me.
I don't care what your name is.
He has no equal.
There's nothing wrong with me.
It's obvious Tom's sick.
I started learning English when I was twelve. At that time I was interested in languages, but not to that extent. Now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; therefore, it's time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember the melody of that song.
I'm Ricardo.
I need an honest girl.
She's a rookie.
Are they still there?
I'm sure Tom will miss me very much.
Tom won't run away.
I'd go.
I don't take bribes.
Get down!
Tom couldn't stand it.
Anything you can think of can help.
You will feel better in a few days.
What language do you speak?
It's not something to worry about.
I realize they're a thorn in the side of people like you, but this is just pathetic.
Tom's gonna make it.
There's no free lunch.
So what if I'm gay?
Anyway, he'll definitely come.
Please leave this place as clean as you would like to find it.
We'll go through the jungle somehow.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
There's only so much we can do.
Friends, can I talk to you for a minute?
It's your life.
- What's your name?
Yes, sir.
We got lucky, didn't we?
I feel like crying.
I'm sorry.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
He'll be done soon.
You learn by doing.
You'll never walk alone.
Tom's the one you want.
The police are after me.
Did you see anyone there?
Either way, you're wrong.
They won't take it.
There is no rule without exception.
Maybe you need a shovel.
There are all kinds of flowers in the garden.
Nobody said anything.
The book's on the table.
He's a real aristocrat.
I'm doing my job.
It's all quiet again.
I didn't make it.
We know.
Tom's going to graphic design school.
He lied to you.
Since the message was in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always unhappy.
Music is his passion.
You should face reality.
Light waves pass through space and various materials.
We were able to get out in time.
I've had enough of everything.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
Carthage must be destroyed!
How much does it cost?
I want to talk to Tom about it.
We have some options.
It should work.
She hated him.
As far as I'm concerned, I'm not opposed to your opinion.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I could talk to Tom.
It just happens that way.
Have some.
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?
I'm so hungry for all this running.
I'm a translator.
It was hot in every sense of the word.
The spider tickles me.
Talk about others like they'd like to talk about you!
He was so confused that he didn't even know what question to ask.
Are you ready?
Find Tom.
Seems OK to me.
Whatever do you think?
You changed my life.
Somehow we'll make it through the jungle.
Reaction isn't always the best way to go.
I won't tell anyone you did it.
Tom asked Mary to take him to the airport.
The Committee recommends that those who have complained should be reimbursed with a pro rata share of the annual fee with interest.
Tom bought the time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of surreal.
In theory it is possible, but in practice it is very difficult.
I don't have time to write.
It's time to get up.
It was almost worth it.
Please send me your picture.
That's my money, too.
Either way, it's over.
Tom's upset.
Remember the name of the file before you try to restore the deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom ran down the street.
The answer to this question is simple.
Let's get to work.
Only vodka from Russia is real Russian vodka!
I didn't get nervous about it.
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
We won't let you die.
A lot of things get out of hand.
He wants to teach his children the importance of work.
He's always been a pig.
I'm not married to Tom.
Is it yours?
Tom is one of the best lawyers in Boston.
How much do I get?
How many close friends do you have?
It's happening.
How long do you think Tom was preparing for the exam?
A book that describes the wonders of nature.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You shouldn't throw stones at a glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was silent for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
He exhaled.
I tried to get Tom to come home.
I'd like to get involved.
You can't touch that.
Not epileptics.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone.
Mary is a retired nurse.
I probably won't be watching TV tonight.
Did Tom draw a thicker end?
Give me all the money.
Mer was a great supporter.
Those are nice shoes.
The girl sees the boy.
We call Robert "Bob."
It is very difficult, almost impossible, to find an apartment in Oslo.
My French is still not very good.
They're teachers.
The government fell after a vote in parliament.
You're not funny.
Tom's gone instead of Mary.
The notebook isn't yours, it's his.
It happened right here.
He was driving his car down the street.
I don't know Latin very well.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
I don't speak Japanese.
He didn't understand anything.
I'm waiting my turn.
That's not the main question.
I've been very shaken by the news.
The girl eats bread.
I don't speak English.
You're not the one who died.
Would you rather have tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
I'm a woman.
Tom asked for help.
It's not like that.
They know you.
I passed every test.
What are you going to do today?
What's on your mind?
I'll kill you!
I was cold as a spritzer.
There is no point in just waiting for something to happen; you have to do something right now.
Here's the key to my apartment.
It's an area with a lot of new homes.
I can't believe all this.
I could have left, but I didn't want to.
Yesterday it was snowing.
We walked through the park.
I was in a great mood.
Tom hid a spare key in his garden.
Let's pretend we're aliens.
I'm sure Tom will win.
I got off at the wrong bus stop.
I wrote this song just for you.
Your house, your freedom.
Have you read the Holy Bible?
And if I was rich, I wouldn't give him the money.
Are we safe now?
Stop it!
We've been studying all afternoon.
Are you going to send this as a mail order?
What do you suggest?
It is said that love is blind.
I don't have any homework today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?
The sky was darker and darker.
Watch out!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
The room is dark.
Come on, give me that.
Do you blame me?
I wish I was pretty.
For some strange people, knowledge of a language is kept secret.
I don't intend to change.
They slowly moved forward.
Why is love so hard?
I survived.
Do you know how to use this machine?
I'm late, aren't I?
Don't stare.
It's blue for you.
Come visit us soon.
Were you in an accident?
What are you and Tom doing?
Tom's worried about what might happen.
He was an honorable man.
My father doesn't like football.
I don't know if I'll have time.
I went there voluntarily.
We're all out of alcohol.
Map, please.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
Something was on the ground.
Children are the flowers of our lives.
Why are we laughing?
My friend lives behind God's feet.
Do you think Tom would like to go fishing with us next weekend?
She yelled at him, but he didn’t hear her.
Water is life.
What are you gonna do today?
He will probably win the championship.
After silence, what most accurately expresses the unspeakable is music.
Tom looks like a banker.
It's Tom.
It's not over until it's over.
Tom still looks worried.
I didn't see anything.
Mary is a very shy girl.
Where's the vodka?
Tom doesn't have that kind of problem.
You can't keep secrets from me.
It just happened again.
You've got a busy day ahead of you.
She's fine.
Does that mean you love me?
It's really pretty bad.
I won't participate.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Justice must be fully served.
Tom and Mary would make a wonderful couple.
How do you say XXX in Dutch?
Don't work too hard!
I'm so fat.
Let's stay inside tonight.
I thought Tom was amazing.
People don't always behave rationally.
I didn't do that either.
Did you pass the exams?
We're gonna have to walk now.
I'll set you free.
I wholeheartedly support your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.
How about we create a Facebook group so we can discuss foreign language learning?
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Did we agree?
It's not that bad.
Let's talk in the hallway.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Quit smoking.
Tom went that way.
You owe me an apology.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't either.
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom used to be afraid of me.
Tom whispered something to Mary, and she smiled.
But why?
Can I see your map?
What's going to happen now?
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
They set up the library with new books.
It's clear.
How about some chocolate cheese?
It's your daughter's birthday today.
Will somebody tell me what to do?
It's obviously a typing error.
Your book is twice as big as mine.
We're not both as rich as we'd like to be.
Tom wouldn't be pleased.
Tom has a nice garden.
A cup of coffee cleared my head.
Do I have a knife?
It makes no sense to spend time in college.
It just happened again.
It's Christmas.
Tom has naughty hair.
So far, I've seen enough.
That's what I hate.
We'll miss you so much if you go to Japan.
Tell me what's gonna happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Tom will take a look.
Tom ate a sandwich.
Here's what I think.
I wanna go.
I could go with you.
The cost of living is rising.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Can you defuse a bomb?
I think Tom might be able to do that.
I need five more minutes.
He sleeps like a baby.
I bet you know who told me that.
Mary used the apples Tom gave her to make butter out of apples.
How many songs have you written?
Where's your head?
We're glad to have you here.

Tom's a little worried.
Tom is the best student in the class.
How is this your fault?
My phone number is 9876-5432.
Why don't you just tell Tom?
How did I miss this?
This is a sentence.
Life is sweet.
That's my cat.
What am I going to write here?
I am deeply ashamed.
My father bought me a book.
I'm flexible.
Citizenship is a prerequisite for voting.
How many times have you been here?
I don't know who they are.
He's fixing electronic devices.
Sing, please.
You lose.
I'm ready, bro.
Please kick as hard as you can.
This fish is big.
Pass the sugar, please.
It's nice to be needed by someone.
I hope we understand this.
We all have to stand up to this.
Where's the toothpaste?
Mrs. Klein is in her eighties, but she's still very active.
I'm not sure when Tom's coming back.
Trust me.
This is my computer.
I thought it was shocking.
Then our manager came up with a good idea and we made a great plan.
We know enough.
I just want to eat something.
I'm so tired, I can barely keep my eyes open.
Gardening is fun.
It's never too late to learn.
Can I have some sugar, please?
Come quickly!
Cover your mouth when you cough, sneeze, or yawn.
Where'd you find the keys?

Just give me the money.
She's pregnant.
Tom gave me a few books.
Don't let Tom know.
I can't wait for Monday.
Have you been here before?
Does Tom have any experience?
I don't get it.
Come here for a second.
So what did Tom see?
How much is this umbrella?
I'm burning up for her.
Tom did his homework in the kitchen.
I could kill you right now.
Mary used walking sticks to help her with the ups and downs of her journey.
Suck my dick.
The compass points north.
Don't talk.
Some religious people can be very judgmental.
On whose initiative was this done?
Finish this.
Which one should I take?
I like cable food.

This takes forever.

Give me the other box.
He has an older brother, John.
I'd take it.
Humans are complicated organisms.
They'll know what to do.
Why did you keep quiet the whole time?
He's undressed.
He saw Leila's reaction.
I have a laptop.
Can I ask you a favor?
He got away.
It was fun to celebrate together.
I'm afraid I've dislocated my right shoulder.
Get up!
You really should take a shower.
What is the purpose of life?
I don't want to work under those conditions.
Mayuko avoided the hard work.
She has short hair.
Drive the pole.
My right hand is numb.
I know almost nothing about you.
Did you do something?
You taught us that.
You can't talk to her.
You should probably talk a little slower.
Happy Mother's Day!
I need a beer.
You're not funny.
Everyone appreciates Henry.
I thought you were married.
It was a great success.
Sit down, please.
Does that happen often?
A little bird told me.
I couldn't see who it was about.
I feel safe with you.
Crazy!
You pay me well.
I'm glad people saw it.
You need to talk to me.
The president opened the meeting.
It just wasn't our day.

This might hurt a little.
They can speak a little Spanish.
Finish this.
He tried to talk Mary out of it.
Can you pass me the water, please?
It doesn't matter where I am.
Where were you in Japan?
They're all gone.
I'll study harder.
I'm hurt.
I bought them for you.
Is the world unfair?
None of us have seen Tom do it.
Do you love your mother?
I'm Tom's grandfather.
And you wonder why we can't stand your company?
The more I know people, the more I admire dogs.
You spelled my name wrong.
You're different.
Tom can't stay.
You're embarrassing her.
I have two cats.
There were about a thousand people.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
His girlfriend wasn't supportive.
I had dinner with him.
I wasn't interested in that.
Some of them were, and still are, in constant danger of political repression and persecution.
I think your plan is too ambitious.
I don't think the internet is a place for kids.
That was hard for me.
My teacher gave me the longest chapter.
What'd you figure out?
You were made for me.
He needs it.
It's obviously a tipfeler.
Are we done here?
Do I look like I'm seeing things?
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom broke into Harvard.
She's my first love.
You ever seen one?
Are we safe now?
Tom's not a tinkerer.
Control yourselves.
I'm tired enough, but I'm fine.
Butter is made from milk.
You tell her.
I'd take it.
You're my luck.
I'm waiting for the bus.
Bad things will happen.
You're wrong.
Several trees fell during the storm in our area.
I'm sure I've seen her somewhere before.
They all smiled.
I didn't know you were so rich.
We listened carefully so as not to miss a word.
Do you have trouble understanding what women or young children are telling you?
Looks like Cathy likes music.
He refused to comment.
Imagine yourself in my place.
Can you prove that?
We're trying.
I'm out.
I'm disappointed in you.
Tom looked angry.
Don't overdo it.
Oh, yeah, I'll be busy tomorrow.
Nobody cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
I'm sorry.
I haven't been home all day.
I'd appreciate it if you'd stay till tomorrow.
I'm sure they need you.
He's everything, just not fair.
The bullet pierced the helmet.
Tom's not a good worker.
I'm here to help.
I'm smart.
I think my writing is going very well.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
Show me the pictures!
That helps us a lot.
I filled a glass.
I'm not picky.
How many aunts and uncles do you have?
That morning, Mary visited the whole village.
The rumor quickly spread.
Am I that different?
Tom took out the keys and opened the door.
Heather trusts me.
I just got here.
I played with Tony yesterday.
What he did helped a lot.
I know him well.
Without tools, there is no craft.
I've never noticed that before.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Mr. Jackson is our teacher.
I'm not at all worried.
It helps.
Dima slept with 25 men in one night and then killed them.
I'm not doing it again.
I thought you wouldn't know how to do that.
We'll just follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we coming soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I'm sure you two will agree.
I hope I'm not the only one who's gonna be there.
Are you angry about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
This makes me very uncomfortable.
We're from Russia.
The cost will soon rise.
I work in a language school.
Was I really that happy?
Tom might be the one who did it.
That sounds familiar.
It's always been that way.
I'll go to sea tomorrow if it's nice.
Deaf people can speak sign language.
Jane is sick in bed.
I'm warning you!
Tom's gonna call.

What do you have to do?
Cows give milk.
Tom likes to drive.
I've been looking for you.
I'm a woman.
It's all important.
They couldn't travel because there was a problem.

The child continued to cry for hours.
I'd buy that one.
This goes beyond all boundaries.
I have a headache today.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
I wanna go.
Apparently, I was a little shocked.

Her words made him angry.

It's pretty good.
I was definitely lucky.
I hope that's true.
I wonder whose sentence that is.
Tom bought time.
Everyone held their breath.
Read this.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember the name.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.

Translation is not nearly as easy as many people think.

Is everything okay between us?
I've never camped.
I thought the food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We counted the years on the tree that we knocked down and found that it was thirty years old.
See you later, Tom.
Would you like some fruit juice?
Let's make an appointment.
I pissed him off.
Why can't you get it?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
Tom still seems rattled.
I'm a very sad man.
Boston is a great city.
We hope people will like it.

I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
He's not missing anything.
Tom will take a look.
I was wondering if anyone could help me, but I have a cell phone that just shows an error message.
I'm surprised.
Everyone was smiling.
I miss him.
You should spend more time outside and less time inside.

Cheer up!
- Who is she?
I bought this yesterday.
The odds are against me.
I'll quit.
The kids are playing outside.
There's nothing wrong with you.
Do what you want, I don't care.
She expects us to help her.
Who the hell are you?
Call me any time, I always have a shoulder to cry on.
Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
Oh, that's good.
I don't want to push you.
Tell me what's gonna happen.
Tom's seen enough.
Thank you for coming!
What's your blood type?
Are we leaving soon?
I found him a book.
They sell sugar at the store.
Tom and Mary watched the sunset together.

This is the beginning of a new era.
Mary looks cute no matter what she's wearing.
Shit happens.
Watch out!
Tom was unable to provide any evidence to support his statement.
Why would Tom come now?
Are you sure this is safe?

You have a bad temper.
Is this your phone?
I was just on my way.

This house was built by a famous architect.

I'm not a good swimmer.
Does he love me?
Tom made an omelet.
Let's find out for sure.
I'm fickle.
Yesterday I was happy.
The way Mary slammed the door, Tom realized she was sad.
Husbands and wives should help each other as long as they live.
All we need is water.
I wonder if Tom likes dancing as much as Maria does.
What would you like to know?
Now's not the best time.
He's not a kid anymore.

Tom made it himself.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
He's screwed up again.
Is that what it takes?
Take it all.
You tried.

I wouldn't hurt him.
Would you be able to do that?

I don't want Tom to see me naked.
I have one brother.
You're the most boring person I know.
Contact Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you that kind of information.
I didn't do it.
I have a few friends.
I have to look for her.
I can't wait.
I'll check.
Tom was shocked.
One moment, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom wants to know when you're done.
Give me a call.
Tom still looks shaken.
That's what the doctor ordered.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "(Not P) and/or Q".
He speaks English.

Do you believe in eternal life?
I could eat a horse.
I've never really met Tom.
Which is easier?
Tom asked for an increase.
Fadil wasn't in the house.
I've never noticed that before.

What are you supposed to do?
I've always liked Tom better.
Where was Tom hiding?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train on his way to work.
I have house ghosts.
Look at that.
We'll save this piece of cake for Tom.
You're funny.
Are Tom and Mary really married?
Horses sleep standing up.
Let me try another one.
Work slowly.
I didn't do that either.
Snorri Sturluson's stories speak, among other things, of the spread of Christianity in Norway through violence.
Answer me right now.
Make yourself at home!

Did you know that before?
I'll try to convince Tom to do it.
Am I that different?
I tripped.
I assumed you were busy.
Since when are you running away?
That elegant gilded chain with hearts is a necklace that will "shake your world."
Your answer is correct.
I love Leanne.
It all happened at lightning speed.
Do we have to tell Tom?
It was raining hard.
There's milk in the fridge.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
You can sit next to me.
Have some more.
You're irrational.
I'm angry.
Don't argue with me.
The dinner was held at the White House.

I missed so many opportunities.
We heard her crying.
It's helped me a lot.
You don't have to yell, I'm not deaf!
Give me another example.
Tom still has a little time.
We don't have a choice.
Baseball is boring.
Tom was more than generous.
She's violent right now, and she needs to be avoided.
I was just stalling.
I'm sure it wasn't intentional.
Tell him I'm innocent.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
I'll visit him in a few weeks.
Italy is not Greece.
It's for my friend.
They don't speak English.
We're lost, aren't we?
We're not gonna let you die.
Did you go to see Tom?
What's that?
He surrendered.
I can't wait forever.
This is the beginning of a new era.
America is one big, friendly dog in a small room, and every time he swings his tail, he knocks down a chair.
I don't have a ticket.
The doctor works in the hospital.
Nothing's happened.
I baked an apple pie.
He's got a good reputation.
You'll be famous.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you coming soon?
Welcome to Tatoeba.
Everything's different.
What's your Bosnian name?
The truth must be told.
Look what it is!
We have to go shopping.
Tom's in the garage, working on his bike.
Is your car blue?
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
Tell me what it is.
Let's hope Tom's smart.
He lied to you.
How many mosques are there in Istanbul?
He was late because of the accident.
For breakfast, I always eat fruit and oatmeal.
You think I'm a dictator?
Who would want Tom dead?
Tom made it clear he didn't want to work for us.
I'm happy.
I'll stand.
We recommend that the water quality is checked once a year in the pipes, twice in the well.
Dear God, it is really hard for people when they have to draw your attention to one thing or another about you, your attitudes or your appearance, for example.
Don't be late.
What did you say?
Tom could have done better.
I'm sure they need you.
I feel like I've been thrown into a great void.
Do you agree?
Don't be afraid of barking dogs.
Are they still here?
He hadn't written to Mary in a long time.
This story tells us some interesting facts.
"Yes, orange juice, please," Mike said.
I'm not going with you.
You be careful.
Could I interrupt you for a moment?
I hate science.
The students did not know how to respond.
Do you have a book?
He has two cars.
If you don't bother them, they won't bother you.
Good intention is important.
I've already thought about it.
Men are children all their lives.
Stop trying to make me feel guilty.
Come on, admit it.
You and I are so different.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
The girls were asleep.
I'm just looking around.
Where is the beach?
You want to know something specific?
Welcome aboard.
We're not sure.
We don't have any food.
I'm tired. I'm tired.
You don't have to tell me twice.
Interoperability is compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not like that.
I have no idea.
Tom was seriously injured in the accident.
Two-thirds of the students were at the meeting.
My mother is not like other mothers.
He canceled the meeting at the last minute.
That can't be true.
"What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You open the door.
Oh, that's good.
Is that your new boyfriend?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why would you do that?
I hope you're not talking about me.
Don't give me that gun, I don't want to do that.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Have you seen my dog?
Tom told me he'd do it.
Look again.
Do you speak French?
I'm objective.
Nine out of ten voters think Maria is the best candidate for the new leader, but Tom is not going to vote in this election.
I bought flowers.
I'm sure you'll do just fine.
She's back from the hospital.
I probably won't read Tom's report.
I agreed to buy it.
He asked me to help him.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
What will happen now?
I brought a cup of coffee.
Make room.
He is also well known in Australia.
Someone called.
You be careful.
Winter is a time of snow.
Under what name?
What are you gonna do with Tom?
Good morning, how are you?
It's cold today.
My mother is Greek.
Be careful what you wish for, it might come true.
He's a third-year student.
Who's coming with us?
Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.
Who are you really?
How it came, how it went.
Give him time.
He who waits, waits.
I'll have to say, yes.
We've never been apart.
I'm 30.
Give me back my bottle.
I'm really happy to be here.
What the hell is wrong with you?
The doctor examined her thoroughly.
At that moment, it exploded with a big bang.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
More than 91 percent of Norway's population is supplied with drinking water from surface sources.
It's his, isn't it?
What's she drinking?
These are artificial tears.
Tom's very rude.
Don't forget to write the date.
She doesn't speak English.
Clean up this mess.
Could you have read that?
Try again.
That's perfectly normal.
How's your life going?
A new restaurant is said to have been built.
The price of this book is $5.
I want a sword like this.
Can you keep secrets?
Tell her.
I assumed you were busy.
Move quietly.
When the fire broke out, he was sleeping a lot.
My older sister sings well.
I never thought of that.
Her childhood illness blinded her.
Some friends can't be replaced.
Although the existence of this phenomenon is mere speculation, it is possible that in the future there will be evidence to support it.
Keep it down there.
He explained it in detail, but I still don't understand.
I'm from Croatia.
I want to eat some cheese.
He wouldn't like that.
I will have to change my habits.
I met your father yesterday.
I'm really curious.
Are you a man or a woman?
It's double parked.
Can you speak Latin?
Will you help me?
Good morning, how are you?
Are you sure you're ready for this?
Come back.
What are you gonna do with Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Everyone has the right to the protection of moral and material interests arising from any scientific, literary or artistic work of which he is the author.
Tom signed the bill.
There are islands in the sea.
I've never had a problem falling asleep.
Tom is hiding under the table.
I didn't see anything.
How many books can I take at once?
She went for a walk.
Are there any other options?
The amount for the work done and the interest on the invested capital was several million.
Champagne, please.
I can't wait for tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
You never know what will happen tomorrow.
I'm the one who's paying.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three of the boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I need a drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I don't completely agree with you.
Today's a nice day.
Are you saving this place for someone?
How are you these days?
You're a very beautiful woman.
I really think we women have an extra sense.
Sunday has seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about that.
Are you coming to Tom and Mary's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
Croatia is a country in the southeastern part of Europe.
I'll be back late.
You're a little liar.
The sea has risen, the sea of men.
I'll send a letter to my brother who lives in Sapporo.
The politician had sticky fingers, because 5% of every contract ended up in his pocket.
I'll stay with the baby if you want to go.
I don't read novels.
I thought it was my job.
I'm a teacher.
Tom said he wasn't an expert.
No, don't do that.
I asked him what he was reading.
There's no need to panic.
He didn't even hear Tom hate us.
I don't want any beans.
Where do you live?
It's been a long time since I sent anyone a letter.
What is the difference between imitation and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom turned off the engine.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
I was just thinking about you.
Don't fight.
Did you write the report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he had no choice.
Can you leave, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
American English is no better than British English.
Tom works about nine hours a day.
I hope I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
It's fair.
They couldn't hear what Tom had to say.
Why would I want to kill you all?
Tom decided to sell the car.
I'm gonna take a shower.
I'm happy.
It's mine, not his.
We have four French lessons every week.
Let's start now.
I can't imagine doing that.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
Fadil demanded that Dani give him the money.
Our only hope is ourselves.
I woke up on my left leg today.
He broke into my home.
The bathroom is upstairs.
She took care of her son.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It is a typical Gothic church.
It was a presentation that appealed to the audience.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do this.
Is this your notebook?
Somehow we survived.
Tom didn't exercise.
Thank you so much!
Keep the change.
It's 15:00.
I think you should do the test again.
Why would Tom give up?
The Europeans gained an advantage over other civilizations 500 years ago.
It seemed to me that Tom wasn't doing what he was supposed to be doing.
I'll pray for your family.
Tom chased the flies away.
He abruptly stopped smoking.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even the kids know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
Tom asked Mary to disprove what she said.
I have a cat and a dog. The cat is black and the dog is white.
Sarajevo is the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The cup's on the table.
That pisses me off a lot.
Is it still light outside?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
There's a lot of birds on the branch.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
Don't thank me.
I assumed you were busy.
Do you agree?
Would you like me to take a look at your house?
You have to control yourself.
What's the difference?
I recognized him at first sight.
The French are our friends.
That's very kind of you.
She looks like a Greek goddess.
You have to trust me.
If I love you, what does it matter to you?
I wish I'd thought of that.
I drink milk.
He managed to get into the house through the window.
I saw a cat.
She doesn't speak English.
I saw a cat.
It's snowing in Paris.
I hope Tom gets back safely.
I have no idea what was going on in his head to refuse such a favorable proposal.
I just got up.
How does it feel?
Can you make Tom laugh?
I'd better clean up now.
You tried.
My dog is blind, but likes to go out and walk.
Don't leave me alone.
- Wow!
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
He's tough or fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us ate a wiener with a potato salad.
Come alone.
To be a good kid, you need to go to bed and get up early.
Okay, how about you?
I'm thinking of going abroad.
I didn't tell you to do that.
Where are you from?
I promised.
My family goes to Italy every year.
It's not a simple sport.
Their friendship quickly turned into love.
Don't be a lezilebovic.
This is how it was supposed to be.
I eat a lot of meat.
I don't like to work.
Tom's a nerd.
The future looks bleak for Edmond Dantes, after becoming the victim of a conspiracy, he is convicted of treason and sent to prison for life.
You're irrational.
My French is shit.
We survived somehow.
She covered her disappointment with a smile.
My mother chose this curtain.
We're both not as rich as we'd like.
It stinks.
Can you let Tom know I stopped by?
She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
I'll give you the money tomorrow.
You need one of these.
Is he a teacher?
Can you cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned French myself.
I like to walk.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
I asked Tom to wake me up at 2:30.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his weak point.
You're one of us.
Faith can move mountains.
He has one foot in the grave.
Tom just told me the opposite.
Louder!
He was two years younger than me.
I'm sympathetic.
Tom's not happy.
That would be fun.
He's crazy as hell.
I'm sorry I didn't respond to your letter earlier.
Do not drink water from a dirty glass.
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I sang to you today were written by me.
That doesn't scare me in the least.
We didn't play well.
How old are you really?
Someone's here.
Tom asked me if I slept at all last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
Here's her picture.
How can I forget those days?
I'm thirsty.
A friend of mine is studying abroad.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.
Who's your favorite wrestler?
It's nice to meet you.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
This place looks very different from what it was before.
Is it yours?
Why Are Rabbits' Ears Big?
I'm a runner.
I don't sing.
Souls do not exist.
I want to help.
I know how to do that.
I shot a bear.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom's really an idiot.
Yes, sir.
Come and see us.
He lied to us.
That's quite a problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
I love this song.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to deal with things on the go.
You're working too hard.
This one's really cool.
Don't say a word.
I really enjoyed it.
You can trust that to a certain extent.
You're a teacher.
I bought a lot of stuff.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Kedah.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us a lot.
What do you believe in?
Sorry, I'm late for the meeting.
What we need is a responsible government, what we have is a circus.
I'm sorry for trying at all.
That river looks shallow, doesn't it?
I can keep a secret.
Tom helped me write this piece.
It's five o'clock in the morning in Brazil.
Tom hinted that Mary would do it.
Is this your phone?
We hate Tom.
This one's really cool.
Tom cut the tape.
Do you think the situation will improve?
- Who is she?
Tom was arrested three times.
This isn't so much fun.
That's a big secret.
Mary said she would reveal the secrets of all her bosses if they didn't raise her salary.
It's not taught in school.
Is it clear?
I can't get out tonight.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of there.
Fish cannot live outside the water.
I have a book.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
Stop resisting!
I'm cold.
I'm so busy, I can't help you.
I have two colors.
Come on, move it!
Please wait a little longer.
I'm not gonna do it!
I'm tired of fighting.
Are you a maniac?
How was your day?
What am I doing here?
They're good people.
She's a singer.
I love watching you guys play.
Good job!
I'm trying.
I was definitely lucky.
What's the first song you ever wrote?
Tom might be struggling.
I just want to get away.
Dania continued to follow Fadil's example.
A large number of words are borrowed from foreign languages.
I don't want you to get hurt.
I'm mad at Tom.
Every other day, Bill goes fishing.
Don't let a chance like this get away from you.
What time do you have breakfast?
You be careful.
He's in his first year of college.
I looked for grape juice.
I was thinking about my family.
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
Can you make Tom laugh?
Due to bad weather, the flight was delayed.
Can I have your dictionary?
My fluency in language is sufficient for many situations, but not for expressing my often contradictory emotions.
I was in a great mood.
I'm a professor.
There's nothing to do in this town.
Tom's a nerd.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book is on the shelf.
I often feel a throbbing of the heart.
Tom's undercover.
I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of snakes.
I know this girl from somewhere.
I nodded once.
Show me the photos!
She wanted to become a nurse.
I'm sorry to always bother you.
Tom's risking everything.
He's a man of power.
That's great!
I'm ticklish.
Can you pick us up?
Can you make it on time?
It's strange the postman hasn't arrived yet.
Try doing one thing at a time.
How do we prevent that from happening?
His novels are a favorite among young people.
There's a cat.
I hope Tom remembers this.
Was I really that happy?
I'm going to buy a boat soon, what kind of insurance should I choose?
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
She was surprised to hear the news.
He's not American, he's English.
How do you say “thank you” in Japanese?
There were no injuries.
You ever get a speeding ticket?
I'll be right up.
We've got to go.
Tom's a mechanic.
His death has taught me a lot.
Are we ready to go?
Why? Why?
The storm shouldn't affect our plans.
Tom is a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
There are no girls on the Internet.
She tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go out and walk.
Like most 18-year-olds, Tom isn't sure what he wants to do with his life.
Vivaldi wrote many pieces of music for the bassoon.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has broken his right femur in a bicycle accident in France.
Where there are many grandmothers, there are children.
Tom's as tense as a string.
Never lose hope.
Sounds simple, I know.
It was just icing on the cake.
How long has it been since you stopped teaching at that school?
Tom looked very confused.
The results were incredible.
Pick one.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember your name.
The brakes squeaked.
Have you fully recovered?
He got what he wanted.
I'll listen.
The job was already done.
Tom spoke very loudly.
She drinks like a sucker.
Don't move!
The accident was recorded by a cameraman.
Did I drop it?
Are you happy?
This is the stupidest thing I've ever said.
I wish I'd known Tom couldn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship turned into love.
There’s a saying in China that you can’t judge a man by his looks.
It's futile.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the right side is in New York.
They need each other.
What the fuck is going on here?
There are indications that the reception, which is known for its luxurious dishes, will be somewhat more modest this year.
Did you report it to the police?
He surrendered.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
What's the matter with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom does that.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Which way are you going?
I'm sorry if I disappointed you.
Violent criminals were often bullies in childhood.
Introduce me to Tom.
After much deliberation, I ended up making things at random.
You owe me a lot.
He's a man who saves words.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom came to my house for dinner last night.
Look how big it is!
The living truth.
You're very rude.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now is a great time to buy one.
You're absolutely right.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom came out of it.
He got involved with people he should never have gotten involved with.
Tom visits us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and write.
Tom is ruthless.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
It's a problem you have to solve on your own.
I was exaggerating.
Termites eat wood.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom dropped the book.
This should work.
You've let me down.
You don't have to judge a man by his looks.
It's disconnected.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for the e-mail!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
They'll be giving speeches tomorrow.
What the hell is this?
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I was going to be there.
Tom told me he wouldn't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
A team is as strong as its weakest member.
I've been there before.
So do I.
It's different than what I expected.
Don't lie.
Then what are your plans?
The kids are asleep.
That was very good.
You need a temporary bridge.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
This town, like many towns in England, has a fairly long history.
Tom closed the door.
I didn't have much fun, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.
Where's your stuff?
Tom worked very hard and spent a lot of money.
I don't like to socialize.
Tom's alone in the living room.
He lived a simple life.
We offered to help.
It was a dark and stormy night.
That smells delicious.
The first phase is finished.
You'll be famous.
He's got a lot of money, even more.
We're glad to have you here.
Can I have another glass of beer?
Tom was sure of himself.
Sit down for a moment, please.
It's Copacabana!
I wonder how Tom feels.
She's taking care of her old mother.
You're the most boring person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I have plants.
I bought a dozen pens today.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Is French taught in your school?
That can't be true.
Tom looked to the left and right before crossing the street.
Take a picture of this.
Who lives in the neighborhood?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom will recover.
You're important to me.
I don't expect anything from you.
Go straight.
You tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't get carried away.
I'm used to no one liking me.
The brakes creaked.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
Just like beans.
Now I'm a little worried.
Do you have a stable relationship with your boyfriend?
Tom still knows how to recite the song he wrote when he was thirteen.
It's empty.
Did you see Tom leave?
You be careful.
How would you translate that?
I'm willing to pay you well to do it.
Where did you get that idea?
What are you talking about?
It was a difficult decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you'd be busy.
A lot of people admire him.
I hope tomorrow will be a good day.
Maria nodded.
Let's sit.
Come take a look.
Tom really looks familiar.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
I'm out.
Do your kids have their own rooms?
Tom saved all the letters Mary sent him.
Why don't you go swim with Tom for a while?
She's safe.
Tom died in his sleep.
A woman's chiffon is not complete without a little black dress.
I can't sit still.
Finish this.
We have no choice but to kill.
Where's the bathroom here?
Happy Easter!
Tom helped me save a few dinars by telling me about a cheaper place to buy it.
I owe you an apology.
You can't do anything but admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom's been working his whole life.
Die!
Which way are you going?
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom.
I need to fix my watch.
Tom will live.
Please read between the lines.
You win!
That's a bad sign.
I got it wrong.
Tom had dinner with Mary.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I really that happy?
I'm good with kids.
I'll be late.
I had a quick lunch.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the highway.
You should leave Tom a message.
You're always lying to me.
Just in time!
I want what you want.
Health is wealth.
Now he has a family.
That doesn't surprise me.
As far as I know, he never got there in time.
Sweet dreams!
Someone needs to hire Tom.
Where did you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.
The boy throws a stone.
Can I call you back in 20 minutes?
Wind is a cheap and clean source of energy.
As little as we know about its origins, at least we can be sure it's an Evangelion pilot.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom got on the bus.
Can you leave us alone?
I almost forgot my passport.
Why are you doing this, if I may ask?
The deer is faster than the strong.
People used to write books with typewriters.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
I live in Sarajevo.
I reacted instinctively.
It's a toilet.
Tom sees nothing wrong with letting Maria learn to drive.
Are you coming back now?
I want to fuck you.
I hope not.
Give me one example.
How could I hate Tom?
Wear this.
How barbarous!
What day is tomorrow?
I've always known that.
Tom thought I was you.
I'm looking forward to your letter.
When the cat is gone, the mice go round the water.
We need that from Tom.
Japan is ruled by an emperor and Spain by a king.
It's Alice's book.
Are we going to see Tom again?
The world was on the brink of nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962.
Have fun while you can.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Are you dyslexic?
Melanie's drinking milk.
Where did you see Tom?
It's all quiet again.
I'm engaged.
Can we order please?
What does he do?
By the way, what's your address?
What I saw was depressing.
They were laughing at me.
I'm angry.
Take it easy, Tom.
Can you give an example?
I'm not going to Bust with you this weekend.
He stole a very valuable diamond ring.
That's my cat.
Tom drinks like a sucker.
Just like the good old days.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Is that what you want?
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't exaggerate.
Look at that.
We have your size, but not in that color.
That doesn't sound like you.
He's always here between 5 and 6 o'clock.
Tom was admitted to the hospital.
I hope I can do that.
I don't like stubborn people.
Sitting all day is bad for you.
The rainy season begins in June.
You always do.
That's perfectly normal.
You're out of luck, Tom.
The wall looked smooth and impenetrable.
Do you hear anything?
He's got two cars.
He'll probably still be angry.
He greeted us and left.
Welcome to Tatoeba.
I see, but I don't see.
I'm bleeding.
I'm glad you answered.
We're close friends.
We can't be friends anymore.
In the future, many workers will be replaced by robots.

My phone's about to go dead.
Tom convinced Mary to invite John to the party.
Wait, what are you trying to do?

Shoot your feet!
"Are you serious?" "I'm serious."
Why are you mad at me?
I'd prefer a morning check-up.

She's honest.
Who's running the meeting today?
How did you find out where Tom is?
You're not rational.
These are my best friends.
It doesn't work for me.
Give me a day or two.

Dan is a linguist.
I wouldn't hurt her.
This is a book.
At this stage of world history. In America there is no such thing as an independent press. You know it and I know it. Among you there is no one who dares to write his honest opinion, and if he wrote it, but in advance he would know that it will never appear in the press. I get paid on a regular basis to keep my honest opinion out of the newspapers for which I work. Many of you are also like him.
I'm not at all worried.
The bedroom is upstairs.
It's mine, not his.
I could use some help.

Only I can do that here.

If you're going out, please close the door.
I can't believe I forgot.

What are you gonna do with all that money?
You'll probably never see me again.
The Milky Way is a vast band of distant stars similar to our sun.
Who's that?

I'm so excited.
I invited him.

You changed my life.
Can I take your dictionary?

It's my fault.
Who wants to talk to me?
Bring backup.
He was two years younger than me.
We just got here today.
Come stay with me.

Are you going back now?
My name is Hashimoto.
It's comfortable.
He lost hope and killed himself with poison.
You were spying on me.
It's night, family dinner.
Better late than never.
We'll never go back there.
Are we going home?
And if I was rich, I wouldn't give him the money.
I made a mistake this morning.
You can do better than that.
Is it all settled now?
Have you seen my houses?
Stay calm.
One day it will be mine.
I have a few friends.
Give Tom a drink.
I've had enough!
He went on despite her displeasure.

I agreed to buy it.
Can you come?
Yes or no?

I never lend books or CDs to anyone.
That was kind of weird.

Under what name?
Why don't you take your coat off?

I'll go if you go.
Are you on Facebook?
Okay, how about you?

Either way, you're wrong.
The redheads are driving me crazy!
I'm not angry at all.
A man has many desires that he does not even want to realize, and it would be wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only desires; they have value only in his imagination; their realization would be a bitter disappointment for him. Such a desire is also the desire for eternal life. If it were fulfilled, a man would also want to be completely sick.
Let me sleep another ten minutes.
