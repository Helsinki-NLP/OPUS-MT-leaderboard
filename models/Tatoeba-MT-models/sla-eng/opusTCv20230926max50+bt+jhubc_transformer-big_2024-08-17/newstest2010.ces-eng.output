Barack Obama will receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. president.
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. president in history.
He will receive a diploma, a medal and a check for $1.4 million, among other things, for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The head of the White House will arrive in the Norwegian capital in the morning with his wife Michelle and will be busy.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with five members of the committee, which selected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The pair are scheduled to meet with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremony at which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president, but only the third to receive the award directly from the office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will speak about the Afghan war when accepting the award.
The president does not want to avoid this topic because he realizes that he is taking the prize as a president who is currently fighting in two countries.
He increased the war effort a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which will not forget to highlight any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He plans to give them to charity, but has not yet decided on a specific charity.
The packed program will then take the president to a banquet, where, in addition to the Norwegian king and queen, there will also be a prime minister and another 250 invited guests.
From the beginning, Obama has been rather cautious about the price.
He said, for example, that he felt that he did not fully deserve it.
He also reiterated several times that this is not just a prize for him, but for all who strive for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he said it was a "call to action".
Environmentalist Accused of Extortion
Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police accused the chairman of the civic association Society of Nature Conservation Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice of extortion.
In several cases in the past year, he appealed to some construction proceedings, demanding money from investors for his benefit, Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police spokeswoman Alena Romová said.
The president of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Society of Nature Conservationists is Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is now in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
Sorting containers of Brno do not smell much
In Prague, ordinary people can sort packaging from drinks, in the South Moravian villages you will meet sorting containers at every step.
And in Brno?
There to reserve a few minutes until you find a suitable garbage can.
I don’t want to say that there is no waste at all in Brno.
But it seems to me that the fact that we are the second largest city in the republic, the councillors are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the forest league of waste sorting not only by the fact that as citizens we can still throw only paper, glass and plastics into sorting containers, but above all by the number of garbage cans for such waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a PET bottle in the trash?
It's a done deal, it just takes time and nerves.
The only place I've come across so far is on Moravské nám<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> opposite Potrefené Husa.
Don't make Mr. Onderka and his colleagues mad at me, but it doesn't seem like much.
Not to mention that there is no honey in other parts of the waste sorting.
A lot of my friends don't like that sort of waste.
Laziness.
It’s far from garbage.
I don't blame them.
After the party, I offered to throw away some glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colored trash cans in sight on Kounicova Street.
Fortunately, I found the right place on the way to the salina.
However, the waste from it overflowed.
After all, this is still the center of Brno, which perhaps the city represents the most, right?!
But the ecology and some aesthetics of the Brno socialists are not very interested.
They would rather buy the city an extra-hockey league that would embarrass us all over the country than buy a few more containers and offer to sort out other raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption after a moment of browsing on the Internet with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM data, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravian Region.
"Paroubk's" budget took money for pensions and sick leave
After the left has added, despite the government’s opinion, to farmers or officials, there may not be money in the budget for pensions, sick pay or building savings.
But also on interest on the national debt or on international litigation.
This will cause problems for those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists pushed for an increase in some groups, they relied on borrowing from the government for sensitive expenses, pensions or sickness benefits. "It's just putting off problems into the future, laying mines," Janota says.
Borrowed money pays higher and higher interest rates and sometimes has to be repaid.
The state has no choice where to take it.
If it does not reduce social benefits or the running costs of the state, it must raise taxes.
To all whom the left has now added: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later their children.
People don’t have to worry about pensions or sick pay, 1.8 billion of which have disappeared from their accounts.
However, at the cost of more debt – next year will not be missing in the coffers of only 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow faster and faster, and with it the interest costs.
The state will need money to pay for it, and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity, as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
Due to the transfer of money in favor of several groups of voters, next year there will also be a lack of five billion for the completion of highways and railways.
These are mainly already competitive and under construction sections, which can not be redesigned and, if necessary, can not be reduced.
Save at most, which is also not free.
It means delaying or stopping thirty large buildings, as well as the drawing of European money, warns transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD proposed that the loss of money would be resolved in Solomonic terms – it would reach out to the dividends of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which the state mostly owns, and pour them into the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain, and especially not a bottomless source.
Last year, <0xC4><0x8C>EZ added 18 billion to the budget.
Every year, the dividends are used to liquidate environmental damage, supplement the pension account or serve as a reserve for the upcoming pension reform.
Moreover, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7% of GDP under EU rules.
But the carnival does not end there.
Almost three billion was spent on various compensations for victims of communism and crimes, or on expenses for litigation, even for building savings.
Whether the state can do without this money is uncertain.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we will have to pay for it anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save money inside the ministry or, in the worst case, reach out to the government budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing for the already launched two-billion-dollar project of the State Treasury, which is to allow online monitoring of what individual authorities spend.
The first phase will start in January.
If the finance minister did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, sanctions would come, Janota warns.
Your next smartphone will be able to handle two operating systems
In the future, Americans are counting on a mobile phone, on which the user will switch between different operating systems at the touch of a button.
The revealed plans are promising.
Just press one key and you can transfer from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
This option is aimed at the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles on your mobile phone at the same time.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
Both will work at the same time, VMware’s Srinivas Krishnamurti said in an interview with Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and a few days ago it was presented for the first time.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM, on which the aforementioned Windows Mobile and Android systems were running side by side.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and U.S. operators to test smartphone virtualization, and the devices are expected to reach customers in 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
The bare slopes are not only of concern to the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e lifters.
The lack of snow also discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That is why there are still available rooms in the Giant Mountains for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a large number of visitors to our site.
People go through the offers, find out the prices, but so far they are afraid to order bindingly.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas will be on snow or on mud," Spindl.Info news portal operator Martin Jandura said.
Those who want a New Year's Eve stay in Spindleruv Mlyn exactly as they wish should not hesitate to order.
Whoever prefers to save money and the quality of accommodation is in second place, he can still try to wait a few days.
Spindleruv Mlyn hoteliers offer mostly one-week stays on New Year's Eve.
I think they're going to try to turn them in for a while, but then they're going to let go and go for a shorter period of time.
And then the free rooms will quickly decrease," Jandura estimated.
The Vrchlabi travel agency Ingtours also offers free beds in all winter dates.
This is the most important part of the Christmas season, which has not yet sold out.
Half of the seats in our offer are still available.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper last-minute Christmas stays," said Ingtours Director Petr Schiefert.
New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains can also offer a Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD> travel agency, but there are fewer vacancies.
The first fourteen days of February are also good for sales, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays has a negative impact on the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for him to attack.
No one wants to spend the rest of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy during the week, Christmas will also be sold out," Schiefert said.
On the contrary, the rooms of the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou are a bit better than last year.
We're about five percent better.
We have the last few places for New Year's Eve and Christmas.
There is a great interest in the Polish holidays in January and it sells well even in February," said the director of the best hotel in the Czech Republic, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of New Year's Eve stays are occupied by the Omnia Hotel near the central parking lot in Janské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B>.
On the contrary, at Christmas, half of the beds are still available in the newest Janské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B> hotel.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by January, which is already occupied by about sixty percent.
February is a little weaker so far, but as soon as the snow sets in, interest in staying in the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e Mountains will certainly increase, said the director of the Omnia Hotel Erik Sporysch.
However, for a larger amount of snow, Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e hoteliers still have to let go of the taste.
It is supposed to cool down on Thursday, if there is any precipitation, the mountains should be snowy.
But then the warming is to come again, said Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> from the Hradec Králové office of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is comical how schoolboy Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of being the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself considered the stupidest, on the Afghan issue.
When he finally sweated out his much-anticipated Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he had copied it from Bush’s Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only did he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, but he did not even hesitate to use the title of Bush's January 2007 statement as the title of his own declaration: "A New Way Forward."
Three years ago, he himself criticized Bush’s idea of sending fresh military reinforcements to civil war-torn Iraq as an “irresponsible and disastrous decision.”
The months that followed, however, showed that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of the field commanders, was the only possible and successful one, so much so that there is no talk of Iraq in the news reports today.
It did not improve Bush’s reputation, but objectively left his successor a much more grateful starting position than might have been expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will happen again.
He was again asked to increase the military contingent by field commanders, in particular the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who, even despite the subordination habits, harshly criticized the hesitant shooters in the White House.
He asked for 40,000 men so he could break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he could not think of anything better, so at least he deceived the general by 10,000 soldiers.
He was able to squeeze out of Europe the promise of another 5,000, although he himself originally counted on at least 10.
The most problematic of all Obama’s strategy seems to be his intention to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in as little as 18 months and end the process within three years. The entire Obama Doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that a half-increase will yield the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders honoring agreements.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the opposite symptom - no one can be trusted and no agreements are being kept.
Under these conditions, the Afghan security forces are preparing poorly, accustomed to changing the master every day according to how it suits them.
The political institutions, even if formally established, will remain only a village of obscurity, behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to flourish.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely difficult given the opacity of the situation, which is further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even building an "accessible state", which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation, does not seem too real.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy strikes with its voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the verge of an explosion.
To believe that the soldiers sent into the war turmoil for the purpose of "soon returning home" will cause a miracle done here, can only be a truly romantic soul, untouched by reality.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is a sheer irresponsibility, as the Taliban will perceive it as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit has shown that the willingness of Europeans to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is declining.
European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically interfering in the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, the difficult question before the United States is whether to try to solve the problem by military force.
It will need to be answered at a time when, according to Obama, America will embark on a victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will also mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left until the presidential election, and therefore enough time left for him to come up with another strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs managers will no longer receive cash rewards
Senior executives at Goldman Sachs will not receive cash rewards this year.
This was announced by the company, which reacts to sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers will receive shares instead of money, which can be sold no earlier than in five years.
In addition, shares can be taken away from managers if they take excessive risks.
Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street rewards with long-term performance, according to Reuters.
“I think Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to take,” said Douglas Elliott, a former investment banker at JPMorgan.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has been the target of criticism after spending nearly $17 billion (almost CZK 300 billion) on rewards in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of remuneration in the company for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed $ 20 billion, despite the announced measure today.
High remuneration in the banking sector has become a hot political topic in many countries with the advent of the financial crisis.
Britain announced on Wednesday that bankers’ bonuses in excess of <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 (<0xC2><0xA3>712,000) will be taxed at 50%.
France is taking similar steps.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics.
A record five women today in Stockholm took over from the hands of Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf this year's Nobel Prize in professional categories and literature.
In addition to the four scientists, there was a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak, for their research in the field of chromosomes.
Ada Jonath, along with Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, was awarded the Chemistry Prize for explaining the structure and function of ribosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for their analysis of economic governance.
The only professional category that went without a holder this year was physics.
Charles Kao for his research in optical fibers and George Smith for his invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines and astronomical telescopes.
Each recipient received a diploma, a Nobel medal and a certificate of financial reward.
For each category, it amounts to ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 25 million CZK).
If there is more than one reward in each of them, the reward is divided among them.
The most widely anticipated Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to President Barack Obama in Oslo, Norway.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his awards, as he is only at the beginning of his career and, moreover, stands at the head of a country that is waging two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In his defense of his policy, he added that wars are necessary in a certain situation to achieve peace, although the price for this is high.
Minister Janota is considering resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduardo Janota on Friday morning, who is considering staying in the government because he does not agree with the form of the state budget for next year as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is expected that the budget and possibly Janot’s stay in the cabinet will be the topics of their Friday meeting.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too high, which further aggravates the crisis of public finances.
The meeting was reported by the president's spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to hold talks with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget law, which Klaus will now get to sign, the Czech Republic should manage a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
But on Wednesday, the House approved proposals from the left to move money and raise money for civil servants’ salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the proposals of social democracy for secretly increasing the budget deficit.
This has led to a sharp internal political dispute between the left on one side and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, which is starting to raise questions about the further functioning of Fischer’s office, the formation of which was agreed upon by the ODS, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Green Party in the spring.
Critics argue that the budget, as adopted by the House, essentially liquidates the austerity package that the Fischer government pushed through in the fall, which it says is meant to stop government debt.
Klaus, who may or may not sign the bill, said at a business breakfast discussion today that politicians have been neglecting the "serious problem" of "unsustainable deficits" of public finances for a long time.
He no longer has a good solution.
Only a strong government could bring improvement, which could also rely on a broader consensus of political parties, the president said.
ODS Chairman Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is frightening and the government should consider further existence.
ODS Deputy Chairman Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer called similar words “strong statements.”
The head of the CSSD, Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek, responded to Topolánek by saying that the budget deficit, which the former Topolánek government has prepared for this year and which will exceed CZK 200 billion, is frightening.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD called the approval of the state budget for next year a success.
The people were also pleased.
Clint Eastwood as Morgan Freeman
South Africans say the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Undefeated, will tell the world a lot about the country, its struggles and victories, despite some criticisms that the main roles are played by American actors.
The story is about sports, race, and Nelson Mandela.
A tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his life story by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91, asked if he could play him in Eastwood's film.
Matt Damon plays a major role in it.
I told him, 'If I play you, I'm going to have to have access to you.
The 72-year-old actor, who won the award for his role in Eastwood’s Million Dollar Baby, has portrayed, for example, the leader of the abolitionist movement, who eventually became a slave, a fictional U.S. president and even a god in God’s Evan, but rarely someone as alive and as important to many as Man.
A former South African statesman has been jailed for 27 years for his active work in ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is the Latin word for undefeated and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film is a true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. Newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation is still racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players, who are among the outsiders on a global scale.
The South African team will eventually advance to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring Mandela's story to the screen.
I had no other goal than to play this role so as to bring it as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would try to meet with Mandela, dine with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that when I shook your hand, I took your energy, it transferred, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon stars in Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team dominated by white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rugby.
A big surprise for him in the end was when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember ringing the doorbell, he opened it and the first thing I said to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar in my life was, ‘I look much bigger in a movie.’
Despite the obvious differences in the characters of the actors compared to their real counterparts under the direction of director Eastwood, Invictus: Undefeated received positive reviews and there is talk of ambitions for an Oscar.
Film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment in the words: "It was a very good story, a very well made film."
In film reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The secret of the glow over Norway deciphered: the Russians tested the rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin could be observed over Norway.
Russia's Defense Ministry said it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
But the launch was again unsuccessful, and the missile referred to as the "Bulava" type, which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming a black moth of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence during the missile tests did not have the appropriate effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava usually did not take off at all or was damaged in the air.
The Russian newspaper called Bulava a “rocket that doesn’t fly.”
A rocket that does not fly but shines
The 13th attempt was normal at first.
It was not until the end of the flight that the technical damage to the apparatus occurred again.
The engine must have exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time the Bulava was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows firing from a vessel that is in motion and at the same time submerged.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unspecified flying object was indeed broken "Bulava".
After all, the Norwegians from the first moment did not doubt that it was a Russian missile.
This time, the generals defend themselves and say that it is impossible to speak unequivocally about failure.
The first two stages of the rocket survived, and the accident affected up to the third.
In previous cases, the engines failed in the first stage.
Although not a single test launch was carried out without an error, the leadership of the Ministry of Defense considers only six out of thirteen to have failed.
The almost 50 percent success rate is therefore optimistic for the generals, and so they still claim that Bulava will one day fly without problems and that it will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed a one-year contract at CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will again perform in a professional hockey match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup winner will help his CSKA Moscow team in an emergency and will probably play in Friday’s KHL match against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov, who retired at the age of 40 in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kulja<0xC5><0xA1> was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov regularly trains and agreed to help the team.
We just need to finalize some formal requirements, said Sergei Nemchinov, the head coach of the Moscow club.
It is not yet clear whether the return of the famous hockey player will concern only one match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of other players, said N<0xC4><0x9B>m<0xC4><0x8D>inov.
Fetisov will become Russia’s oldest professional hockey player if he returns to the ice.
At the age of 51, he played for the legendary forward Gordie Howe in the NHL for the entire season for Hartford, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship titles, won the Canada Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected successes in the NHL, where he lifted the Stanley Cup twice in Detroit.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai has complied with the unions. Cancel all overtime
The management of the No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice car manufacturer Hyundai has agreed with the unions to abolish all overtime.
It was precisely because of the often-ordered overtime that the unions declared a strike standby on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai spokesman Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k.
However, the management wants to agree with the unionists on another Saturday shift this year.
We cannot resign to our production plan, which is crucial, so it was proposed to volunteer overtime on Saturday, December 19, with two shifts, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
The server Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz wrote that the company of employees who work Saturday’s shift offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
People will get it back on Saturday, November 28th.
According to Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, the company decided to change the way employees are motivated for the proposed overtime.
They either pay the overtime surcharge or they can choose a substitute holiday on December 28, and thus extend the Christmas holidays by one day, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift will receive paid fares and lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and burning point in terms of comments and complaints of trade unionists, as well as protesting employees, who last week spontaneously stopped production, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Until last week, the employees of the car company were forced to work two more hours of overtime every day after an eight-hour shift.
After the signing of the agreement, the unions will call off the strike standby
Further negotiations between the management of the car company and the trade unions are scheduled to take place on Friday morning.
Trade union chief Petr Kuchar said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike standby.
The situation in the carmaker escalated last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to constant overtime.
They also protested against poor wage conditions and alleged bullying.
The management objected that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements for car deliveries.
Trade unionists also demanded in Monday's announcement of strike readiness that no sanctions be imposed on employees who stopped production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, unions are demanding that the company reduce overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay a reward of 5,000 crowns for it this year.
The Hyundai Motor Company currently employs 2,000 people.
The company began mass production in November last year.
By September this year, it had produced about 80,000 cars, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that affects even the 'complaints' of HIV
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that have already gained immunity against drugs.
This fact in some cases outweighs the fact that the compound does not act as strongly as some already available drugs on a common variant of the virus.
AIDS is not yet curable.
However, patients can significantly prolong the life of a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of HIV in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
In addition, the incomplete suppression of virus multiplication results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which drugs are already ineffective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, V<0xC5><0xA0>CHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metallocarborans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metal carboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way than all drugs used today, and therefore can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, the researchers come up with new ‘improved’ compounds prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viral protein.
Metal carboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages made of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Traitorous and Resistant Virus
HIV protease is an HIV protein that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by HIV cleavage, no mature infectious viral particles would arise.
If we stop HIV protease, we will also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, scientists explain in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cells (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
Slightly weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of anti-HIV proteases was tested in a test tube and also against its resistant variants obtained from patients infected with HIV.
The effect of metallocarboranes on the normal variant of the enzyme is not as strong as with clinically used drugs, but does not lose its effect for resistant variants against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical modifications from metal carboranes, make them interesting compounds for further research aimed at the design of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na <0xC5><0x98>ezá<0xC4><0x8D>ová, Head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology at the Institute of Organic Chemistry.
The dispute over the budget. ODS went to Fischer, he defends himself
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek called the approved budget for next year "terrifying" and said the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider further existence.
The statement of the ODS was described by the Prime Minister as strong statements.
He said he has time for analysis.
ODS Deputy Chairman Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Green Party is clearly no longer working.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on a minority in the House to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of ODS and social democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as pointed out.
The House passed the 2010 budget on Wednesday, but with left-wing amendments worth more than 12 billion crowns.
The House increased money for civil servants’ salaries, for the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government’s objection to the proposals of social democracy was that they were secretly increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
Before the vote, the ODS left the hall, having complied with the government’s wishes, so that even the amended budget is a less bad option than the budget provisional.
Disappointment and futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government would still assess the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to leave office in the event of the adoption of amendments, the situation could look different.
According to Czech TV, Janota has ordered a visit to the prime minister on Monday after the government.
He said he was considering staying in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer calls for a further fight against the budget deficit, according to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD nominees, who pushed the budget changes, have nothing to do in the government.
The prime minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House approves other bills that increase the deficit, such as those related to sickness benefits, pensions, or a service law amendment.
Topolánek: ODS-nominated ministers not guilty
This is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ODS-nominated ministers did nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in a text message from the US.
He recalled that in several ministries there are people in deputy positions who are in favor of TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign on the principle of combating the deficit of public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct to rely on the left majority that is currently in the House."
But then he says he cannot count on the support and tolerance of the civic democrats.
I did not think about it, and when it is up to date, I will deal with it, Defence Minister Martin Barták, who was nominated to the government by the Civic Democrats, told reporters in the Chamber.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels for the European Council this afternoon.
At the request of the Prime Minister, he resigned.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as also stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies if the Prime Minister did not explicitly ask the Civic Democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he responded to the question whether the ODS was burdened by the absence of the party leader in the parliament and the Czech Republic during the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't notice my voice was missing.
Even when I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be primarily about the bolshevization of the House and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new order, <0xC4><0x8C>D will take fewer trains for almost the same fare
Starting from December 13, Czech Railways will cancel or reduce some less busy express trains and local buses, while other connections will be strengthened.
From the date of the new timetable, the total transport volume will be reduced by two percent compared to today.
Most fares, including basic and customer fares, will not change.
For example, the inhabitants of Ostrava will get more possibilities of connection to the capital, the railways will add one set of pendolinos to this line.
On the other hand, the high-speed train stops going to Bratislava.
Fewer express trains will also run on the Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line, and direct connections between Prague and Letohrad will be significantly reduced.
Of the regions, the railways plan the largest reduction in traffic in the Hradec Králové Region, by a total of eight percent, while Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice route are also cancelled and the operation of several express trains on the Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line is limited to some days of the week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, today the Milovices have to transfer to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of the suburban Esko system, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance connections to the capital will end at the Prague Main Railway Station.
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jesenik will run at two-hour intervals.
From 13 December, passengers will no longer be able to travel by Pendolin to Bratislava.
This year's regional railway bill: 200 million more
The rapids are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, the total amount of the so-called demonstrable losses will be four billion crowns next year, just as this year. Locals order the regions, they will pay eight billion crowns for them next year, and the state will contribute less than three billion crowns to the regions.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For locals and express trains have a newly concluded ten-year contract, so far the contract has always been for one year.
The tracks praise the system, and therefore apparently did not raise the prices of the vast majority of tickets.
Changes will only occur with one-day network tickets <0xC4><0x8C>D Net and cheap internet tickets eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net will increase from CZK 450 to CZK 600.
The price of the eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will depend on the distance traveled, so far it has been uniform for travel between any regional cities and amounted to 160 crowns.
Philippine Militants Still Detain More Than 50 People, Release Children
Militants have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines, including several elementary school students and their teachers.
This was reported by the AFP agency, which initially reported only 65 kidnapped.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Some 19 militants are said to be using hostages as human shields as they flee from police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree on the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the militants belong to the New People’s Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the Associated Press, police initially harassed the abductor for violence that required settling accounts between two local family clans.
In the southern Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, martial law was declared due to the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the gubernatorial elections were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippine province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family, were arrested on suspicion of participating in the massacre.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But on Tuesday, they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government.
The story of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (the official title in Czech is Invictus: Undefeated) is coming to American cinemas, capturing part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter was played by Morgan Freeman, whom he said he had chosen Mandela for his portrayal years ago.
The supporting male role of the legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar was played by Matt Damon.
With the release of the film in cinemas arise from the responses of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela 's
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
He was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in 1988 and the Nobel Peace Prize with de Klerk in 1993.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
Expectations are high, as it comes to the public at a time when preparations for the World Cup are in full swing in South Africa, but at the same time the media is shaken by worrying reports of growing racial hatred and discrimination against the population by the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the response to the new film in South Africa so far has been largely positive, despite numerous objections to the cast of the main roles of the "flooded" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of his new film.
I have dreamed about this role for many years and was well prepared for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela many times in person to – as they say – draw his energy, he said in an interview after the premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if we can remember Mandela's personality and message with the film.
It’s the story of South Africa, but it concerns every person, he added.
In the jersey of the national rugby team
The film is based on a book by British writer John Carlin with the freely translated title In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that gave rise to the nation portrays a South African human rights defender during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman tries to unite two racial and for many years mutually demarcated groups of the population in the course of the film and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also enters the role of an actor in the South African national rugby jersey on the World Cup field, which was won by South Africa at that time.
For entering the lawn in a jersey that is seen as almost sacred in South Africa, Mandela received a big ovation from a predominantly white audience fourteen years ago and won the recognition of the white population.
A football championship may be able to reunite people into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve remains to be seen.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as, for example, in a recent interview with LN revealed rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain.
The championship will begin on June 11, 2010.
A transformer burns in Lounsko for tens of millions of crowns
In the morning, a transformer of the <0xC4><0x8C>eps company caught fire in a substation near the village of V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov in the Lounsko region.
According to Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, a spokesman for the regional fire department in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, six units are involved in the fire.
Initially, the firefighters wanted to burn the transformer, but later they reconsidered their opinion and the fire was extinguished with a mixture of water, foam and special extinguishing agents.
The cause was a technical fault, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured, according to company spokesman Pavla Mandátová, the accident does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, it will be possible to accurately quantify it only after the fire.
According to Mandate, the destroyed transformer will need to be replaced with a new one.
In the ten years of <0xC4><0x8C>eps’ operation, nothing similar has happened, defects of this type are rare, she added.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>EZ’s spokesperson for Northern Bohemia, Sonia Hollingerová Hendrychová, the electricity supply was not interrupted, and the operation of households, offices and companies was not affected by the fire.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps operates on the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive operator of the transmission system, power lines 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 substations with 67 transformers transferring electricity from the transmission system to the distribution system and a 4,339-kilometre-long route.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura will file a criminal complaint for defamation against three <0xC4><0x8C>SSD governors
Student Agency owner Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura will file a criminal complaint today for defamation against three Social Democratic governors.
This is on Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek from the South Moravian Region, Radko Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nek from the Pardubice Region and Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, the Governor of the Olomouc Region.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura stated this in Twenty Minutes of Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál.
The lawsuit relates to the company’s efforts to operate regional train services in some regions.
However, all regions eventually signed long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three governors attack us and talk about choosing raisins, while we brought an offer only for what they wanted.
He claims that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the prices of the Czech Railways, which were closed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
It's for defamation of the Student Agency, he told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
At the same time, he said that he has evidence from all regions that they did not take their actions in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an initiative for the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers the filing of a criminal complaint to be a continuation of Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s media show, which serves as an unpaid advertisement for his companies and his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend the good name of my country and my country, and to do the same I will call on the other governors.
I suppose that even on this occasion it will be clear that it is Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura who is manipulating the public in the matter of regional rail transport and using false and false arguments, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura announced last week that it will invest several million crowns in advertising, which will draw attention to the unfavorable step of the regions.
He told the radio magazine that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and want to continue it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will be directed against corruption.
The campaign was launched by Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura after the regions agreed to operate regional railway connections with the Czech Railways and tenders for the order of around CZK 150 billion were not issued.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, such behaviour is illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ur has already been threatened by an MP for the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD because of his criticism of train transport in the regions.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know which gentleman he is, I will not say his name, he told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococcal disease from January will break the established habits.
It should be the first for families free of charge and at the same time optional.
However, there are already reports that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are in full swing.
The Institute of Medicine already sets maximum prices for vaccines to be paid by health insurance companies.
Experts are already clear on the vaccination process.
New Vaccination
Vaccinations Free for August Children
From January onwards, children born on or after 2 August can be vaccinated against pneumococcal disease free of charge.
The condition is that they have not yet received a single dose of the vaccine.
Anyone who started the vaccine last year or earlier must pay for the next revaccination.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between 3 and 5 months of age.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily had their children vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns for one dose or more.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate the youngest children.
In total, experts estimate that health insurance companies will spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns per year on vaccinations.
But it will save on the treatment that children without vaccinations would need.
So far, the state has given about 500,000 per year for all area vaccinations of children.
The so-called Janot package was introduced as a paid vaccination.
Pneumococcal causes otitis media, but also serious infections including inflammation of the brain membranes and blood poisoning.
According to the survey, up to 28 children under the age of 10 will die from pneumococcal infections in our country in a year.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they have introduced paid area vaccination of children against pneumococcal disease in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are opinions that this vaccination may be mandatory in the future.
From January, it should be covered by insurance companies and optional.
The fact that compulsory vaccination would be better, for example, was suggested by the head of the civic association Nazlas, Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
His association has long promoted the pneumococcal vaccine.
Experts at the international conference that our association participated in were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccinations.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we managed to achieve at least this.
I think that’s the path we have to take now, Kalovsky said.
The Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcal disease.
At the moment, we do not think about it at all, his spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>en said.
Voluntary Vaccination Has Its Disadvantages, Doctors Say
Hana Cabrnochová, President of the Society of Pediatric Practitioners, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, a reduction in the number of booster shots could be considered. "In a situation where this vaccine costs such a high amount, we quite understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as voluntary," Cabrnochová says.
Experts expect that more than 80 percent of new parents will have their infants vaccinated against pneumococcal disease by next year.
Vaccination against pneumococcal disease is a breakthrough in the fact that it is paid for by health insurance companies, not the state, as the first area vaccination of children.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, thus saving on further treatment, Cabrnochová explains.
Doctors will have to buy the drugs themselves.
However, this is related to the concerns of practical children's doctors, which are related to the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines should be purchased by insurance companies, and doctors would receive them in the same way as the state supplies them with substances for other vaccinations.
However, some MPs feared that this would allow insurance companies to "withdraw money from health insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the substances and wait for the insurance companies to pay them back.
It is estimated that individual GPs will invest 40,000 per month in vaccines, which is a significant amount.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnoch.
The son of an American artist 'stolen in a museum'
The son of renowned American science fiction author Frank Frazetta has been charged with attempting to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father’s museum.
Police in Pennsylvania said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
The named Mr. Frazetta and the second man used an excavator to break into a museum in the Poconco Mountains region.
Frazetta Sr., 81 years old, is famous for creating the characters of Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time, the artist was in Florida, according to the Associated Press.
The Associated Press quoted an unnamed police official as saying Mr Frazetta Jr. could have been motivated by long-running family disputes.
Mr Frazetta made a junior sworn statement before the police, aged 52, that he did so at the direction of his father, "to get into the museum in any way possible and move the paintings to the malt rooms," the agency said.
Mr Frazetta, a senior, denied granting any such authorisation, as the agency said.
Labour opposes planned tax hikes
The ministers advocated tax increases and spending cuts announced in the preliminary budget report against criticism from the opposition, entrepreneurs and trade unions.
According to Alistair Darling, the Tories “lost” the opportunity to show that they are serious about postponing the decision to reduce the deficit until after the election.
Even the chancellor came under fire for the disability of low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, this is mainly an increase of 0.5% in social insurance and 1% in the adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Anger over Social Security
Unions protested that low-income workers were punished for a recession they did not blame and warned in advance of "problems".
Social security is on the rise – an increase of around <0xC2><0xA3>3 trillion a year – which has outraged the community of entrepreneurs who have said it is an employment tax while there should be a focus on rebuilding the economy.
This increase, limited to these revenues of more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 a year, will affect some 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS PBR
Social security will increase by another 0.5% from April 2011
The economic situation will worsen more than expected, by 4.75% this year
New tax on 50% of bankers’ bonuses
1% increase in corporate tax on write-offs for small businesses
Tax cuts for electric vehicles and wind farms
Increase in the calculation of pensions by 2.5%
According to the estimate of the state financial administration, some income of <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will be reduced by <0xC2><0xA3>90 a year, and some income of <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will be reduced by <0xC2><0xA3>190, while some income of <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 will be increased by <0xC2><0xA3>110.
Ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 meant "complicated decision-making", but insisted that 60% of special taxes should go to the top 5% of people with the highest incomes.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms denied that the proposed tax hikes and spending cuts would be a “drop in the ocean” compared to what would have to be done.
"These are big numbers, which will allow us to cut the deficit in half, which is an absolutely basic requirement for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he was confident the economy would grow at the turn of the year.
But drawing up a forecast for future economic growth — which will affect the volume of loans needed and how quickly the deficit will be reduced — must be taken into account after the chancellor was forced to revise past amounts.
In a strong opinion he said the economy’s decline this year was 4.75% – far worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April – as loans were <0xC2><0xA3>3 trillion higher than previously estimated.
A wasted opportunity.”
The Conservatives, who launched a new campaign on Thursday warning of a “debt crisis” for Labour, called the planned <0xC2><0xA3>789 trillion loan over the next six years intolerable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how this could be paid for, added, "cynically" postponing this decision until after the elections - which must take place by June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant that was feasible," shadow finance minister Philip Hammond said. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they wasted it."
“All important announcements will be made after the election if we win it.”
by Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, in contrast to proposals by the Tories, who would like to reduce the deficit faster and to a greater extent.
But liberal Democrats argue that the money raised by tax hikes and spending cuts should be used to support spending next year, not to reduce the deficit, and argue that the plans are “built on sand.”
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson said the timing of the announcement – for example, inflation will rise and there will be an inability to pay benefits next April – could lead to the chancellor being accused of campaigning if the money is difficult to get back a year later.
But Labour insists on providing special aid if people need it badly and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
Suspicious Budget'
Although the ministers did not disclose details of spending after 2011, economists said it was clear that cutting public spending would only be the beginning of medium-term restrictions.
The renowned Institute for Budgetary Studies said the chancellor’s figures suggest substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education and defence in the budget.
"It's really very painful so far," said its director Robert Chote.
“All the important statements will come after the election if we win them,” said Roger Bootle, an economic adviser to Deloitte’s account manager.
"It was a report of a suspicious preliminary budget. The markets are implementing it."
FBI Investigates 'U.S. Prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is conducting an investigation at a prison in Pakistan into five Americans suspected of links to extremists.
The men were arrested for attacking a house in Sargoda in eastern Punjab province, the U.S. embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether the men were the same men who were reported missing last month at their home in the US state of Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said it was also seeking information about the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani origin, one of them has Egyptian ancestors and the others come from Yemen.
“If they were U.S. citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and the circumstances under which they were detained,” Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency had been informed of the arrest and had been in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether or not they are indeed missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
It said the house had always been a focus of the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, but said the United States must "work much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in uncovering the infrastructure of terrorism that is rampant in recruiting and training people."
The disappearance of the five students from their home in northern Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Rejection of amnesty for Iranian bullies.
The human rights situation in Iran is as bad as it has been in the last 20 years, according to an Amnesty International report.
The report details the “methods of torture” in the regime before and after the disputed presidential election in June.
One of the men said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said he was at risk of rape.
Iran has denied the above criticism of the human rights report.
Officials described the criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people have been jailed and dozens killed since the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the biggest street demolitions since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Dozens of them have been jailed and prosecutors have sentenced the last five people to death.
The BBC’s Tehran correspondent John Leyne, who is now based in London, said that in protests earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khomeini had declared some forms of torture unjustified and banned them from the Karizak detention facility.
But since then, almost no criticism of the rule of law has been tolerated, as our correspondent pointed out.
"False Confessions"
Amnesty International cited a report by Ibrahim Methari, a 26-year-old computer science student, who said he was accused of “working with Facebook” and protesting against the election results.
"I've often been punched in the face," he said in his statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliate me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was detained after the protests and was tortured to death in prison and the rest were raped.
Senior Iranian government officials denied the rape allegations, but admitted that torture had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he was held in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and judiciary had set up committees to investigate post-election unrest and the government’s response, but said the mandate and powers of the bodies were unclear and the findings of the parliamentary committees were not published.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow were used to turn the Bristol landmark into a ski run for the race.
The downhill course for the park race attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prizes.
At the top of the ski run in Brandon Hill Park was a short ski jump in front of a 100 m long ski run.
Fourth-year medical student John Hickman said it was a beautiful view from the top of the ski slope, but that it was really depressing.
It was a beautiful view of the flashing lights of the city below.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country – some of them real talent.”
The prizes were awarded for the best pieces - or manoeuvres on the ski track.
After Thursday night's race, the snow was allowed to melt.
Still they and we
Can a Muslim be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters were calling for a ban on the construction of minarets and alarming reports of the alleged Islamization of Europe were spreading in general, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote and informed and pondered whether Muslims could integrate – and integrate – into one of the continent’s most open secular societies.
After reading this book, some readers have become admirers of the author's latest work, "Why the French Don't Like Head Scarves" (2006), this elegant and discussed study of the controversial issues that have divided and occupied the country for 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book has a broader and much more ambitious scope.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened in the ground.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which now cater to 5 <0xC3><0xB7> 6 million French Muslims, what Mr Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students about the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim enter a marriage in a mosque or in a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the development and rights of gays?
Can a Muslim woman marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does a Muslim have the right to use a self-interested banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane controversial issues that are being debated and that are part of everyday life rather than the political dramas that the media employ.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among others well-known persons, including Tariq Ramadan, an Arab, a Muslim researcher and an academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open a discussion about how one can be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They have no arguments for all their customs.
Conservatives are distrustful of the real idea of French or European Islam.
Philosophers and activists interviewed by Mr. Bowen are inclined to believe that this is the opposite of Selafi—the purists of Sunni Islam in Saudi Arabia—this group is small, but it influences European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
He wonders how far the French politicians (and the intellectual elite who so stubbornly defend the lay public) are really committed to the idea of pluralism.
It is believed that Muslims probably have less experience in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than the development of pragmatism, he found "tightening of the screws of values."
Can a Muslim be a Frenchman? After reading this book, someone may have a tendency to say "Yes, but not now."
The most bleak prospects in the world
The Arctic is changing more rapidly than the rest of the planet’s environment.
Bordering ice melts at an alarming rate, affecting animals and their survival like nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural water resources, along with diplomats, lawyers and writers, as they awaken.
In On Thin Ice, Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, recounts the natural history of the polar bear icon of the North.
Well acquainted with the complicated history and practices of whaling, he describes the long tradition of polar explorers trying to capture the polar bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a brave 14-year-old lifeguard who fought only with a musket flask is indeed a myth, but everything else is true.
The young bears that swam behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were captured and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, there were 75 polar bears in one circus tent.
Even today, zoo enclosures are typically a million times smaller than the area available to adults in the wild. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis draws on the works of other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Although hunting is banned in Norway, America, and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada, where they are hunted from helicopters and Indians on skis and are all armed with powerful assault rifles to blast off their prey.
Ironically, it takes place in the water north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book, “On Ice,” Alun Anderson, former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and disheartening account of science’s responsibility for the Arctic and an eye-opening glimpse into how the future can change it.
Scientists don’t have all the answers.
Even meteorologists and oceanographers do not have an adequate response to the rate of change.
It's for lack of exams.
Fridtjof Nansen’s explorations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries first indicated the movement of floating ice.
Cold War submarines then mapped the shifting divides as they sailed past them.
Satellite surveying and extensive fields of probes in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but much is still happening thanks to fearless individuals camping in the winter.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extremely fragile world of the sedimentary system inside the Arctic ice, created by the flow of salt water, which shrinks as it freezes.
But from the bear above to the microscopic miracles inside, all of this is doomed to extinction as soon as the summer ice shifts, which will happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months, it could be us.
6,000 Marines laid wreaths at Arlington graves.
Petty Officer De'Angelo Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the journey from Johnson Camp in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, it was a day to pay tribute to the men and women who once wore the same shoes.
“In a few months, when we get on board, it could be us,” Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me, so that he will show me respect, just as I am trying to do.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered that Saturday morning to lay wreaths at the Veterans Cemetery in several departments at a memorial act in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Funeral Home in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves during a memorial act in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition that Mr. nMorill and his wife, Karen, make this trip every year and stop in various cities along the way to honor the memory of members of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters are not looking for profit, wreaths across America, which they are laying in other countries.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths at Arlington Cemetery, at the Pentagon, at graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at Battery Park in New York City, and at United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial Site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation has been donating more than $150,000 to the purchase and transportation of wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased member of the armed forces.
Because her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt stated that it was her way of reclaiming what makes a victim.
It’s a small way for citizens to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in warm cloth robes, the volunteers walked through the cemetery along the surrounding lawns and hills.
Volunteers headed to older graves from World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War because these are not visited as often as newer graves.
The mood was positive as the children played and held hands together as they transported the young pine tree to the grayish tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red bee arch at the top.
In Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, there was a real silence.
The associated service organizations devoted 1000 wreaths to decorate the department, but the gloomy mood of the ongoing wars filled this area.
Some cried sincerely, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in the cool air.
Some read out loud the names carved into the stones, while others leaned down to look at the little black-and-white name tags pushed into the wet mud where the tombstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped the tears from her son’s eyes.
She was driving eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the final resting place of gunnery sergeant David Shane Spicer, who had fallen in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free . . . my son paid for it, she said.
"Even though I've been gone a long time, I want to be the one to remember him."
U.S. government contractor jailed by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has jailed a U.S. government contractor who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, foreign ministry officials said on Saturday.
The supplier, who has not yet been identified, worked for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company is working on projects for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the U.S. Section of Interest in Havana, sought access to the detainee, who was detained on December 5.
Certain charges have not been made public, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner can be imprisoned for almost anything that is labeled “dangerous.”
All the so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical posts, create the risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and harassed by government agents.
Ms Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country in order to take over the prices, but has been denied permission.
The detention of a U.S. contractor may be the result of growing tensions between Castro’s communist brother, who rules Cuba, and the Obama administration, which has been seen as a “deterrence tactic” in improving relations with the island.
They were the first to report the arrest of the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy stressed that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, the United States will take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought after commodities in a country where the average salary of a government employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones this year; these are mostly used to send text messages, because a 15-minute phone call would cost more than one daily wage.
Internet usage on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and on some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans, who often want to apply, have to announce their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
Detaining an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the handful of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, Gloria Berben, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said.
Mrs Berben said she could not provide more information about the prison.
The arrests and detentions were clearly immoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open society - let's say free mobile phones - are a crime in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U.S. human rights group's program, which recently published an unfavourable report on freedoms in Cuba, entitled "New Castro, the same as Fidel Castro," as an allusion to the installation of Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l.
Vivanco said the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said all solutions would be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries are moving towards more extensive dialogue.
Pakistani government officials are uncovering a plot to send men to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday revealed the alleged leader of a plot to send five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops there, saying they hoped the case could help uncover a vast network of terrorist recruiters who are scouring the internet and searching for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were looking for a grey rebel figure known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after they were first discovered when one of the men posted a comment endorsing the terrorist attacks on YouTube.
Saifillah took over the leadership of these men as soon as they arrived in Pakistan, trying to help them reach a remote area of Pakistan in the zone of the indigenous tribes of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who reported on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convict al-Qaeda commanders and that the men were not part of the CIA’s attempt to infiltrate the terror network.
As a result, they were planted for several days in the eastern district of Sarghoda, far from the menacing mountains in the northwest, which became a haven for terrorists.
They were considered a strike force.
The reason for their removal was said by the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not intimidated and were still trying to get permission to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested under Pakistani law.
The case of the five - who remained in Pakistan and were interrogated by the FBI - highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, identifying who is credible.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence has prioritized attempts to deploy human resources to al-Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization function as guards, eliminating those who are not serious enough in their commitment to holy war and those who might be spies.
U.S. fake recruits have been subjected to special scrutiny by al-Qaeda, analysts said.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential approach to American goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become significantly more cautious in recent years about allowing the koh to approach them because U.S. intelligence agencies have recruited experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to infiltrate these groups, is there no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has already been followed so much? said Mr Kohlmann.
This model is one that is far more web-based.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen to demand climate action
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets this Saturday demanding more climate action from negotiators at the city’s Bella Convention Center.
Protesters have reported the number of many hundreds of thousands attending the event, but police hope the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively quiet, and a handful of masked activists laid several small charges near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day of a minor incident in UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched through the city carrying banners reading "This is not planet B" (i.e. secondary) and one in Spanish proclaiming "The Earth says 'enough'."
The protest was attended by several celebrities, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said she had travelled to her mother’s birthplace in Peru and provided me with information about the bleak state of the country, which is affected by the climate change that is still occurring.
That is part of the reason why we have chosen to join this great march -- to go around the world and appeal to the leading personalities of the world to put forward a just, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done, it cannot be avoided.
Police prevented protesters from approaching the Bella Center, saying they had detained 19 people, primarily because they either had masks on or had pocket knives on them.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one uninvolved spectator, who does not wish to be identified because he is involved in climate talks, activists disguised as athletes and wearing black suits laid several charges near the Copenhagen main canal, which is located near several ministries.
They were agitating at the buildings, he said, starting with flares, but then there were “several big explosions.”
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest is unlikely to have penetrated the minds of key officials, such as Su Wei, China’s top climate negotiator.
When asked if the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of" (really something I don't realize).
Then he continued in Chinese and said, "Because the scene is vast, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He watched to see if the march was painful or helpful, depending on everyone's outlook.
We can see the concentration of the general public and different sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words: "It can also be said that it is a violation of the actions or freedom of other persons.
Test Data Reveals Persistent Racial Differences
Last week’s Federal Certificate of Achievement in Mathematics was a welcome element of good news regarding public education in the District of Columbia.
Although the district lags far behind the country’s high-performance systems, the certification showed greater progress among fourth- and eighth-graders over the past two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago, and New York City.
But what remains hidden behind the latest figures from the National Attestation Center for Teaching Progress are the persistent differences in knowledge gained between African-Americans and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score of white fourth-graders in Columbia County over the past two years has risen from 267 to 270 points (out of a possible 500), but for their African-American peers, it has only risen by three points, from 209 to 212.
Indeed, the gap in knowledge achieved increased from 53 to 57 points between 2007 and 2009.
Progress among African-Americans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a statistically insignificant one point deviation from 245 to 245.
The mean score in white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture in the horizon of six years is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first NAEP in the district was conducted, was 60 points on a scale (262 to 202).
Although the achievement in children from both groups improved during this period, the difference hardly approached 58.
Some district education advocates have said in the past week that the results celebrated by Secretary Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) were more broadly stimulated in white students where results were already high.
That would suggest that we have increased the amount of support for those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and worrying, said Jeff Smith, CEO of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for equality of education in the district.
“I’m not jumping up and down for two or three points,” said D.C. committee member Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of elementary school in Eaton.
Often criticizing Ms. Rhee's management style, Ms. Brown said that reporting on test results meant secondary education in the city was in a desperate state and required attention.
Obviously, you always want to see the good, and I respect that.
But what’s terrifying is that we didn’t devote nearly any of the time and energy that was needed to our high school education.
Ms. Rhee said the district's effort is to continue to look for better ways to address the needs of students with low scores.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of the new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at upper-middle-school and high-school students who have failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their post-secondary careers by significantly lagging behind their peers.
The day-to-day math and sixth-grade math curriculum, highlighting the games and real-life experiences that made it into the district under former director Clifford Janey, can be attributed to the progress of NAEP, which was reported last week.
And I just think we should continue to work and do the best we can with those students who stay below the classroom level, said Mrs Rhee.
Others said the NAEP results clarified the question of whether Ms. Rhee could continue to improve the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for schools with low performance, which is necessary to narrow the gap.
It’s a definite dilemma for Mrs. Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studies test results in urban areas.
The conventional remedy procedure is to focus resources and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of the District of Columbia.
Thus, the focus can bring political reverberations that go against an important agenda.
But the reproach also belongs to other city directors who are trying to maintain a middle ground between white and black.
We need to focus on building a system of big schools.
We need to strengthen the kinship of our schools so that all families, no matter where they live, can be confident that their children will be provided with excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, now the head of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that a fundamental element in reducing the gap between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, to realize the legitimacy of the schools.
You need to get up to 200 days to push through the changes, said Mr Janey, who signed a contract with his teachers’ association last year for a 185-day school year, which he sees as a “symptom” for seeking a bigger increase next year.
Making higher education a part of a better future
The tour bus entered Gettysburg College with loud breathing.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stepped out and rested for a moment on white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Graciela's parents barely graduated from college in El Salvador.
So far, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, has never entered the college grounds.
Now she and the other eighth-graders in the group were exploring Gettysburg, where tuition was $38,690 a year, their standing was rather than fearful visitors enthusiastic prospective students.
Yes! That's it! cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide invited them to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? she said thoughtfully when they told them the professors' low student-to-student ratio.
Pennsylvania College was one of seven they visited on their three-day trip, and now they were completely taken by the future news: The question is not whether you will enter the college.
The question is where.
However, this is a major problem regarding the high number of Spanish-born children in the US who are expelled from universities or become pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who receive a college education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, a fifth of this “long generation” of Spanish college students — remarkable results achieved — report that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central American residents, made it to the United States without completing college.
Their success story is important, the researchers say, because it underscores their point of progress for a generation that has played a marginal role in the country’s workforce.
Those who have achieved higher education say that they had a natural inclination towards school and an innate penetration and desire to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and looked for ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciel and the millions of children who would like to go to college — especially if these efforts persist over time.
If we take into account that children come from low-income groups whose parents do not have the experience and ability to help them navigate the system, any simple intervention at every single point will not solve this, says Patricia Gandara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American region.
We have to think about providing these kids with a pre-school net in every way they can to get through college.
The federal program that funded Graciela's track trip is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to launch dorm preparatory programs that start for students from low-income high school groups and continue until those students graduate from college.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, more than 1% of whom have entered dorms, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraq's Oil Ministry Reaches Deal With 10 Foreign Oil Companies
Despite fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government succeeded in getting major oil companies to rebuild their infirm infrastructure during two auctions on Saturday.
Ten deals have been struck by Iraq’s oil ministry with foreign oil companies, suggesting that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are poised to play a major role in rebuilding Iraq’s oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies have left with equity holdings in just two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one made a lost offer.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements on the field, which was auctioned in June.
The modest participation of American oil giants in the open Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, you have Asians and Europeans on the road in the first place, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, online news.
It'll be a long time before anything else is for sale in Iraq.
Security concerns, highlighted by Tuesday’s massive coordinated bombings and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the U.S. military, are likely discouraging U.S. companies from doing much more business in Iraq, which has arguably the third-largest raw material reserves, analysts say.
U.S. firms have been at a disadvantage in some cases, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy firms, which have significantly lower operating costs and are more vulnerable to risk because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to enter into agreements with the ministry.
Leading U.S. firms such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained close ties with Iraq’s oil ministry and offered technical assistance in recent years, have walked away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts that were awarded at the end of this week.
The state-owned National Petroleum Corp. has participated in more contracts than all other companies and has left with large stakes in contracts in two major fields.
“We all know that China is striving to become a major economic as well as technological power,” oil ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be comparable to the competition and will meet its obligations towards Iraq.
Companies that were pre-selected to submit bids, which were then compared by the ministry according to the price per barrel, and the ministry is willing to pay to strengthen output above the current level in each field.
Al-Qaeda's top planner appears to have been killed in Pakistan.
A U.S. missile strike near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border this week apparently killed a top al-Qaeda operations planner, U.S. counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
As confirmed, this could be the second deadly attack on one of the supreme leaders of the terrorists.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs killed when several rockets hit their car near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province on Thursday, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities said the missiles were fired from an unmanned aircraft of the type operated by the CIA in a zone of illegal indigenous tribes.
They were pointed at a white car heading for the Afghan border when it was hit, the official said, along with Pakistan's civilian intelligence agency, which was calling from Miran Shah.
The official said local gunmen rushed to the point and quickly seized what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials quoted an unspecified witness as saying Somalia was poi death.
Somalia has been cited as a high-ranking planner of al-Qaeda military operations who directed operations of terrorist groups outside the areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in founding around the world, said a senior official who did not wish to be named, who cited the sensitive nature of U.S. air strikes on Pakistani territory.
If he held such a central position, he was probably involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from al-Qaeda's top leadership, and based on them, he planned possible terrorist attacks.
Another U.S. official said Somalia quickly advanced in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well-connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not have been a well-known figure for some Americans, but he didn’t humiliate himself in any way to pose in front of us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second high-ranking leader of al-Qaeda or the Taliban to be killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the indigenous tribal zone and three other top-level operational leaders.
The rate of attacks launched by the CIA using drones has dropped since the summer from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to Long War, a website run by the nonprofit group.
The downgrade may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also ruthlessly killing people they suspected of being informants, the website said.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Kabul has resigned.
The United Nations’ top delegate to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would step down from his post in March, ending a tumultuous term that has been marred by allegations of widespread corruption in the U.N.-backed election.
Eide’s departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
A U.N. delegate said he supported the increase but expressed concern that the U.S. timetable for the reduction, which begins in 18 months, should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO nations to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the construction of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they should have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment made must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian staff assisting in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning but was simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he would only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to file a U.N. report.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has now said he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it is high time to look for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has launched a search for compensation.
Officials said he was deciding between Staffan di Mistura, who is of Swedish-Italian descent and previously led a UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenn, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide’s position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, was indicted in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the country’s presidential election by masking the presence of massive election machinations.
Eide denied these claims, but said the Galgraith indictment -- which was released -- "certainly damaged the mission because there was a high degree of skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he was proposing a meeting with the top U.S. citizen representative to coordinate relief efforts with U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to lend them to the Afghan mission, so he said he wanted to strengthen their confidence that their money was being used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at limiting his efforts in Afghanistan, saying the UN’s cumbersome hiring regulations undermined its ability to use capabilities.
The UN rules are such that I have had the opportunity to get only one person since May, he said.
It's a disaster, and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces more sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers would soon impose "other significant sanctions" on Iran over its lack of engagement in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to a soldier’s question about the likely development.
One of the things that depends on me is whether I have learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, [it] is inherent unpredictability in war.
The Obama administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could hit Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has signaled that some of these sanctions could also hit ordinary Iranians.
He said an “incentive and disincentive package” would require “to make the Iranian government really feel less safe with nuclear weapons” because “its residents will suffer extremely” sanctions.
According to a statement issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs on Friday, the administration has engaged European leaders in warning that Iran will face serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the UN nuclear security committee and its oversight body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop its expertise for peaceful purposes only.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks on curbing his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial portion of his stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed fuel for the reactor to conduct medical research.
The administration has advocated such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two sides and to buy time for negotiations.
But since then, it seems, Iran is withdrawing from the interim accords — partly because, the expert says, the Iraqi leadership is divided on whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, as far as Iran's stubbornness towards the international community is concerned in the case of some of the proposals that he actually agreed with at the beginning of October, I think this has led the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together on a path that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to proposals before returning to seeking other elections, including surveillance, which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “degrading sanctions.”
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations on Thursday condemned what it called "unsubstantiated and unsubstantiated allegations" made to some members of the Security Committee about Iran's nuclear activities, saying it wanted to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "for the sake of achieving an adequate long-term solution."
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki this morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdistan region to meet soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, especially over borders, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to avoid delaying U.S. plans to limit the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
U.S. officials quoted Gates as telling Massoud Barzaani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government, "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In an ageing China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters reading that "Mother Earth is too exhausted to support more children" and "One more child means one more grave".
Then they were taught that when official government offices in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and aging population in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples, their reaction was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always devoted all our time and energy to one child.
We didn’t save anything for others, says Wang, 31, a human resources manager who has an 8-month-old son.
China’s more than 30-year-old policy of having only one child has been implemented, creating two generations of notoriously chubby and pampered children, affectionately nicknamed “little emperors,” the country is threatened by a population crisis.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple compared to six before the policy took effect, according to the UN.
The distribution of the population, where the population aged 60 years and above is projected to grow violently from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This is well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is greater in wealthy coastal cities with populations with university degrees, such as in Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over made up nearly 22 percent of Shanghai’s registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission for Population and Family Planning, said many couples need to have children to “help reduce the proportion of an aging population and reduce the size of the workforce in the future.”
He says it's about "being old, it doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden."
Gradual calming
As enshrined in the country’s 1978 constitution, China’s one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate introduced under Communist Party rule to date.
The two who broke the policy faced huge fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
Chinese officials have been pushing policies that have helped the country prevent critical drawdowns of natural resources, while human rights defenders have been condemned in policy enforcement.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women with their second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples had to undergo sexist elective abortions, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, population officials have been progressively milder in their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they generally allowed for exceptions - including urban dwellers, members of national minorities, and cases where men and women were singles - and in 2007 eased the dictation of their hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Beijing University Institute of Population Research, said central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, posters urging parents to have only one child were replaced by copies of the ordinance detailing how it would be legal to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet with couples in their homes and slip flyers under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial counseling for those who chose to have more than one child.
The response was cold, family planning officials said.
The Sorrowful Response
Although officials in a rural city near Shanghai saw an increase in interest in couples who would like to have a second child after the start of the campaign, most of the city districts did not report changes.
Huinan City District with a population of 115,000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only around 165,000 – slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai’s Caolu district, said financial considerations were probably the main reason people didn’t want to have more children.
They want to give the best to their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Yuanyuan, 26, said she would like to have two children and was legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have inadequate health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a docial interception network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge the one-child policy as a legal issue, says Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is in the seventh month of pregnancy with her first child.
Yes, we were deprived of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
It's about money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, the human resources manager, says they only want one child because she was also an only child: “We were the focus of our families and everyone looked after us.
We were not used to providing care and in fact we did not want to take care of others.
Chen Zijian, the 42-year-old who runs a translation company, has expressed this much more bluntly.
For middle-class, two-career parents who have reduced birth rates, he said, being successful means being selfish.
Today’s 20- and 30-year-olds view parents as the first days of China’s experiment with capitalism unfolding, and they don’t want this way of living for themselves, he says.
One child is making enormous demands on parents’ time, he says.
A mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the controversial questions of the propstor -- "You must rebuild your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You must have a resume ready by the time the child is 9 months old for a good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, Che says, but not two.
We are the first generation with higher nutritional standards, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The UN Group has outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reaching undisciplined attitudes and mutual slander -- focused again on Friday on releasing a document that proposes ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years with industrialized nations bearing most of the brunt in the near term.
The text, which can provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as illuminating the way forward.
But important progress was seen in the negotiations that took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Created by the UN ad hoc working group, this text unobtrusively states how much money rich countries should provide to the poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a range of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies to limit their carbon output and what the upper limit of global temperature rise should be that policymakers will still be able to tolerate.
This adds a lot of flexibility to the process, says John Coequyt, the head of the Washington-based Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, a 180-page summary of the meeting’s text to focus on what top UN climate official Yvo de Boer described as a “big picture”.
It outlines the outlines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations could collectively reduce their emissions by a year to 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions during this period to 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union agreed on Friday to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to climate change, from managing floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
Still, Friday cited the same kind of verbal fireworks that prevailed in talks last week.
U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern has rejected a speech calling for binding greenhouse gas emissions reductions for industrialised countries compared to voluntary contributions from major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world.
The shift signaled that the Obama administration had set a tougher line on China than Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States will not accept the treaty without the transfer of major developing countries and the implementation of actions, said Stern, who also complained that the text is not sufficient to secure restrictions and should be vetted by external observers.
Stern made the comment an hour after China’s deputy foreign minister, He Yafei, told the U.S. chief negotiator on climate issues that either a lack of “rural sense” or “extraordinary irresponsibility” led earlier in the week to the message that the United States would not help China financially to deal with global issues.
With the future economic trajectory of the world’s major powers at stake, confusion has erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current struggle is mostly about preserving individual economies rather than preserving the planet, between China and the United States over the fulfillment of their respective commitments, while poorer nations point out that two dozen of the world’s most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take stronger action.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it was not surprising that major powers were fighting over who should bear the cost of curbing greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries became much more aggressive in finding ways to prevent large issuers from taking responsible action.
It’s clearly a game that a new economic hegemony is unfolding, said Ulate, who also serves as regional adviser on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international nature conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change have indicated they would like to continue pushing for a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants said a political agreement would be the best outcome of the talks.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States created a 24-page draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate talks for the European Commission, said the push by small island nations "has caused political push for the whole political process" partly because they are now united and demanding action from growing economies such as China and India.
The negotiations prompted a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining contentious issues before the heads of government could compete for an agreement.
High-ranking officials such as India’s Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China’s deputy minister stepped out of the aircraft and ran through the halls of the Bella Center to closed-door meetings and new conferences so they could set out claims to be assessed next week.
The sheer scale of the gathering - with 13,000 people moving daily from and to the convention center, guitar-playing activists staged ironic shows at night about the countries they thought had sent them, and hand-to-hand proposals were handed out on paper rather than by e-mail -- controlled by a challenge.
The intensity is only a superstructure: almost all key ministers were present in Copenhagen, and earlier 60 heads of state were present on Wednesday.
We have reached high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, the deputy minister for global policy at the International Nature Conservation.
Heavy weights are coming.
Britain’s first 140-mile-per-hour train redefined feelings this Monday
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, the whistle cut through the darkness to mark the departure of the train, which marked a revolution in transport in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed passenger train will reach speeds of 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford in Kent to London’s St Pancras, covering a distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmes and embarked on the first high-speed passenger train outside London.
It hopes the new service will eventually connect Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains, and connect the large agglomerations of Midland, the north and Scotland with London.
Neglected standing water should shorten travel times in passenger transport and on commercial routes, and a shift from aircraft and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate congestion on the roads.
Theoretically, the three main political parties were recruited for this vision.
But the tens of trillions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inescapable battle over projects, and environmental concerns have now put a brake on Britain’s high-speed rail.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a feasible study, handed over its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times reported.
She provided him with a detailed map of the routes of the next planned stage of the high-speed network.
A new route linking London to the West Midlands has been proposed for up to five metres in urban areas and neighbourhoods where access to the environment could be problematic.
In the open landscape, a final route of up to 25 m was planned.
HS2 also envisages to determine three options for an extensive high-speed network leading to the north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped configuration, where one high-speed line should lead to the West Midlands.
The line is to be divided near Birmingham with one branch running from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other leading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
"It looks like the most efficient choice has been made," he said, and a rail expert.
Once this is done, the travel times between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not open before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to more than one hour in the present.
The proposals would allow trains to run at 2,250 miles per hour, making the UK network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is already being designed to carry 400 m of trains that would be able to carry 1,100 people.
Up to 18 trains could operate every hour on the London-Birmingham line.
This means that the London terminal would be able to handle up to 20,000 passengers per hour if needed.
Given the capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing station would expand to accommodate a high-speed network.
Rail experts say that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be made before the general election.
Even if it sets the wheels in motion, the grid should be built in parts.
Trains should first be put into service not on high-speed lines but on existing lines north of Birmingham, keeping the time between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is considered to be a crucial point of contact for ensuring the transition from aircraft to trains, a landmark for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers pay <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 mortgage on Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, the Tory leader in the House of Commons, was paid thousands of pounds by taxpayers last year for an orangery he built in his constituency home.
The party’s prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living “out of rations,” raised his mortgage to <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak-lined extension in his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge special interest, hundreds of pounds a month in total, to taxpayers.
The municipal authorities approved the claims in time, and so he was not questioned by Sir Thomasen Legge, who carried out the control of the members' expenses. Last night, Mr Duncan made his demands "it could have been cleaner or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, owns two two-storey country houses in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
The houses are worth about a million pounds.
There's a kitchen, a living room and a dining room on the ground floor, but the IRS agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a winter garden to the house, which is designated as an "orange house" in the plans.
Neighbors describe it as "a glasshouse for fun and entertainment."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last inspection by the Committee on Municipal Standards and Privileges in the last mortgage settlement.
The committee told him last month that he had broken the rules after reviewing his spending.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed his <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 mortgage on his London property to a house in his constituency, which he had bought in 1991, a year before he became a member of the House of Commons.
Documents released this week showed that Mr Duncan was claiming around <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 a month in interest on the mortgage until March last year.
In April, his claims rose to more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 a month.
The interest on Mr Duncan’s RBS mortgage payments could not change at this time, suggesting that all this was intended to finance a <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan.
The standard RBS variable mortgage payment declined in December 2007 from 7.94 percent to 4 percent in March this year, while remaining.
The latest municipal document shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 a month this May.
Mr Duncan left his job as House shadow leader in September after a secretive lawmaker filmed him and said MPs must survive an “allotment” after the spending scandal.
"Basically it's nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated like s**t."
He said, "I spent money on my garden and my claim and a small fraction on what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I'm not going to do it."
The MP, a millionaire from a former career as an oil trader, was first asked to explain his issues in May when it turned out he was claiming thousands of pounds for his garden, even before the tax office’s approval that it “could be considered excessive”.
One activist dug a pound-shaped hole in Mr Duncan’s lawn in protest after it was revealed he had been claiming <0xC2><0xA3>4,000 for three years.
When asked last night about the mortgage increase, Mr Duncan said: “It was because of the capital increase, which was approved by both the tax office and subsequently by Legge.”
He added: “This is not a contentious issue of hiding and looping or breaking rules or anything else.
It's an absolutely straight line down, by the rules, justified, and that's it.
It would not be cleaner or simpler in many other ways.”
Come and take a closer look at the cottage on the Brighton coast with the advent calendar.
The coastal cottages in Brighton have found a new meaning of life in the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that invigorates cottage enjoyment with creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their cottages for each day in December, and to use Christmas carols as the theme of this decoration.
The event began on December 1, when it allowed visitors to view the last hut from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and bishop's bread and boiled wine, provided free of charge.
Selected carols included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First No<0xC3><0xAB>l, where the hut featured the work of Janet Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a television marketing assistant from Brighton, is a priest without a scholarship in the Diocese of Chichester and head of Beyoncé.
He said: “We want to make religion much more important for people in post-Christian society.
"Why should we, as a church, expect people to come to someone else's old building? I feel that the church should come to the people and serve in an awakening way.
"The idea of the advent calendar in the cottages was created just as an interview with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we tried to try and present it in a spiritual way.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday to demand a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming to be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, where hundreds of people were arrested by police around the world.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000 organizers, demonstrated in the cold weather of the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN climate conference, which aims to adopt an agreement by Friday, which could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, said that the growing global mobilization, which is clearly evidenced by the current manifestations, contributed to the fact that the "political tax" of a possible failure in Copenhagen would be too high.
According to an AFP journalist, there were incidents in the Danish capital shortly after the start of the parade, when a group of about 300 demonstrators dressed in black began smashing the windows with paving stones and hammers.
The riot police immediately intervened.
In total, police announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people and specified that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical independent groups that had already manifested themselves in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "without distinction" and stressed that about a hundred of them were in handcuffs and sitting "held in the streets on Saturday evening" despite the extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the procession quietly headed towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
Demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get inside.
A podium was built for the speakers, in front of which a spiritual candlelight meeting was held with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters came by bus and train from major European cities, and in addition to Africans, there were also a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue raincoats, formed the first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the invitation of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create "blue waves" for a "fair climate".
Today we are taking to the streets to demand a settlement of the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
“We can no longer say, ‘This is the time,’” said Angelique Kidjo, a singer from Benin.
In Africa, rivers and waterways are drying up, today we can walk in them, and this has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement to fight for another world approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, one of the figures fighting for another world, said he had arrived in Copenhagen with the aim of "connecting climate and social justice". "At present, there is no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world."
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
About 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia, according to organisers.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, marched in red clothes and with scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, and Canada, several hundred protesters took to the streets demanding strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in the "350" protests, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Dozens of people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia Elects Its President, Georgia Condemns It as ‘False’
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognised the pro-Russian separatist territory as independent from Georgia, while Tbilisi declared the move a "fake."
About 131,000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17h GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhazian Electoral Commission, the turnout was 58% a few hours before the polls closed.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including incumbent President Sergei Bagapsh, categorically reject the idea of merging with Georgia, which has condemned these elections.
This election is a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has completely fallen into Russian domination," his spokesman, Manana Manygaladze, said.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognised the independence of the 216,000-strong territory, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which has been illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After the separation from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia is trying to show through elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, a new era of our independent state, Kvartsia Sv<0xC4><0x9B>tlanová, a 54-year-old historian, told AFP.
She was one of those who came to vote in the voting room of the school in the capital Sukhumi, in a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is the main topic of the presidential elections in this region on the Black Sea coast, which can boast of beautiful nature.
Across this small country of 216,000 people, huge billboards are placed with Bagapsh alongside Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials who came to oversee the successful conduct of the elections were warmly received by the district mayor Beslan Arshba.
“We, the Abkhazians, are grateful,” he said in a small ceremony, referring to Moscow’s support and, in particular, its decision to recognize Abkhazia’s independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, and drank a glass of vodka on it.
The opposition, represented in the election by former vice-president Raul Khadzhimba and two businessmen Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised contracts signed last year with Moscow, such as a contract that allows Russia to control Abkhazia's rail network for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he supports neither the current government nor the opposition.
An absolute majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive battle must take place within two weeks.
Climate: world events, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday to demand a strong and binding agreement to fight global warming to be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, where police arrested around 700 people worldwide.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000 organizers, demonstrated in the afternoon in cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, negotiating an agreement that could come into force on January 1, 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the procession quietly headed towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
Demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get inside.
A podium was built for the speakers, in front of which a spiritual candlelight meeting was held with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
According to an AFP journalist, the incidents occurred shortly after the parade left, when a group of several hundred demonstrators, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began breaking windows.
The riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened without waiting, knocking several protesters to the ground.
In total, police announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people and specified that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical independent groups that had already manifested themselves in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer on his jaw was injured by a cobblestone and four cars were set on fire near a squat near the incidents, which resulted in the arrest of about 20 people, according to police sources.
We are focusing on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, as police helicopters took off again.
Most of the protesters who arrived by bus or train from major German cities, London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But there were also a lot of Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue raincoats, formed the first meeting in the morning in Copenhagen at the request of the group Friends of the Earth, which wanted to create "blue waves" for a "fair climate".
Today we are taking to the streets to demand a settlement of the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, one of the figures fighting for another world, said he had arrived in Copenhagen with the aim of "connecting climate and social justice". "At present, there is no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world."
Oxfam has summoned several celebrities, such as Danish model Helen Christensen or former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
About 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia, according to organisers.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students dressed in red and wearing scarves evoking the importance of solar energy, demonstrated in front of the city hall of the capital of the Philippines.
Several hundred demonstrators also met in Hong Kong and Jakarta to demand strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in the "350" protests, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Dozens of people gathered in Geneva.
The subjects of geography and history will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general grammar school, Chatel said.
Education Minister Luc Chatel said in an interview with JDD magazine on Sunday that subjects in history and geography would be "strengthened" as part of the reform of general grammar schools, even though their teaching will no longer be compulsory in the final year of grammar school with a focus on exact sciences.
Now all second-year students will have four hours a week and the same general culture program will be available for everyone, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, "it is necessary to put an end to hypocrisy" because, according to him, specialization S is no longer focused on the exact sciences "but "basically the best students are in it".
With some sub-specialties, he continues and emphasizes: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would complain that geography and history are not taught in the last year of professional grammar schools".
A poll by the Ifop agency, which published the Humanité daily on Saturday, showed that seven out of ten French people (69%) disagreed with the government’s project to abolish compulsory history and geography classes in the S-class, which is why many intellectuals and teachers criticized the abolition.
On the contrary, the Minister added that "it is not possible" to cancel the philosophy in the program of specialization S of the graduation year.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform in teacher education, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for participation in Tuesday's mobilization against this project, which they say is sacrificing the pedagogical education of future high school professors.
As part of the Master's Degree 2 (M2) they will take an entrance exam at the beginning of the year focused on their field and at the end of the year another exam verifying their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will take part in professional internships during the second year of the master’s degree and in the first year they will act as a professor-intern before the students.
If you add up all the internships that will be offered to you before the admissions process, you will gain more student experience, almost 300 hours, he continued.
The minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education", which does not yet exist in national education.
The project to abolish the school map by 2012 has been reconfirmed.
At the elite <0xC3><0x89>cole Normale Supérieure, experts have 15 minutes to convince the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the goals of the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge announced on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (GIEC) at the initiative of Ecole Normale Supérieure University on Ulm Street.
As one journalist told AFP, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a one-day seminar consisting of 15 minutes of expert contributions that will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and make them want to learn more, 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, explained on the occasion of the conference, which was named after the fish from the local pond, which was named by the students.
About twenty contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines will be selected, and he specified that the selection is based on their charisma.
“We can talk about climate warming for hours, but we can also sum up the basic goals in a few minutes,” Jean Jouzel, who spoke to 50 people without making any pre-arranged remarks, told AFP, using only graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed, with the hope that listeners will learn that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a very seriously prepared scientific basis".
The videos of these lectures will be posted on the school’s website from 15 December.
The next seminar "Ernest" is scheduled for February and others will follow with regularity every two months.
Delays in payments: angry prison guards, planned measures
Unions of prison guards announced "general mobilization" on Friday as they demanded that they be paid bonuses and overtime, the payment of which was postponed to January for financial reasons.
Prison FOs (the 2nd Guards Union) asked staff who were not on duty to take part in a demonstration in front of the prison facilities on Tuesday morning to "block them" and draw attention to "theft of their wages".
The CGT for prison wardens (3rd sector trade unions) called on them to "convene assemblies in individual prisons and start a fundamental mobilization" on the grounds that it is "shameful and unacceptable" that "overtime and surcharges for night work, on Sundays and holidays" not be paid in October.
The First Union of Wardens, the Federal Union of Prison Wardens (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for an overall mobilization ... in order to express dissatisfaction and indignation".
The administrative directorates and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtimes increased a lot in 2009 and were not all included in the financial budget, but they assure that the amounts due will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Mario had sent a message to the prison wardens’ unions assuring them that payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts made by prison staff to ensure the functioning and modernization of our prison system, the Minister writes in her message.
I have ordered the Directorate of Prisons to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation created by the miscalculation of the number of overtime hours is never repeated in the future, added Minister Alliot-Mario.
Therefore, the December salary will be low, with the exception of managers who receive famous bonuses for performing functions and achieving goals, according to Ufap/Unsa, and for those "there is always a place in the budget".
It is simply a scandal, the interregional FO Union in Marseille has become indignant and announced its decision to boycott until the recall of "all meetings and subpoenas".
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or holidays unless their allowances for these days of October are paid in December, as well as overtime, the FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne is also at risk.
At a time when we are being given more and more work and more responsibilities without having to put additional staff at our disposal, it is sad to allow the lowest-ranking employees to pay for it, according to the CGT prison guards in Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better than others.
However, in any case the funds because of little, stated the Secretary General of Ufap, Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
Obama Says He Gives 'Better Gifts' Than His Christmas Gifts
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family at the White House, confided to the "goddess" of Oprah Winfrey's screen that when it comes to gifts, he has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than the ones I get."
The president and his wife Michelle spoke in a special broadcast on Sunday night on ABC about how they plan to spend the Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, gets his share.
“Jesus loves Bo, too,” Michelle Obama said, adding that the dog would also “obviously” receive a gift, as evidenced by excerpts from the show’s pre-airing.
And Michelle Obama also objected to her husband’s claim about the quality of the gifts he receives: “Well, no, I gave you a nice gift last year,” she teased the president.
Well, that's true, the president was forced to agree, but immediately afterwards, with humor, he pointed his finger at the first lady's pearl necklace: "And who gave you this?"
In this one-hour, very relaxed show with the famous presenter, who worked hard to support Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, Obama’s husbands also talked about their favorite gifts they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a bike with a ten-speed gearbox, but also a basketball, which was given to him at Christmas by his Kenyan father, with whom he met only very rarely.
“I remember seeing my father come to see us for Christmas and he gave me that basketball,” he said.
It wasn’t until a long time later that I realized that he had actually given me the ball.
The first lady remembered the dollhouse.
I didn’t know how to organize everything in the house, so I lined up all the furniture along the wall instead of placing it around the fireplace, but I loved that little dollhouse, Michelle Obama recalled.
Johnny Hallyday Re-Operated, RTL Reportedly in Artificial Sleep
Johnny Hallyday was operated on again in Los Angeles for "injury" following a larger operation he underwent in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his immediate family, while RTL station reported that the singer is in artificial sleep to prevent pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was operated on again from Wednesday to Thursday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors noted an "injury resulting from the operation" of a dislocated disc he underwent in Paris on November 26, his press department said in Paris, adding that the lesions required "operations".
However, the singer’s press department tried to reassure the public that the situation was “under control” and announced that a new medical communiqué would be issued no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, the lead partner of the singer's latest tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into artificial sleep to avoid "pain and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we will be a little more confident, RTL adds.
The press department, when asked by AFP, did not confirm or comment on this information.
RTL also states that, according to “some sources”, no drains were located in Paris after the first operation.
Rocker was operated on at the international clinic Parc Monceau because of a protruding disc.
The surgery, which had already been scheduled several days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajaux, a doctor well known in art circles.
The doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on the RTL information.
Following the surgery, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection that occurred after the surgery.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday's, told RTL radio on Thursday that his friend was going through a "bad period" but added that he was "not worried about the rocker" because he was a big "fighter".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing something stupid, because it's no fun to spend 12 hours on a plane after such an operation, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, producer Jean-Claude Camus said Johnny Hallyday was “responsive to antibiotics” and that the infection had been “stopped.”
Mr. Camus also said that he had met Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
The singer’s health problems have only been multiplying since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone’s surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday had been operated on for a “small tumor of the small intestine” and then for a minor infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his farewell.
But since then, his every health problem is very much watched and commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team again had to deny the report of a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: Bousquet's premiere in his favorite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the 2009 World Championships in the Big Pool, won the title at the 2009 European Championships in the small pool in Istanbul on Thursday in a discipline he particularly likes: the 50m freestyle.
On the first day of the championship, where overalls were last allowed, only three world records were set, although many more were expected.
One of them surpassed the Hungarian racer Evelyn Verrasztová in the 200 m position race and the two remaining men's relay of Russia in the 4x50 m position race.
A great sorrow for Bousquet, who set a world record in the 50 m freestyle, which he already holds in a large pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal swimming events, the 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, which saw ten swimmers take off for the first time instead of the usual eight.
Bousquet defeated Croat Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30) as he had anticipated.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore overalls made of polyurethane, which will be banned from January 1.
The overalls have helped set 238 world records since February 2008 and their era ends in Istanbul, which was the first to host the same competition in 1999.
Even the Germans, Paul Biedermann, a two-time world champion in a large swimming pool in Rome in the summer, who had a world record at his fingertips, did not benefit from the use of the overalls this time.
The young swimmer failed to break the record he holds for the 400-meter freestyle (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn’t put everything into the race.
I knew I wouldn’t break the world record this time, but I defended my title and did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future, Biedermann explained.
U.S.: Zola's Romanesque sarcophagus sold for $1.5 million
A record by a Romanesque sarcophagus that belonged to none other than French writer Emile Zola was auctioned on Thursday for $1.5 million, significantly more than estimated, art dealer Sotheby’s said.
The price of this two-meter-long and 63 cm-high front plate, dating from the third century AD, was estimated at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
Marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in elaborate architectural decor, surrounded by satires and bacchants is a rare work, there are very few such pieces in the world, perhaps four or five," Florent Heintz, vice-president of the Ancient Roman and Egyptian Art Auction, told AFP on Tuesday.
The work was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still ongoing, but it is the item that has been the most tendered, Sotheby’s spokesman Dan Abernathy told AFP.
Emile Zola's purchase of this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The plate was in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous Borgia family collection, and then gradually appeared with the French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated a bath with it in her private hotel in Paris, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third Republic in France and briefly the President of the Council before the accession to power of Marshal Petain.
It remained there for about fifty years.
Florent Heintz discovered during a search of the Louvre's database that the plaque was part of "the remains of Emile Zola" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Therese Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
An aborted attempt to withdraw President Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico.
Mexico ruled on Thursday that the conditions for the transfer of ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya, to whom the rebels refused to provide a guarantee of a safe departure, were not met.
After the telephone conversation I had with President Zelaya last night, everything so far suggests that there is no way to carry out this transfer, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
A Mexican government plane that flew to El Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya flew back again, a source from the Directorate-General for Migration said.
The putschist government wanted to force President Zelaya to resign and apply for political asylum abroad, only to give him the opportunity to leave safely.
But the deposed president rejected these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as the head of state in exile.
The putschist government "had another setback when it wanted me to resign ... they wanted me to resign," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, in which it often spoke about the political crisis that has been raging in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, added the deposed president, who has been hidden at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a few chords.
The Mexican Embassy has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transportation, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, the interior minister of the Puchi government, Oscar Raul Matute, told Honduras' HRN radio on Wednesday.
“I will not seek asylum in any country,” Zelaya said in an interview with Caracas-based Telesur.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as president of the Honduran people.
Rumors of Zelaya’s departure mobilized supporters of the ousted president on Wednesday, who had come to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military has stepped up protection.
Brazil's foreign minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the putschist government's stance.
This shows their marginal attitude to international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who had grown close to Venezuela’s socialist president Hugo Chavez, was toppled on June 28, the day he organized a public consultation in preparation for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
He returned unexpectedly from exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and found refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he gets out of there, he will be arrested and held accountable for the crime of “high treason” for which he is accused, according to the putschist government.
President Roberto Micheletti held a presidential election on November 29 to replace President Zelaya.
In controversial elections, recognized by the United States but condemned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street Rises, U.S. Trade Balance Boosts Optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended Thursday with an uptick, with the U.S. trade balance showing an uptick in both the U.S. and its partners: Dow Jones gained 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to final closing data, the Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points and the Nasdaq, with technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, commented Lindsey Piegz of FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focused on "half full glass".
For Avalon Partners’ Peter Cardillo, investors are focusing primarily on U.S. trade balance numbers, “which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6% in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, expected the deficit to rise.
There has been an increase in both imports and exports.
The big news is the growing volume of trade, especially exports of goods, which is a reflection of the growth of the economies of the main trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
However, unemployment rose against all expectations in the United States last week and the number of job seekers reached 474,000.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job applicants has dropped “to its lowest this year,” said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The stock market also fell.
Treasury yields with a 10-year view rose to 3.482 percent from 3.423 percent on Tuesday night, and 30-year yields rose to 4.492 percent from 4.408 percent the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of regime supporters booed "Ladies in White"
Several hundred Cuban regime supporters booed the wives of political prisoners who gathered in Havana on World Human Rights Day on Thursday and prevented another demonstration in which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
Forty "Ladies in White", wives or close political prisoners were booed on the street by Raul Castro's regime supporters as they marched towards the capital's centre demanding the release of political prisoners, the journalist said.
Away with the Yankees!, "Mercenaries!", "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" chanted the regime's dissenters with a raised fist.
The dissidents were eventually escorted by civilian personnel who arrived to "ensure security".
A day earlier, a similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" had taken place in Havana, but there had been no injuries or arrests.
But in Havana’s Vedado district, about 10 dissidents were detained by police in civilian clothes who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday on World Human Rights Day, an AFP journalist reported.
According to the journalist, the police loaded dissidents who had been sprayed by government supporters into civilian vehicles with the use of force.
Arresting dissidents in similar conditions takes only a few hours.
Winners of the Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament for 2005, "Ladies in White" organized an unauthorized march for "the release of all, according to dissent, about 200 political prisoners," said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda is serving 20 years in prison.
Mr. Maceda is one of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be "mercenaries" or "agents" paid by their arch-enemy, the United States.
A finished miracle, Cuban television brought the news of Thursday's manifestation of the government regime's supporters against the "opponents of the revolution".
Cuba, led by the Communist Party and a one-party government policy, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of failing to respect human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A madman killed an 80-year-old man with a knife and injured five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A madman armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five others in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at peak times on Thursday afternoon.
According to preliminary results of the investigation, the attacker at the age of 28 allegedly attacked with two knives and, for unknown reasons, an 80-year-old man in a pharmacy or before it, on 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of the police and witnesses.
The badly injured old gentleman, born in 1929 according to the Alliance Police Syndicate, died in hospital as a result of his injuries.
In this pharmacy or in front of her, the attacker then attacked the pregnant woman and her partner.
Her husband, aged about 30, began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where an 80-year-old man died.
The life of the other injured is in danger, according to police sources, vital organs were apparently affected.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to hospital "in shock," a police source said.
An armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled to the street, still on the boulevard Jean Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s.
He injured two other people, apparently by accident: a 30-year-old man and a 40-year-old man, the other seriously.
How it all came about is not entirely clear, as it all took place in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher's knives, which he carried crosswise behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, head of the Alliance Syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passers-by, including young people, tried to stop and disarm the madman, according to testimony gathered by AFP.
I saw a 30-year-old guy in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar, commented on the situation.
He was thrown by a crowd, including a city policeman, who broke his wrist, he added.
Still on 61 Jean-Jaures Boulevard, two city police officers, including their commander, attempted to detain an armed man and were injured by fists, a police source said.
The incident occurred in one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
The passers-by came to tell me there was an injured person outside.
“I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and I noticed a big wound on his stomach,” Frederic Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person in his 30s came along, who also had stab wounds with a knife.
The man, who had no ID, was later arrested by state police.
The public prosecutor in Nanterre referred the case to the investigation department of the regional police in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The suspect was taken to hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody, awaiting questioning.
A police source did not rule out his placement in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said it took six police officers to handle him at the police station in Clichy, where he was taken.
He was "completely beside himself" as "all the lunatics of this type, whose power increases tenfold in action."
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer calls for end to prosecution
The lawyer of the Polish-French director Roman Polanski asked again on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to stop criminal prosecution against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence because of a moral affair that took place thirty years ago.
Chad Hummel, the legal counsel for the director of "The Pianist," criticized before three judges of the second district appeals court in California the serious errors that occurred during the trial at the time of the events in 1977.
I demand a halt to the prosecution now and immediately, lawyer Hummel said, adding that from the behavior of the judge who ruled on the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband "had a chill in his back".
According to him, the judge (who had already died in the meantime) was supposed to deal with the prosecutor before the verdict, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison – which is a serious offense against the rule of law.
Information about this interview appeared in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" (Roman Polanski, Wanted and Desired), from the mouth of the prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells eventually claimed at the end of September that he had “lied” to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, lawyer Hummel will demand a trial in which he will be able to present evidence of his claim.
The applicant reiterated what had already been said in the first State case, namely that there would be no serious examination of the request to stop the prosecution until Roman Polanski appeared in court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, before a court ruled in a case of "illegal sexual intercourse" with a 13-year-old girl.
He never entered the United States again.
Los Angeles District Attorney Phyllis Asayam said Roman Polanski "should be there to attend the trial."
In this case, do we want to tell not only Roman Polaski, but also other defendants that it is possible to escape? asks Mrs Asayam.
He said the director "seeks favor in court and despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to make a decision, also stressed "that there are other alternatives to escape".
Lawyer Hummel was not alone in asking for a halt to Roman Polanski’s prosecution.
The victim's attorney, Samantha Geimer, has also called for an end to the prosecution.
She recalled that her client could no longer bear the eternal harassment every time the Polanski case surfaced, adding: “No one in this room can say that the trial was fair.”
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland at the behest of the United States.
After more than two months behind bars, he was released under house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, where he is awaiting possible deportation.
Wall Street Ends Without a Direction, Struggling With a Rising Dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended Friday with no direction, the market fluctuating between indicators that are better than expected in the US and the rising price of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained +0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to final closing data, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points and the Nasdaq, with technological dominance, left 0.55 points and ended at 2.190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Frankly, the market is very calm, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow range, the volume of trade has decreased very much and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
This trend has also been confirmed by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators that "helped to improve market sentiment in terms of economic recovery stability," analyst Charles Schwab summed up.
U.S. retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and far more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate by the University of Michigan’s Consumer Confidence Index, U.S. consumer confidence also returned, rising sharply in December to 73.4 from 67.4 the previous month.
However, the indices were held back by a new rise in the dollar’s price against the euro, which is the highest in the last two months, pushing down sectors sensitive to the economic situation, said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technology is losing ground under its feet.
The stock market has fallen.
Treasury yields with a 10-year view rose to 3.540% from 3.482 percent on Wednesday evening and with a 30-year view rose to 4.497 percent from 4.492 percent a day earlier.
The choice of Miss World again in South Africa.
After a month-long journey across South Africa, 112 Miss World contestants are set to cross the finish line on Saturday to achieve their dream of being voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion TV viewers.
This great celebration of beauty has been held in the vicinity of Johannesburg for the second year already and so far five candidates have been promoted to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariata Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbrataru and Yanbing Ma from Canada were selected during their African stay Miss sport or Miss top model.
It was a real vortex of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I’ve seen a lot of things and I have so many experiences!, said Miss Sierra Leone.
The contest, which will be held in South Africa for the ninth time, will be broadcast live from Midrand, in the north of Johannesburg, from 5 p.m.
I couldn't have dreamed of a more beautiful country where I could wear a crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I am happy to have been able to experience it twice, said Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova, in the hot southern summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in South Africa was in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and a new discovery of the country and its “breathtaking landscape”.
After a month of performances, rehearsals, press encounters and safari, Miss is now focusing on the competition itself.
India's Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who also participates in the election of Aishwarya Rai, the 1994 winner who both became Bollywood stars.
Being crowned the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman’s dream, but it’s not just about looks.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to come home with a crown, says Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th year will be held in the spirit of music and dance.
Candidates will perform in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The performance will be presented by Chinese TV presenter Angela Chow, former beauty queen of South Africa Michelle McLean and the chairman of the Miss World committee Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with warmth that is difficult to cope with, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World pageant.
Like last year, the candidates participated in a safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hand.
"Unusual for a president," said Miss Sierra Leone.
Undoubtedly, the most beautiful memory will remain the draw in Cape Town (in the south-west of the country) for the World Cup, which will be held in June 2010, and which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could meet people I never dreamed of.
“I will definitely be returning to the 2010 World Cup,” said Miss Italy Alice Taticchi.
According to David’s son, reports of Hallyday’s condition are “very positive.”
The news of Johnny Hallyday’s condition is “very positive,” as his son David assured us on his arrival at Los Angeles Airport on Friday, where he flew to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It is very strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday said as he stepped out of the plane he was flying in from Paris shortly after 1 p.m.
The singer’s calm son said he would arrive “as soon as possible” at the Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday due to a post-operative infection following an operation on a dislocated intervertebral disc he underwent in Paris on November 26.
According to a press release, the singer was in Los Angeles for the sake of comfort "inserted into artificial sleep" to prevent pain and facilitate the administration of treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was already put to artificial sleep by doctors at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles. He was hospitalized due to an infection following an operation on the dislocated intervertebral disc on November 26th in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be operated on again on the night of Wednesday to Thursday.
According to an AFP photographer, his wife Laeticia attended a school performance of a French lyceum in Los Angeles on Friday morning, attended by their daughter Jade.
The head of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology at La Pitié-Salp<0xC3><0xAA>tri<0xC3><0xA8>re Hospital, Yves Catone, announced that he was leaving for Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer strongly accused Dr. Stephan Delajaux, a neurosurgeon who operated on the singer at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris on November 26.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, said M. Camus.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday “went too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of his Paris surgeon.”
I personally spoke with the doctor by phone and he assured me that this trip was not a problem, which surprised me greatly, since I myself had already suffered twice from the protrusion of the intervertebral disc, he added.
A moment earlier, RTL radio reported that the singer apparently flew away after the Paris operation without a drain, without anything.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in art circles.
He operated on the actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, which he was working on at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg in the removal of a hematoma resulting from a brain hemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, convicted several times in cases of neglect of medical care, for tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Medical Chamber, described him as “a man without scruples” who is “regularly” summoned to the Medical Chamber and who cannot even be “recommended from afar.”
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke through his lawyer, David Koubbi, on Friday.
He said the procedure had been "completely good" and that post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation was not of a hemorrhagic nature, therefore the introduction of a drain was not necessary,” he added.
The singer’s health problems have been increasing since this summer, and in any case, his next tour seems to remain with the question mark.
“Obviously, the date for the resumption of the planned tour on January 8 seems too close,” Camus said.
The UDF raises the tone and calls on the Nouveau Centre party not to use their abbreviation any longer.
The UDF, controlled by the MoDemFran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bayrou party, responded on Friday to an attempt by the president of the Nouveau Centre party, Hervé Morin, to appropriate the abbreviation of the former Giscard party, saying it could not be used in any media under threat of prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to appropriate the abbreviation UDF, saying that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayra does not deserve to carry her legacy after he shook hands with the left.
The defense minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Movement Nouveau Centre (NC).
His move won the support of Hervé de Charetta (former MP for the UMP now behind the NC), who attributes ownership of the UDF brand to himself because he first had it registered with the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la proprieté industrielle) in 2004.
But on Friday evening, a committee of the UDF, led by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou’s friends, who have no intention of being expropriated, stepped out of its silence and made a formal request to the minister and MPs to stop using the abbreviation and hand back ownership of the trademark, under the threat of criminal prosecution.
In recent days, you have raised the alarm that you will propose to your political movement to take back the abbreviation UDF, writes the Association in its letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the committee, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from the MoDem party or Senator Jean Arthuis from the Alliance Centre.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your movement the name + Nouveau centre +, with the slogan +UDF today +, the signatories of the letter also note.
As you know, you have no right to use this abbreviation, explains the UDF committee, which asks the NC movement to "immediately remove all mentions of the UDF name from all promotional materials, including (their) website".
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the ownership of the trademark to the legitimate owners".
If you do not, we will appeal to the courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends "choosed" to leave in 2007, "to create a competitive movement, as others did in 2002 to establish the UMP.
Thus, according to them, the Nouveau Centre movement has no right to use the abbreviation UDF (Union pour la démocratie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join the MoD for three years and to create a committee charged with defending the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the committee continues, "when he registered the trade mark", he was "not a member of the UDF for three years already", but of the UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent way, he used a non-existent registration acronym to do so at his own expense.
This tactlessness begins to turn into a crime, they declare, and then ironically express themselves to the NC strategy: "It seems to us that both in politics and in everyday life it is more valuable to make a name for ourselves than to get out of anonymity by fraudulently accepting a name to which we have no right."
Liliane Bettencourt's case: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of a state of weakness.
The court in Nanterre decided on Friday to try the artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier and to rule on whether he used the 80-year-old billionaire’s state of weakness to deprive her of part of her fortune, which her daughter Liliane Bettencourt blames on him.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his celebrity photographs, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for malpractice, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years and a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>375,000.
This decision confirms that there will indeed be a trial in a case that can be described as the family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which a mother and daughter attack each other and fight for the management of the cosmetic empire of L'Oréal.
However, the 15th criminal court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which should be carried out by a college of three doctors.
The heiress and principal shareholder of L’Oréal has always refused to undergo such an investigation, certainly not under the conditions offered by the public prosecutor’s office in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should draft a report by 10 March 2010 and also state whether Liliana Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness and in what period.
I think he's going to undergo it.
I will talk to her about the matter, said Mrs Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, after the hearing.
As regards the lawyer Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, he welcomed the court's decision.
This is excellent news(...). Expertise will show that this old lady, who needs protection, was manipulated (M. Banier), confirmed.
It’s been two years since Liliana Bettencourt’s only daughter opened criminal proceedings against Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-around artist whom she blames for taking advantage of her mother’s state of weakness for years to receive a gift of a billion euros in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or master paintings.
Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be manipulated by a photographer she considers a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the legitimacy of the lawsuit filed by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, Friday's lawyer's court speech changed into a family hour of truth.
Liliana Bettencourt’s lawyer presented three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she expressed her distrust of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bettencourt-Meyers’ husband.
In a 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt said: “You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.
Since she got married, I have never been able to talk to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise.”
The Public Prosecutor’s Office in Nanterre again found that the applicant’s conduct was not justified, all the more so as the guardian judge in these days rejected her request to initiate proceedings to grant legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully capable of participating in the trial, is not under protection or guardianship.
No one else will act for her,” said Marie-Christine Daubigney, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor’s office.
The court finally decided that Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would be entitled to comment at the time of the opening of the proceedings.
The management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence was useless...
For more than a decade, the behavior of the management of large companies towards employees has been reminiscent of the approach of companies to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about co-workers identifying themselves with the "values" determined from the mountain, as it was before, when it was necessary to impose on the consumer products that came from the ideas of the heads of factory technicians.
By making the customer the center of business companies, the marketing revolution has leveled the strategy of conquering the market in the right direction... even though authoritarian efforts to force products other than customer preferences regularly return!
The passive attitude of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon, which mainly affects managerial cadres.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "requires from all stakeholders (...) an active approach and the ability to anticipate" and demands from employees commitments that are completely at odds with the revenues of authoritarian management.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that aims to put workers at the centre of business as well as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion polls.
Will internal opinion polls – like a questionnaire submitted to Orange employees – contribute to a revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I have already convinced myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure after various turns will return preferably to what it has always done!
Furthermore, because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases in proportion to the severity of its own failures.
And finally, because most managers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are university graduates for engineers, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For reasons of convenience, they adopt the old behavioral theory, now revived by "neurosciences" from the USA and widely disseminated without much knowledge by scientific institutes and the media.
A recent Ipsos survey on Figaro.fr showed that it is possible to move the "levers" (sic) of managers' involvement, which only establishes managers in their position of mechanical control, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of the final vision of human behavior.
Incorporating a basic insight into all management intentions and practices: For employees, commitments to the business will only be possible if they appear to be a clear means to achieve their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At present, this concept of employee motivation is only dealt with by the study Motivational functional analysis.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of a predetermined doxy, which will allow them, through the image that tells about the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobilisation factors, managers can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resource management "on the right track".
This creates a breeding ground for the development of solid and effective economic intelligence.
In a speech from Oslo, Obama won praise from the right.
On Friday, the American right welcomed a speech delivered by Barack Obama the day before in Oslo, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner had defended the concept of a “just war” against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives, who initially mocked Obama’s October 9 award, applauded the presidential speech this time, including Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin, the muse of the right-wing Republican wing, told USA Today, adding that she herself had expressed "sometimes necessary" wars on the subject in her memoirs, which are now coming out.
War is, of course, the last thing Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
All terrorists should be detained there, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from his predecessor, George W. Bush, justified the deployment of forces in Oslo on Thursday and used the speech to explain his decision to send another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done a "very good job" in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really very good, congratulated the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who appreciated above all the President's mention of "the existence of evil in the world".
In a way, I considered this speech to be completely historical, Gingrich said during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former MP, considered by some to be a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, was thrilled to see a "leftist president" remind members of the Nobel Committee "that they themselves would not be free and could not hand over the peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, former speechwriter George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama delivered a “very American speech.”
Not only did he introduce himself as a “world citizen” as always, but he “spoke like an American president” and reminded Europeans “that they live in a safe bubble that they themselves have not created, and that they are not doing too much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the few dissenters on the right is the Bush-era hawk, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, who described the speech as “uniform, pompous and uninspired,” according to the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich, for example, is horrified to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
"If we wrap the war in a blanket of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the middle-left press takes a positive view of the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times still considers awarding the peace prize to Obama to be premature, it has hailed his performance as a “superpower,” even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech should serve as a guide to international decisions in conflict resolution, in the fight against poverty and oppression.”
Obama "made the speech that was needed," the New York Times said, calling the speech "simple and instructive."
Road Carriers: Three marathons to a deal that will save the supply of supplies for Christmas.
After three negotiation marathons, the road transport unions and the TLF, the only employers’ organization that remained until the end, came to an agreement on Friday evening that ended the call for a strike and the threat that hung over Christmas supplies.
Transport Secretary Dominique Bussereau expressed "joy" at Friday's signing of the agreement after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of discussions, the negotiators broke up early on Friday morning with the hope that the text of the agreement would be signed as soon as possible at the end of the morning.
And this despite the fact that three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew from the negotiations.
But it took another more than six hours of the meeting, which began at 11 a.m., to get everyone to agree and at 6 p.m. to sign the agreement.
This conflict "would cause great harm to businesses" and "would threaten to disrupt the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text contains wage increases of 4% for the lowest salaries (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (international transport).
The hourly wage at the lowest wages increases from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
It’s not much, but there’s a lot of effort behind it, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight, we're going to give our members an order that there be no blockades, no blockades of the supply centers.
But there may be a few more opponents who are not satisfied, "he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed the “right deal”, even though it was hard to admit the rise in high salaries given the international competition.
According to him, there will be an increase of 170 euros per month for the lowest wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest ones.
It is an agreement of common sense and respect for employees, CMaxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for a 3% revaluation of travel expenses and a report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow for a focus on the issue of the 13th salary and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled the "reduction of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million in corporate payroll taxes" that was the subject of the government's amendment to the 2009 budget bill voted on Thursday night by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate for a "consistent" vote.
The signature allows this agreement to apply first to enterprises that are members of this organization, later to the entire field, in the case of expansion by the Ministry of Labor.
It will take place "as soon as possible", Bussereau assured.
The whole process can only be hampered by the opposition of employers’ organisations.
FNTR refers to "bad trade" as <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million "has already been offered to the sector as part of the carbon tax offset".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to act in an emergency, not as a result of mutual analysis, but in order not to anger the turkey eaters at the time of the approaching Christmas holidays, Unostra complained.
For Otre, the agreement threatens to "bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry" in the next 12 months.
Suburban RER A trains: traffic disruptions at the weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP’s proposals.
The disruption to the RER A suburban line, which is the largest public transport line in France, will continue over the weekend, as Friday's talks between the unions and the RATP leadership on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results on the issue of the premium claim.
On Saturday and Sunday, the days of the important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will run only between 10 and 20 o’clock, on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) every other train will run, outside this section only one train out of four.
The connection to SNCF will be cut off at Nanterre Préfecture and passengers will be forced to switch to another train.
Galeries Lafayette department stores, which are expecting over 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP was trying to secure a connection with large department stores."
The RER A line runs from the west to the east of the Paris agglomeration.
The section administered by RATP runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one train out of two was in operation at the peak, and virtually no train set was running at the off-peak time as planned.
As on Thursday, the inhabitants of Ile de France arranged differently and there was no confusion on the platforms.
So early in the morning there were far fewer people in Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) than usual, among other things, because there were no pupils and students.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 years old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he got up “an hour and a half early to make sure he arrived on time.”
The Saint-Lazare station was not crowded, the SNCF state railway announced, as a larger number of officials and law enforcement officers were predicted.
Suburban RER A trains operated by SNCF in the direction from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left from Saint-Lazare station with a connection to the metro.
The next general meetings of the strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, where the results of Friday’s afternoon meeting with the leadership will be evaluated, which the unions assessed as “weak”.
The RER management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER A suburban trains in all respects, the adjustment of working hours, the course of career, etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who demand a well-deserved premium, according to Thierry Garon (OdboryJih).
RATP even postponed the premium proposals for the time being, making the CGT worse, saying that the management "was not able to solve the problem while it was possible for the travel carriers and SNCF".
The new meeting, which is scheduled for Monday, "will closely review the conditions of employment," RATP said.
This was the reason why the trade unionists thought that the company was “making fun of weekend travelers”.
In the morning, about 150 drivers occupied the company committee at its Paris headquarters.
The leadership, which until now had rejected any discussion during the strike, therefore decided to hold a meeting in the interest of "calm down".
There is a danger that the conflict will spread to the RER B line on Tuesday, after Unsa and Independents announce a strike standby.
The unions are asking for a premium ranging from 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Indépendants (Independents)) and are complaining about the deteriorating working conditions on this line, which carries a million passengers a day.
RER commuter train drivers earn between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,200 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,700 in gross wages and between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>600 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>650 in bonuses for irregular working hours and for Sunday and public holidays.
The Turkish judiciary has dissolved for the Kurdish side, and this decision has serious consequences.
Turkey's Constitutional Court ruled on Friday to abolish the country's main pro-Kurdish party, prompting protests in the Kurdish community in the southeast and in Istanbul.
The decision could complicate the task of the government, which is trying to lend a friendly hand to the Kurdish community and try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become "a nest of activities threatening the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Supreme Court President Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of talks.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, who needed a majority of seven votes to dissolve the party, Kili<0xC3><0xA7> said, adding that 37 party cadres, including its president Ahmet T<0xC3><0xBC>rk and MP Aysela Tuglukova, were banned from participating in political life for five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. T<0xC3><0xBC>rk and Mrs. Tugluková and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 500).
The party leadership warned before the verdict that MPs would rather leave Parliament than act as MPs without political affiliation.
The decision follows a trial launched in 2007 by prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses the DTP of obeying the “orders” of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is a legal political showcase for the PKK rebels.
The party says it has no "fundamental links" with the PKK but refuses to identify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s verdict comes as the government lends a friendly hand to the Kurdish community, offering a range of measures to strengthen their rights and trying to limit Kurdish support for the PKK to end the conflict.
The DTP leadership confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to a resumption of tension in southeast Anatolia, where in recent weeks many demonstrations against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan is detained have turned into clashes with police.
Since the announcement of the justice decision, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast predominantly populated by Kurds.
Police used tear grenades and water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails or fired slingshots.
About 100 people demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr T<0xC3><0xBC>rk said the justice decision would only "deepen despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue by banning the party, he said in a press release.
The government, consisting of a party descended from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We're out of principle against party interference.
This is not a problem, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a complete blast of the democratic proposals launched by the government, political scientist Ahmet Insel commented.
Of course, we can look forward to a response from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for one of the deadliest attacks in northern Turkey, which killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
Snow can come.
A very crispy winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, says the head of the FES winter technical services department.
But so that its employees can try and learn to control all the car technology.
This could be the first time this has happened, according to meteorologists.
Over 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In doing so, the FES follows a precise plan.
As soon as it snows all over Frankfurt and the temperatures drop below zero, they will go to 20 so-called sections A of the big dump, explains Brauburger.
These sections include the main and passageways such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
But also arrivals for firefighters, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and descent sections like the Atzelbergstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
The FES service starts at 3 a.m.
If necessary, it is necessary to sprinkle with moist salt, which holds better, for a maximum of three hours, about 1040 kilometers.
Therefore, the FES begins at three o'clock in the morning, "so that the roads are free when the transport to employment begins."
It doesn’t snow until 7:30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter technical services department, "because no one is willing to make room for the spreaders."
Only when it is not snowing so much, there are access roads and connecting roads, among which is also Rat-Beil-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
The last priority is given to the side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they'll complain there.
At five o'clock in the morning, FES pedestrians set out on the road, preferably cleaning dangerous places and crossings.
FES usually cannot take care of all bike paths.
In Frankfurt, there is a special service that monitors mainly bridges from 22 to 4.30, Brauburger says.
Because they quickly form a glacier, the sprinklers leave as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
The police will also call them if necessary.
Cradle of Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: The animal, two meters long and 1.50 meters high, ran on two strong hind limbs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short forelimbs with sickle claws and a long tail.
If this species lived a few million years later, there would be nothing extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in the Thursday edition of the journal Science write that Tawa hallae was, however, one of the first dinosaurs with these body features.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in the equatorial dry region of the supercontinent Pangaea.
Tawa opens a new window on the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about kinship relationships, expansion, and the signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavations at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes we found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for triassic sediments, according to team member Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavations, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
The finding confirms theories about the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the solar god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an unusual finding: "Fossils of dinosaurs from the Triassic are very rare, usually only individual fragments can be found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
This finding is not particularly sensational, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the attribution of pradinosaurs is often disputed.
Experts discuss, for example, when lizards were divided into three most important developmental lines: carnivorous theropods, which later included Tyrannosaurus rex, Velociraptor, and also birds, "long-necked" quadruped sauropods and their relatives, and herbivores, for example, Trinithischia, and herbivores.
Tawa hallae is, after analysis by Nesbitt and his colleagues, the original therapod.
It exhibits an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, researchers have found evidence of air sacs, which even the descendants of theropods have birds.
Thanks to the air sacs, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air sacs, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related lineage of giant sauropods later also had air sacs and light bones, this useful innovation has probably already created a common ancestor of both groups.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, scientists have deduced that lizards first appeared there.
According to this, the three lines of development soon separated and spread from South America to all continents, which at that time, as the supercontinent of Pangaea, formed a uniform mass of the earth.
It would also speak for the fact that the team, along with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related, theropods.
The three cannot come from a common, immigrant ancestor, the scientists argue.
We believe there have been at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, the Silesaurus, which belongs to the group of the heaviest dinosaurs, lived in today’s Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His hypothesis could put together a distorted picture, because in South America very many primitive dinosaur fossils have been preserved, while on other continents they are rarely found.
How the dinosaurs proved that they evolved from a relatively rare lineage of reptiles to the ruling vertebrates of the earth during the Earth's Middle Ages remains a puzzle.
During the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying lizards, and countless other lizards.
Around the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread around the world and many new species evolved, while relatives became extinct and the Triassic and Jurassic interfaces.
The success story didn’t last forever.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction that dinosaurs happened to survive, but reptiles didn't.
Or the dinosaurs adapted better, so they could squeeze out the competition.
The history of success did not last forever.
About 150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped another group of animals that also evolved in the Triassic and has lived in the shadows ever since: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Associate professors from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen joined.
The police evacuation of the occupied casino of Frankfurt’s Goethe University has caused a worldwide uproar.
278 professors and teachers at Goethe University, as well as universities across Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" of the presidium's instigated police intervention.
Because the walls and artwork were stained, university president Werner M<0xC3><0xBC>ller-Estler cleared the building, which was occupied last week by striking students and lecturers.
Five students were injured.
Damage to the case, according to the signatories, does not justify "the forcible dissolution of self-organized teaching by students and teachers of the police commando".
The eviction represents an "unacceptable interference" in the freedoms of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to "unauthorize and criminalize the protest" and divert attention from the content.
The Presidium avoided the necessary discussion.
The speakers call for an end to the criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that most of the strikers did not support material damage.
Legitimate protest
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German trade union also stand in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for one’s own future, says the mysterious Earth Youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
The Hessian Minister of Science, Eva K<0xC3><0xBC>hne-H<0xC3><0xB6>rmann (CDU), has so far defended the university president's and the police's approach.
We are grateful to the President of the University.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said on Thursday at the Aktuellen Stunde (Current Hour) in the Wiesbaden Landtag.
“We have an understanding of the protest, but we have no understanding of vandalism,” said Peter Beuth, MP for the CDU.
The opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and Linke saw it differently.
The CDU is using painted walls as an excuse to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (Linke) said.
Instead of addressing the arguments and demands of the students, there was an eviction.
Linke has filed a motion calling on the interior minister to report on the police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, was a strictly guarded location where secret weapons research was carried out.
Today, this district with a population of 216,000, located 37 kilometers from the Moscow center, is considered to be the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centers are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established contacts with the Frankfurt Research Center Riedberg - with university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
Several mutual visits took place and on Wednesday Zelenograd and Ridberg signed the "Protocol on Close Cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Russian delegation was led by the Moscow mayor Yuri Roslyak and the prefect from Zelenograd Anatoly Smirnov, and the chief planning officer Edwin Schwarz signed for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in natural science research will go to a seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
It is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to tap into the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large concern Sitronics and Rossiyskaya Elektronika.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green City") got its name from the forested hilly landscape in which research facilities are planted.
The Stuttgart Brake
The Stuttgart 21 dimension cannot be prepared at all.
For the supporters of the project, it is quite simply a "new heart of Europe".
The S21 is more than just a train station, it's more than a monstrous structure that will plunge the capital of Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg into a desperate building chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
The main stations with railways, which ended in the city center, were then considered to be transport-technical fossils of the 19th century, which act as brakes on modern rail transport, because it took an enormous amount of time to reverse the locomotives from the rear to the front.
Pull over, stop for a moment, move on - that's how it should work.
That is why the main stations are disappearing: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies about half the route of the Trans-European Railway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
It really starts with the S21, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Very ambitious designers themselves realized that in the Hesse and Bavarian cities, the start of construction is almost unfunded.
Since there are modern pendulum trains with motor and control vehicles at both ends, the main stations no longer have problems with detours and detours.
Still: It starts with Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE line to Ulm.
Local and local politicians have done it.
The railways cooperate, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state concern.
The project can still be excused in some way.
A new urban space will be created, which - if we believe the computer images of the designers - will contain a lot of greenery.
For the railway transport system, S21 is harmful.
The railway station and the construction of the track are intended for passenger transport, which - typically in the 80s - was attributed to a huge increase.
At that time, there was no competition for cheap flights.
However, modern transport policy must focus primarily on strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than road freight transport.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains due to steep climbs.
Even more serious, S21 indirectly affects many other rail projects.
A good six billion euros were to be buried in Swabia.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion is real.
It is clear that in the next decade there will be a lack of funding for other nodes and bottlenecks in the network.
There are 60 major projects on the Ministry of Transport's list.
One of the most important is the construction of about 180 kilometers long route through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, it has been building on this route at a slow pace.
We need to push hard here.
But the S21 will be like a brake.
The Rhine Valley route will become the neck of a bottle of international freight: right in the heart of Europe.
The government is investigating the decision on the airport
The state government has left open in the Wiesbaden state assembly whether it will go against the ruling of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban and have it reviewed.
The CDU/FDP coalition has mandated experts to legally review the more than 400-page VGH ruling, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
VGH in Kassel today argued in writing that the state would have to re-adjust the night flight ban if the planned Northwest runway of Frankfurt Airport were to be built.
Permitting 17 flights between 11 p.m. and 5 p.m., as envisaged by the state government, does not correspond to the protection of the population against night air traffic noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4 if it will demand a revision of the verdict.
The opposition criticised the postponement and urged the government to abandon the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD faction, Torsten Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-G<0xC3><0xBC>mbel, has called on the CDU and the FDP to return to the promises of a ban on night flights made before the election. Otherwise, it can be assessed as a "violation of the word".
It’s damn hard if you can keep your word, Green Tarek Al-Wazir said in an allusion to the FDP’s election slogan, “We keep our word.”
Minister Posch rejected Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-G<0xC3><0xBC>mbel’s reproach, the state government is trying to get to its night flights by “distorting the law and tricks”.
Accurate legal control needs its time.
The coalition does not want to work on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan M<0xC3><0xBC>ller (FDP).
His faction’s statements on the night flight ban have never been the same as those of the opposition.
U.S. banks repay aid
America's crisis-shocked big banks are getting rid of state bonds.
Bank of America repaid a total of $45 billion (around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 billion) in aid from the Tarp bank rescue fund on Wednesday.
According to a CNBC report, Citigroup also plans to repay the state aid.
Thus, the constitutions want to get rid of the restrictions that have been imposed by accepting money - limiting bonus payments to managers and paying high fees.
Bank of America has secured $19 billion in net cash from investors through convertible bonds.
The rest of the amount was taken from its cash register, which was filled, among other things, thanks to trade union sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis on Wednesday night explicitly thanked the U.S. taxpayer: Money injection has helped us through a difficult time.
The money institution damaged itself at the height of the financial crisis by taking over investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup wants to free itself from its obligations to the state also by obtaining money on the capital market.
CNBC, citing sources, reported that the U.S. bank may have announced on Thursday a capital increase of about $ 20 billion.
Citigroup did not want to comment on this.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley repaid the aid.
Quick selection
It went faster than expected, after all.
The station unveiled its successor just two weeks after ZDF’s board of directors ousted editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender from office.
Last night, the greme wanted to make a deal on that person.
The favourite was Peter Frey, head of ZDF’s studio in Berlin.
But the station did not confirm this - officially, so as not to pre-empt the process.
But the role could also be played by the fact that they did not want to damage the ZDF intendant Markus Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter, if this proposal did not pass the board.
Frey, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the Grémie.
The result of the vote was not known prior to the closure of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter's board of directors crashed with his proposal to extend his contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven against him, and Brender's loss of the mandate was a bitter defeat for Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter, though it was to be expected.
The EU majority on the board of directors had signalled weeks before the election that it did not want to confirm Brender in office.
The resistance to the editor-in-chief was organized by the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to remain in the office of the highly respected editor-in-chief, arguing that under Brender the quotas for monitoring ZDF's news broadcasts had fallen.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was sharply criticized.
The last time, 35 state-law lawyers intervened in the debate, which considers Koch’s actions unconstitutional.
It wasn't for nothing.
About person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romanism.
Then he worked for S<0xC3><0xBC>dwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey joined the ZDF, first in the heute-journal.
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 head of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then head of the main studio of the ZDF.
After Brender, who was voted Journalist of the Year on Wednesday, was deposed, the Greens announced they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch’s rival on the board, the Rhineland-Palatinate prime minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the federal states should change the state treaty with the ZDF so that the intendant’s personnel proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
Beck, however, also refused to exclude party politicians from the ZDF supervisory boards.
Brender's supposed successor, Peter Frey, ordered the board of directors to make a clever chess move - immediately after Brender's ouster, he strongly criticized the award.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he could nominate him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face as Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter, so he could be elected by the board of directors without suspecting that the party had been pushed into office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is no different from the left-liberals.
Studying to get rid of junk
Partly successful for students: After a year of strikes, culture ministers finally arrived in the federal states on Thursday: At the conference of culture ministers and university rectors, both sides agreed that there is a will to improve the study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the test load: In principle, each study module should be completed with a single test.
In addition, the workload of students should be reviewed and a "realistic and defensible level" should be guaranteed.
Politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of examinations among universities in Germany and abroad.
The L<0xC3><0xA4>nder are committed to creating a more flexible joint structural assignment for Bachelor’s and Master’s degree programmes.
Earthly deviations should cease to exist.
Fewer tests
Since the student protests began in the wormhole, culture ministers and university rectors have had winged words of better study in their mouths.
Now, for the first time, they are filled with concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Board agreed that the number of examinations will be reduced in part drastically: "Each module will normally be completed with only one examination," says the 30-page report, which is to partly regulate the approval of study programmes.
"A significantly lower test load," said the chairman of the accreditation board, Reinhold Grimm, is to be "stopped the erroneous development, which significantly limited the complexity of the study."
To do this, the "demand of study" in the future is to be the "decisive criterion" in the implementation.
Modules and content must be "hard-checked" to "not unnecessarily restrict students when choosing
The seminars.”
Students should have a “claim for space that allows and supports self-initiative”.
The rules are to apply when approving new fields of study, but also for existing fields of study.
These need to be “recast” every five years – which means it will take until 2015 before all fields of study are reviewed.
There are ten accreditation agencies throughout Germany, which are subject to accreditation boards set up by the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder.
In October, the culture ministers called on the federal states to act on the agencies in such a way that the content of the curriculum is not too large and the test regime is not strict.
In the individual L<0xC3><0xA4>nder, universities and colleges have already agreed with the state ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country so far, Rhineland-Palatinate has pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna Process.
Of the money, universities should primarily pay for consulting programs and study advice, and strengthen testing and foreign offices.
Countries and universities want to spend <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million on this.
In early 2010, the government wants to submit an amendment to the Higher Education Act to parliament.
According to her, only one exam should be required to complete the study module.
The formation of studies should be even more flexible, the recognition of examinations from other universities should be guaranteed and the accessibility of the master's degree should be facilitated.
By the end of next year, the complexity of all study fields in the country should be reviewed.
The government and the opposition on Thursday again argued about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the resolution.
The Federal Board of Higher Education Groups, Juso, has called for education policy-making not to take place "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors in the future.
At the latest after the strike, "at least a word should be said" by the students as the persons concerned.
Future academics also received support from the president of the conference of university rectors (HRK), Margreta Wintermantelová: "We need the experience of students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with culture ministers, with whom HRK discussed a joint reform report.
According to the Departments of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolutions did not go far enough: They require a legal claim that would allow any graduate with a bachelor’s degree to access an extension master’s degree.
Second, the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder must ensure that there are enough places available for today’s generation of bachelor students in the best possible study conditions for tomorrow’s master’s degree courses, said GEW board member Andreas Keller.
The federal states must employ far more lecturers.
However, the ministers of culture did not comment on free access to the master’s programs.
More than a footnote to Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller
Getting to Germany and out is nice, almost no control...” is the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner, which in this torn-out language piece focuses on the experience of the arrival of a dissident who gained freedom, but at the same time lost his linguistic environment.
Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, working first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a teacher of a children's book publishing house, then in 1982 he moved to Frankfurt am Main.
S<0xC3><0xB6>llner was awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he lectured on poetry at the legendary Goethe University in Frankfurt, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hessian Literature Forum in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Last Tuesday, a seminar in Munich took care of a significant non-literary stir, at which "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the broken mirror of its security acts" was discussed.
Apparently insecure and infuriated, S<0xC3><0xB6>llner left a statement in which he confessed to cooperating as a secret informant of the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow Romanian German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totek, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present, S<0xC3><0xB6>llner won the German Language Prize in 1989.
Attempts to recruit began inconspicuously, first in 1971.
I am, S<0xC3><0xB6>llner continued, "someone who has not sufficiently resisted attempts at intimidation by the Securitate."
The poet Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner is the secret agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the awarding of the Nobel Prize to Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller and her unparalleled literary handling of the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors originating from Romania, is shaken by a case that marks the depths and infamy of a political system based on control and control.
Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner is not, at least as far as we can tell, only the perpetrator, but he is also the victim.
Secret Agent Walter played a role in the Securitate files, Michael Markel said after S<0xC3><0xB6>llner’s confession, referring to the positive influence of Secret Agent Walter on himself.
“He was punching me out at all the important points for him,” Markel says.
He has a moral obligation to make this remark.
S<0xC3><0xB6>llner’s statement in this form and before this audience was unexpected, but absolutely surprising confession of the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service.
Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller wrote back in July, when she read her own files, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the Securitate spies.
They will speculate, and in some cases probably know, what name is hidden behind the code name Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
In contrast to the domestic, in the meantime very certain inspection of the Stazi components, the manipulation of the legacy of the Securitate control is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic education has been thwarted and curtailed.
One of Birthler's offices, which reports to the National Council for the Processing of Securities (CNSAS), was established only in 1999, the issuance of the acts has been rather lengthy since then.
Only since 2005, there is a law that governs the management of components.
The fact that former members of the Securitate still have a lot of influence in Romania after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller was proved by an interview in which one of the former chiefs of the Securitate from Timisoara spoke in a negative way about the winner of the award.
She says she has psychosis, after all, she's only been interrogated once.
The humiliation of power has been expressed quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, the S<0xC3><0xB6>llner case, as in the case of the silent plea, is bound up with the inevitable questions.
The special reaction of the audience to S<0xC3><0xB6>llner's confession makes one expect that the continuation of this chapter will be determined more by the desire for knowledge than by the admission of guilt and shame.
The genesis of the work of Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
Saturated Deposit Champions League
It looked as if a purely dressed sales representative had come from a cute Christmas party at which the manufacturer of sporting goods handed out sweets as the new VfBr coach Christian Gross, accompanied by the sponsor’s orange-colored bag, was getting into the recalled Mercedes C-Class at a quarter of an hour after midnight.
A man with a striking baldness allowed himself to be driven around in a foreign city because of him.
Otherwise, he could drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and drunk with happiness was a 55-year-old man also a little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow will continue to work.
Or it's just getting started.
In the words of a committed Swiss: "We have reached the eight-finals" in the Champions League thanks to a 3-1 win over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be dazzled by success: it will be a brutally hard fight against descent."
"A far more important task" is ahead of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance from the royal class in Mainz even on an ordinary league day.
And to avoid re-obvious weaknesses after three quick goals by Marica (5th), Tr<0xC3><0xA4>sche (8th) and Pogrebnyaka (11th).
Lotteries
The Champions League semi-finals (matches 16/17 + 23/24 February / rematches 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel’s successor’s frantic rise will thus be preserved.
Not only the supposed healer, who gave the insecure Stuttgart professionals in a short period of time self-confidence, willingness to deploy and the joy of the game.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and encouraged them to be more courageous, explained the Soul Healer Gross so simply sounding successful recipe, which, however, under the influence of the therapist Babbel showed no effectiveness.
He fanned some magic, Babbel fan Jens Lehmann admitted, “when there’s a new impulse in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn’t think possible.”
And Sami Khedira, who after a long break caused by injury, became the best player on the pitch thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the detected "phenomenon" by the proverbial "fresh wind" and the working practices of the new boss: "He is a man who is radical and requires discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
It was obviously missing for Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet been rescued, sports chairman Horst Heldt warns
But VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
As Gross, neither players nor managers want to overestimate the victory against the weakened substitute and completely overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would have won in Glasgow, too, before the ugly wake-up came after a 4-0 defeat at Leverkusen, Khedira thinks.
And sports chairman Horst Heldt reminded that although one goal was achieved in the season, the other one is still far away.
We're not out of the water yet.
The fact that Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after his first home win in three months was due to weekend events that had just come to life in the form of a TV interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the match.
There are decisions made by others and not Jens, Heldt responded to Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
He pitched a weak management to the board and decided to change the coach after pressure from adolescence fans.
Even the fact that his day off was cancelled after the matches, Lehmann described as a sign of lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann’s statements “formulate pure egoism,” Heldt replied, announcing the consequences for the goalkeepers.
Both 40-year-olds will probably not enjoy life anymore.
In any case, they agree with each other that without the work of a decommissioned coaching team, such a strong and combative performance would not be possible.
Babbel and his assistants had a “large share of success,” Heldt and Lehmann say unanimously — and the man with the plastic bag agrees.
FIVB World Heavyweight Championship
Passionate duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked with the words and gestures of world champion Vitali Klitschko.
However, after twelve hard laps, the Ukrainian defended his title in the heavyweight boxing organization WBC.
The judges’ decision was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitaly Klitschko remains the world heavyweight boxing champion.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated American Kevin Johnson on Saturday night in Bern by a unanimous vote on points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko, this is the third successful defense of the title after his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice world champion of WBO and WBC organizations.
Unfortunately, it didn't turn out to be the K.O. everyone was expecting.
Klitschko improved his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice he was defeated due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson was first defeated in the 24th duel.
In front of about 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena, Klitschko drove a 2.02 meter tall duel mainly with his left hand.
Eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who before the duel announced the end of the Klitschko era, but retreated before the blows of the world champion, so Klitschko could not deliver a decisive blow with his dangerous right hand.
In all, passive Johnson had done very little for the challenger and was only trying to get into the next rounds.
He provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, but his blows rarely hit the world champion.
But he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought with Klitschko for a full twelve rounds.
The challenger took care of the uproar in the Swiss capital before the duel.
He insulted Klitschko as a "disgusting zombie" who "doesn't do anything right."
During the weigh-in on Friday, the champ was provoked, pulling his sunglasses from Johnson’s nose “so he could see his eyes.”
The fourth victory after Klitschko's return
Klitschko remained undefeated after his fourth fight after his return on 11 October 2008.
After a nearly four-year hiatus, he defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back his WBC belt, which he had to surrender without a fight.
In that year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and Chris Arreola of the United States in September.
In this fight, I got only one shot and I was physically in good shape, Klitschko explained a quick return to the ring.
His dream remains to defend all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r is the world champion of WBO and IBF organizations.
However, the WBA belt is worn by David Haye, after he dethroned Nikolai Vulajev, 2.13 meters high, in November.
Haye gave up a fight against Klitschko in the summer, which was scheduled for September.
Reportedly, his promotion company is planning a fight against Klitschko at London's Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz Case
Opposition leader J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin called Defence Minister Guttenberg a liar because of bad information about the Kund<0xC3><0xBA>z affair.
The SPD and Linke (Left) call on the Chancellor to explain.
Hamburg/Berlin – According to the latest findings of the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition believes that Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed a deliberate deception.
The minister said that the deadly bombing of two tankers in September was "consciously false", the head of the Green faction, J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin, said on Saturday's ARD news program "Tagesschau".
Let's call it the usual term: lying.
The order to kill was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the essence of the NATO report that Mr Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it emerged that the attack involved not only the destruction of hijacked trucks, but the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
The U.S. airstrike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, resulted in the deaths or injuries of up to 142 people, according to a NATO investigation.
The Greens, the SPD and Linke called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately to the Bundestag and also clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Mrs Merkel must explain whether the strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghan policy of the Bundestag - and, if the Chancellor's Office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin and Green colleague Renate K<0xC3><0xBC>nast have called for it.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The chancellor’s office has no influence on the Bundeswehr’s specific deployment in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts were also voiced about the Ministry’s account of the background of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both Guttenbergs were informed correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the tankers.
Officially, they were supposed to deny the existence of NATO reports and keep secret sensitive details from the minister.
However, it was reported from the vicinity of the two top officials that they had alerted the Ministry of Defense even to several reports, among them a two-page document of the commander-in-chief, Colonel Klein, and a report of the military police.
The Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung reports that Wichert should have asked for clarification in the letter in the meantime.
It is noted that no reply has been received so far.
The ministry did not comment on the complaints on Saturday and pointed out that this will be addressed in the investigative committee of the Federal Assembly, which will be established next Wednesday.
Worlds of Dreams
Some see images in the waking state and hear voices that others do not see and do not hear.
It is not only the mentally ill or drugged that the boundaries between imagination and reality blur.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we may be surrounded by the wildest imaginations and fantasy delusions.
But those who experience dream states in their wakefulness, see and hear things that others do not see and hear, in today’s Western world, pay mostly for a fool or a drug addict, or at least as a freak.
However, such images and voices do not occur only in the mentally ill or in drug intoxication.
The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings, or write novels will make sure that the boundaries between dream, imagination, and reality are blurred from time to time.
Dreams of an altered state of consciousness can occur in all sorts of forms, at best we call them visions, at worst delusions.
Although the initiator and effect may vary, however, the visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet New-Age Carlos Castaneda, shamanic states of delusion, psychosis and hallucinations can be inferred from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions occur when the balance of the brain’s neuronal transmitters — primarily dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine — is disturbed, and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusions occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over it.
The connection between delusion and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since antiquity.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of waking dream, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, stated in 1861 "the great similarity of delusion with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "psychosis, with all the nonsense, delusions, delusions of the senses".
It's the fall of 2001, Henning T. is turning into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and glaringly colorful.
Gravity has no power over it, it hovers at the ceiling of the room.
He's feeling a kick.
Behind him, winged devilish figures with blood-red grimaces, valuing their teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, fiery boots, throw him against the walls, feel the pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices are threatening from the walls and from the radio.
He can no longer tolerate the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. rips two cables from the stereo, loops them into a loop, and attaches it to a hook on the ceiling.
He steps on one of the speakers and puts a loop around his neck.
Jumping.
The loop's working.
Learn, they shout to the choir, tearing his eardrums, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be treated!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD has been activated.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, in addition, he is manic-depressive, takes drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he was married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and the deepest doubt, he says.
Ghosts are a terrible reality.
About one percent of people get schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and in psychiatric clinics it is the second most commonly treated disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most affected individuals can no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, they become in an awakened state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions, or the illusion of persecution.
Especially widespread is the hearing of voices - voices that command, comment or conduct dialogues.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The affected person is not able to distinguish the important from the unimportant, the brain can not filter out disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like a dream, psychosis opens the flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the Department of General Psychiatry at the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
Schizophrenic is at the center of the action, everything has a meaning aimed at him.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, becomes, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot actively form them.
Schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is not usually possible with them, ghosts are a terrible reality, awakening is excluded.
Once in a Lifetime Experience a Hallucination
Unlike in a dream, Fuchss says, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that one perceives in psychosis remains fundamentally preserved."
Deviant thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in a real framework.
Scientists are still puzzled as to why our brains are doing this.
“Exceptional states can cause any person to lose touch with reality in the short term,” Fuchs said.
However, not everyone develops psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists assume that the affected persons have minimal brain damage.
We believe that in the early stages of development there will be damage to the neuronal maturation of the brain, for example, viral diseases of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a puzzle as to how the neuronal system will malfunction, which has not manifested itself in this way for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of psychosis, if there is a disposition to it.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brain shuts down
It is crazy that psychotronics suffer from hallucinations, and in order to get rid of them, they swallow expensive medicines, others give money for drugs to get them, says psychology professor Erich Kasten from L<0xC3><0xBC>beck.
Whether illusions are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a question of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions for ten years, and last year he interpreted his results in his book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf" (The Unreal World in Our Head).
Hallucinations belong to the typical accompanying phenomena of psychoses, but also to surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline personality or depression, often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the brain of a healthy person itself also hallucinates.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of the contents of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They occur when the parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are overactive or under-repressed; when our brain shuts down, or when there is a lack of stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the withdrawal of stimuli, stress, worries about love or other exceptional conditions.
In more recent studies, up to a third of respondents reported having experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends the local grammar school.
A perfectly normal girl, actually.
If it wasn't for the shapes and voices.
At break times, she may be approached by a cooing with long, dark hair.
When she answers, her classmates look at her in surprise - no one but her sees and hears this boy.
This shy girl is considered a dreamer, but Sarah K. does not dream, she knows that.
He is awake, he hears and sees the boy, just as he hears and sees the girl sitting next to him in the bench.
She can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, she likes the boy.
“Am I crazy?” he sometimes asks.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and will disappear again.
At night, the appearances are rather depressing
Often, the illusions are a burden.
When she is sitting in the classroom, she cannot watch the lesson many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just presenting a new classmate, but he explains the mathematical equation to everyone else audible and visible on the blackboard.
At night, the apparitions are rather depressing.
When he waits in his dark room for sleep, which rarely comes too late, he often cannot tell whether he is awake or already asleep, whether the images he sees are grimacing, or a girl with bleeding cuts on her arms and legs appears before her with her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, he's yelling at the characters.
She doesn't tell her parents or friends about it, they'd think she was crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she contacted psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows for sure that she hasn't gone crazy.
Illusions are also the art of despair.
If someone is socially isolated or their stimuli are taken away, they are likely to have hallucinations, Kasten says.
I think that the brain does not have enough work and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she had called her father since she was thinking for herself was not her own father.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations involve the same brain regions that process real sensations and sounds, it's hard for the affected, like Sarah K., to distinguish between delusions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, reality is also displayed there.
Hallucinations are also images that allow the brain to form, which is why they seem so real.”
Kasten also evaluates night dreams as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Compared to schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
The boundary between dream and hallucination
In our world too conscious, the imaginary experience is unfortunately mostly pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Clinic of the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, agonizing disease, but it also brings positivity, creativity - a delusion is also an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhardt studied the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of altered dream consciousness.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams that the person concerned considers to be real and cannot even distinguish them retroactively from the waking state.
Oneiroidal state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, for example, patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience motor paralysis in full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, for example, a persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces life-threatening real situations with his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of borderline state between dream and hallucination.
Because in reality it is not possible to handle a situation, there will be a change of worlds, but the real situation will become present in the imagination.
An intense form of sense support and the transference of the senses into some intolerable situation that enables us humans to pass, in an instant, into a loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memories
Also art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his one-eyed experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (The Exchange of Hearts) as a saving action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when, after a heart valve operation followed by a heart transplant, his consciousness set out on a several-day journey, with his body lying motionless in an intensive care unit.
Claussen plunges into the world he has created, visiting strange times and places: he becomes an old man strapped to a bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobility, which produces intoxicating substances from blood.
He is kidnapped by a Greek on a motorcycle to his homeland, surfs the firn in the Alps on a hospital bed, and meets a Korean mobster.
Immerse yourself completely in the imaginary story, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these inner paths are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a different state, it describes your experience.
Contrary to dreams, the memories of those mental journeys are still clear after years and in insignificant details.
Even brighter and more intense than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience shatters the horizon of our other true experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, oneiroid states, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug intoxication show how fragile even in the waking state our inner images of external reality are.
Any change in the state of consciousness, concludes psychologist Kasten, "can lead to the deformation of what we call reality."
It’s a fact that can also be enriching.
Snow can come.
Burda
At 27 they have to take over the publishing house children
The new head of the publishing house Kallen is a transitional solution: In the long run, Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business to his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
In the future, the holding company will belong to 100% of the family.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his business in the hands of his children for a long time.
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and have a strong will to enter the business, says the 69-year-old SPIEGEL man.
We dealt with the details carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is only asked afterwards.
The question is whether they have the ability to do so.
It is not possible to put 7,500 employees in charge of their children if they are not competent enough.
That would kill both the kids and the business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he had been stepping down from the board of directors since January, appointing Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the Board of Directors at Burda since 1999.
First, he was in charge of technology.
Later, with the Treasury section, responsibility for the company's assets was added, and after the resignation of J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Todenh<0xC3><0xB6>fer, Direct Marketing, Foreigners, Print and Finance were also added.
For the first time, no member of the family is at the head of the publishing house.
Burd's children are 19 and 17, and his son Felix, who would have been 42 today, died a few years ago.
Kallen’s appointment also serves to “bridge 10, 15 years,” Burda said.
In the future, the holding should belong to 100 percent of the family, says Burda.
With regard to the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that even family businesses have no certainty of extinction: "It has always affected companies that got infected by the desire for capital, that speculated and thought they could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had "dreams of world power," Burda said.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, like Springer was, and I don't want to play the world league with Time, these deals are too big.
Comprehensive beauty care
Everything you want in the area of beauty and well-being is at your fingertips.
This is what El Corte Inglés, which has just launched its more than 1,000 m2 Callao Shopping Centre (Madrid), which provides a wide range of body care services.
The wellness department is located on the eighth floor, which houses such prestigious companies as Hedonai engaged in laser hair removal-; Spaxi<0xC3><0xB3>n, areas for relaxation and aesthetic procedures; Luis & Tachi peluqueros; Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane offering natural cosmetics, and others.

Escotes variados
Christmas is approaching, and this is the time when it is advisable to find out what celebrities are wearing and adjust your festive wardrobe to it.
The shape of the cut is very important to emphasize the figure, which must be borne in mind.
We present a few suggestions.
Singer Fergie chose an extravagant and very complicated cut. We do not recommend.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The energy company Endesa, together with the Barcelona City Hall, founded the 'LIVE Office'.
This is a project for the development and promotion of an electric car in the capital of Catalonia.
The LIVE' office (Logistics for the introduction of electric vehicles) establishes and will manage a travel plan for the introduction of electric vehicles in the city and will ensure agreements in the field of mobility, will handle, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electric vehicles, collect opinions and results of activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the aim is to promote this means of transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the project of introducing electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville will also join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government under the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric vehicles.
Energy company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The aim is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan Autonomous Region.
This includes activities related to energy and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative involving Endesa when it comes to the promotion of electric cars.
The company is represented in European standardization teams and actively implements a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a 'calm period' in the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero predicts that Spain's auto industry, the country's main export sector, will face a "rest period".
In the Prime Minister’s 2009 economic report, Zapatero summarised the measures that had been put in place during the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without a competitive plan for the automotive sector, we would face a state of abandonment today, the closure of some of our main manufacturing plants,” he said.
“Thanks to this plan and the desire of individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a period of calm for this industry, which is our main export sector, is expected in the future,” he added.
In this sense, he pointed out that the competitive plan, which forms part of the Integrated Plan of the automotive sector (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernization of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also highlighted government measures to support the requirement and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is being implemented in cooperation with autonomous regions and car brands.
According to the president, this plan allowed for a 6% reduction in the average level of emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and ensured a "significant increase" in registrations, specifically in November by "40 percent".
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first International Salon of Classic Vehicles will be opened in Madrid, which is a meeting place for professionals and amateurs from the world of engines.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters, where more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid there will also be products of all types related to the world of engines.
Exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, real delicacies for collectors and curious people.
Among the companies involved will be the following: Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, renewal; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and renewal; or Cochera Clásicos, a specialized company of Mercedes Benz.
Eligibility tests in the exterior
In addition, the commercial activities of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: holding of concentrations, sports performances, examinations, presentations and competitions.
Eligibility tests will also be carried out on classic cars and motorcycles in the adapted circuit outside the exhibition zone.
Mazda3 i-Stop: preserving the sporty style
Mazda intends to show that environmental friendliness has no negative impact on the sporty style.
That’s why the Mazda3 also has a built-in engine stop and start system – also christened as a stop-start – which is a device that is currently only available with a 2.0-litre 150-horsepower petrol engine.
This second generation Mazda3 is characterized by good characteristics, which it has achieved as a whole.
Surface treatment, vehicle design, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All of these aspects are excellent with the Mazda3.
The front seats, including the driver’s seat, have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely smooth.
Using a set of tools and a console, we conclude that Mazda continues the Japanese trend of developing a futuristic design with many buttons and controls and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style partially reminds us of the style that is also presented by the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that the Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products and, more specifically, with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
As is usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who wish a very comfortable ride.
In addition, it is necessary to mention a large luggage compartment and regular shapes.
So far, the automatic engine stop and start system is only available with a two-liter petrol engine and 150 horsepower and a six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real delicacy. It is very gentle, characterized by a reduced noise level, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the most desirable Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not drive as many kilometers per year should not rule out this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, as it is characterized by greater driving comfort and reduced consumption.
As for the equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
In the case of standard equipment, it is necessary to mention in particular the lane-tracking system (RVM), which prevents the formation of blind spot, traction and stability control, speed control, light-sensitive internal mirror, large-screen on-board computer, parking sensors, separate air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth slit 17 audio zola.
And if the equipment was not enough, this version was equipped withPack Premium, for an additional fee of 1,500 euros: adaptive lights two-xenon and BOSE sound system with a CD holder, in addition to other components.
CONCLUSION
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its category.
It is characterized primarily by the quality of the materials used, its operation and high level of equipment.
In addition, people who do not drive a greater number of kilometers per year can choose this version of the i-Stop, which is only with a 2.0 petrol engine and 150 hp.
The only drawback of this model is its higher price, which is 21.770 euros for the Luxury version and 23.270 euros for the tested version -Sportive-.
For this high price, the Mazda3 offers us a great dose of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'Premier'
L.A. has a red carpet, as soft as the hands of Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.

Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose the dark 'Lady'.
The FonPeek Promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is used only to view mail, without the ability to view a certain type of attachments or surf the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine honored him as one of the products of the year.
It's harder to see him out there, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterized by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount that is paid, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began offering two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other based on a permanently provided free data service, for which, however, it is necessary to pay a six-fold amount for Peek.
FonPeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and at the same time its third transformation.
It is limited as well as its American counterpart, but it brings a surprise.
The monthly price for maintenance is about 12 euros per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People traveling with a smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing borders or impatiently search for a cafe with WiFi (or a Fon connection) so they can view the mail.
The idea of rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience one would need a PhD in physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to be able to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly demanding that roaming tariffs be reduced so that they are accessible to the whole of Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home country.
The fact that such a device as FonPeek (it’s interesting that it still has the name Fon when it doesn’t have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators are starting to think differently and are considering different offers to compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, it offers book downloads and other searches on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and is paid upon purchase, not after months.
And this is exactly what I expect to happen one day in the case ofFonPeek, it is a possibility of purchase with a permanent approach as Peek has already established in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm looking at the mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it is the best type from the consumer's point of view.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used in a computer.
The Color That Michelle Loves
Yellow is the favorite color of the First Lady of the United States.
For Barack Obama’s inauguration as president of the United States, she chose a dress and coat in this color, the same color she chose when accompanying him at the second most important moment of his life: the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to being a similar color - yellow-green with shimmering effects -, in both cases it was a three-piece set - a dress, a bag and a coat of the same fabric - decorated with a large embroidery or a collar.
At first glance, it seemed that the first lady of the United States decided to follow in the footsteps of the Asturian princess and wear similar clothes.
The fabric from which the clothes are made makes the two models significantly different.
On the occasion of taking office, Michelle used a large lace, in Oslo velvet with a print.
It also changes accessories: green shoes with a medium high heel, now a similar model, but in gold color.
He also wears different hairstyles: this onesocks, previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have work-related maternity problems.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who intend to have a child.
This is the result of a study 'Fertility and Career of Spanish Women' conducted by CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The study involved 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities in the labor market because of motherhood.
The study points out that at the beginning of cohabitation, there are many differences in opinions about the number of children depending on whether they work or not, as well as on the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have a stable job, start living with a partner earlier, give birth to their first child earlier, and have more children overall.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, postpone partnership and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
"Women aged 35 to 49 with stable employment have their first child on average 3.7 years since the beginning of cohabitation with a partner. This figure is 4.1 for women who have devoted most of their lives to achieving their stable employment and therefore had to postpone cohabitation and the arrival of children.
The type of occupation also has a strong impact on motherhood, although it has less impact on the time of starting cohabitation with a partner,” explains Margarita Delgado, a researcher at CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of marriage and the birth of a child is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age at which women marry and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group 35 to 49 years, women with primary and higher education gave birth to their first child at the age of 25.1 and 32.1.
“There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with primary education get married and have their first child before they find a stable job, while women with secondary or higher education go the opposite way, preferring to get a stable job, before marriage and the birth of their first child,” Delgado said.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of various products of this brand under the universal slogan 'Because I am worth it'.
A representative of 'Joyeux No<0xC3><0xAB>l', one of the most elegant actresses of the international level, joins other famous personalities of L'Oréal Paris such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('The Shack Millionaire') had joined the club.
The male part of this cosmetics brand is also represented by prominent personalities: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelina's partner in 'The Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say about fashion.
Their most important representatives – designers and models, past and present – gathered for the annual awards ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one was missing in the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model of the year.
Manuel Vicente 's
Manuel Vicent donates thirty X-rays of the writers he met in his literary life (and in some cases in his everyday life) in 'Ace Poker' (Alfaguara, an illustration by Fernando Vicente).
It does not do so in the dreaded and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but seeks something similar to the core of the creative personality.
The journey brings excitement and Vicent does not spare any relief or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reading pleasure, even with repeated reading.
Here are some observations.
On Albert Camus: "In the pages of this book I have found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but it cannot be called: the enjoyment of a counter-judgment, a morality without guilt, and innocence without any god."
Samuel Beckett: "A nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote by his own nature and not by intellect, something between powerlessness and ignorance, with blinding poetic humor, without meaning, as if it were the blade of a knife that nearly killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man has been clothed with a passion for this woman for thirteen years, adultery, pleasure, and remorse, which is a spiritual privilege to attain heaven by way of damnation."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssey was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight-thousand peaks in the universal literature, which must be overcome from the north side, from which the best climbers often fall."
William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
By himself, he said he was the heir of a landowner in the county, and at other times that he was the son of a black woman with a crocodile.
In both cases, it was a great dream.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer caught on the bridge the confused cry of this man from Munich to carry his echo into the night of the 20th century in his literary form, running ahead of himself and calling to the future and speaking sharply to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "Once she knelt down and prayed, 'My God, my beloved, make me stop writing like a woman.'
Of Joseph Conrad: "Spencer's verses were engraved on his grave: 'After the effort comes a dream, after the storm a quiet harbor, after the war rest, after a full life death.'
On Virginia Wolf: "He also carried his depression in his luggage.
Her husband agreed to tell him that Edward VII had been watching her among the azaleas, or that the birds were singing in Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness.
P<0xC3><0xAD>o Baroja: "What else was Martin Santos thinking about but targeting Joyce on Baroja?
What was Benet's point but to have Baroya executed with Faulkner's gun?
What was Cel’s purpose but to make himself famous at the expense of that man’s glory?”
Cowardly Aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in Fuenlabrada County, and a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 passed by and our dog, a cross-breed rescued from a shelter weighing no more than six kilograms, was kicked twice without a word and severely injured.
Our indignation is all the more so because we do not see anything funny in such aggression against a small and defenseless animal, which, moreover, was on the leash.
And the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she encountered these individuals on a walk, began to worry about her own safety, because such a demon-possessed man who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, Tuesday, in the usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog cried all day.
Of course, we have lodged a complaint with the nearest Commission, but we doubt that it was useful, and in order not to raise sensitive questions, we note that these cowardly murderers were of Spanish nationality.
Indignity has led us to declare this fact.
We don’t understand what happens to today’s youth when they entertain themselves by tormenting a defenseless animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We don’t understand where the right manners and respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial jointly for using helmets
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Transport Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially for younger motorists, as both have informed today.
The purpose of this initiative is to emphasise the importance of using a helmet as it is the only means of preventing head injuries or deaths in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin says the campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which “means more than designing and manufacturing even safer products,” and has confirmed that it is working to achieve this goal in other ways, including through an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets while riding a motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', is the first phase in which more than 500 motorcycle repair shops will be placed with signboards to make themselves known to the general public.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that transport safety is a “constant problem” for the company, which is a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheelers and whose main goal is to constantly improve product safety.
Increased sales of light commercial vehicles
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market is starting to recover.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represented an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and what is more, this is the first increase after 22 months of permanent decline, according to figures from the patronage organization of Anfac manufacturers and Ganvam sellers.
However, a favorable figure is better to put in quarantine, since November 2008 is a very bad period for comparison and meant a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, regardless of the increase in the last month, the total number of registered vehicles in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous accounting year.
As of January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible light commercial vehicle categories: passenger car derivatives, pick-ups, vans, smaller trucks and light trucks/chassis.
And the clouds that are most damaging to demand have not disappeared, even if they were bought by private individuals, most of the purchases were made by small and medium-sized companies and almost 100% of the time it is financing through third parties.
In addition to the restrictions resulting from the closure of the source of bank loans, other factors such as the cessation of activity or the continuation of a bad economic situation should be added.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, support for the purchase of 2000E did not help much.
In addition to private persons, it is also necessary to mention the persons doing business on the trade licence of small and medium-sized companies who intend to purchase a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, Ganvam again reminded that special attention should be paid to the management of these vehicles, as well as industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Association of Dealers predicts that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year, and according to calculations, sales for passenger cars and 4x4s will fall by 19%.
The auxiliary system at the handbrake is already a mandatory equipment.
As in the case of the ABS anti-lock system, it will also be with ESP stability control, auxiliary handbrake systems, all this will become mandatory equipment for European cars.
In fact, they are already part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest, a deadline is set for the elimination of the deficiency, which is February 2011.
The measure introduced in the EU aims to increase pedestrian protection, while it works in such a way that it can help prevent many collisions.
The auxiliary handbrake system increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency, which the system detects when the driver steps on.
But it is not always possible to maintain this pressure until the end.
According to a study by auto parts manufacturer Bosch, a third of drivers who have an accident have not braked before a collision, and half of them have not fully used the brake force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires the braking system to the maximum, shortening the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of device, up to 1,100 pedestrian-related fatalities could be prevented per year.
Reducing this number will be even more significant—calculated to avoid one in four accidents with an impact on people—after the introduction of so-called intelligent handbrake systems.
In this case, the vehicle will be equipped with a system that (using radar or camera) detects obstacles and reports them to the driver, in addition to light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help to increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If the driver does not react, even if the collision cannot be prevented, the device will act as intensively as possible on the brake and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors postpones plans for Opel until January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, told Opel employees in Figueruelas, Zaragoza, that production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April – probably on April 8 – as Javier Ortega informed, the American manufacturer points out that it will take more time to meet the recovery plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to get every point of the plan agreed with the party concerned first.
As a result, it may happen that the final document, which will be presented first to employees and then to the governments of the countries where the production plants are located, will be issued late in early 2010.
GM, on the other hand, assures that the decision to sell Saab should be taken these days.
No wonder the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM allows contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also wants to acquire Volvo, but is considering the possibility of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which operates under the auspices of the Russian group Converg.
In the event that no agreement can be reached with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab’s assets to Chinese company Baic.
Saab will close at the end of the year if it fails to sell.
Driving with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In developing this magnificent model, Porsche engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, so the weight shows only1,275 kg.
On the basis of it was, first of all, the automatic retractable roof is in a canvas version with manual control, which reduced the weight by 21 kg; then were used aluminum doors such as the GT3, which means an additional 15 kg less; removal of air conditioning, 13; reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 12 liters, the sport also contributed to the reduction of the weight of the kits by another 7 kg;
Finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less, and replacing the door handles with textile handles means another kilogram.
Also available with PDK dual-clutch transmission, one vehicle with a manual six-speed gearbox was tested, mainly on second-class roads in California, on mountain sections with many intricate bends.
His behavior can only be qualified as untouchable.
Reducing weight does not mean that the vehicle is not pressed to the asphalt.
On the contrary: we have not tested such a small and lightweight model for a long time, which would also transmit such safety when moving in a corner, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete able to warm up his muscles during a short ride for the time needed until we order him to sprint, brake, and resume using the engine...
Whatever we want. Thanks to the steering, which is as communicative as it is precise, whatever we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Sound of the engine at will
The sound of the V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S), is very successful and can be amplified by the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine that was previously used in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether during suction or recuperation.
Curtains are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads that we pass with the Boxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car coped well with the potholes.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; and in some corners we encountered frost and gravel at dawn even in the advanced morning.
Definitely, this ultra-lightweight car is one of the most fun on the market, as it is a little more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 at a price of 70,831 euros.
'Bag Girl'
Karel Lagerfeld’s girlfriend, Coco Cocoon icon and occasional ‘starlette’ at ‘company’ shows, the singer shows her face to the evil girl as vehemently as her Chanel handbags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia won a victory in Israel
She won a brilliant victory in 82-91 during her stay on the complicated Maccabi Electra course, despite numerous absences in the Duska Ivanovice team, and thus became the leader of her group after the big performance of Mirza Teletovice, who with eight triple points was declared the best in the team (29).
Vitoria's team was able to replace the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Mic with a large dose of commitment and teamwork, although they had to suffer to the end to win the victory.
In addition, great accuracy from the circuit with 16 triple points contributed a lot to the final triumph.
The match began with the front for the blues, who stood up to the brand from the beginning.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance already indicated that they had attacked the Israeli team very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alava team opted for the inner game of Baraca and the work of Eliyahu, who was received with a whistling and applause upon returning to his original post to increase the advantage before the break began (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to show himself as the best in his team with 13 points, although 'without six' in the Splitter rating already indicated that this would not be the best evening for the Brazilians.
But even though the match was sharp until the break, it was not decided in the slightest, and the Maccabees wanted to remind Vitoria that not everyone wins on their pitch, and 'by the hand of El<0xC3><0xAD>as' they were able to win.
Eidson and Pnini certainly contributed to the return of the "yellows" to the limelight (50-49).
More inappropriate
The members of Ivanovic, wounded but not dead at all, needed a few precision games to catch their breath, and then the Mirza Teletovic machine gun appeared, which with three triples almost in a row and with the help of English and Ribase returned the score to a calming number (54-67), which was reached by the locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alawites have skinned themselves in the last part, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not allow anyone to deprive them of the well-deserved results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for a foul, the Ivanovics did not rush and defended well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the match already had a winner andTel Aviv lost for the first time in a season.
Injuries make it impossible for Unicaja to fight
Unicaja lost significantly in Greece to Olympiacos and left him the lead of Group B in the Euroleague in a match that was marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but above all by an internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not afraid of the environment of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or of an opponent, perhaps one of the sickest in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. Aggressive defense and three triple points in a row, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubio, brightened the pitch s12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the local arsenal in the internal game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment when the battle between the supports from USABeverley and Williams meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek team began to operate and proved its superiority in both zones, where the absence of an English pivot due to the injury of Joel Freeland and three personal mistakes of Carlos Jiménez burdened the Unicaja team.
Between internal players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas with triple points increased the advantage to 44-32, minute 19.
The Impossible Retaliation
The third part was very offensive on the part of Olympiacos, who despite losing by 19, showed superiority and even managed to make up the difference from the match in Malaga Málaga 66-48, a minute 27 that shook the leadership in the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and last absence of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
Despite all the disadvantages of Unicaja thanks to the lead and triple points Cook and the contribution of Lewis left some hope n win 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible, because Olympiacos, thanks to the strengthening and predominance in centimeters in his zone, proved that he was unstoppable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to equalize the average 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja withered and handed over the leadership of Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can get acquainted with the salary they deserve for their profile, thanks to the new Trovit application, the search engine with the largest number of classified ads in the field of real estate, employment and motor vehicles in Spain.
The How much should you take? tool calculates the salaries of users based on the more than 140,000 job offers Trovit has in Spain, using a form available on Facebook, where the profession, years of experience, age and city where the candidate wishes to work.
During the week that the app worked, the search engine found that the Spanish worker generally “feels badly rewarded,” explained Albert Rivera in his report responsible for the Trovit product.
According to data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the worst paid.
The British programmer takes <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45.226 gross per year and the French <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31.059, while the Spaniard gets <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>24,000.
Similarly, the driver is paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>34,247 net per year in England, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25,751 in France and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is that of a waiter with 11,592 euros net per year, followed by a salesman with 14,725 euros and a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are driver, part-time job and social worker.
Brazil has set a date for Zelaya’s departure.
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to remain at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic mission no later than January 27, 2010, when his mandate officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, the charge d’affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to Globo TV that Mel knows he must leave the embassy by that date, where he has been hiding since September 21.
"He is aware that on January 27th, after the end of his mandate, he must leave and seek another refuge."
The station also quoted a former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, that same week he tried to take refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed because Zelaya refused the political asylum condition that the de facto government chaired by Roberto Micheletti had sought to impose on him.
Thank you.
After days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has resurfaced in the markets, which should come as no surprise, as it is already a natural state in an environment where executives are making decisions about a future that is uncertain in itself.
The drug used by central banks to stabilise the market was debt monetisation through the direct purchase of assets and the indirect release of liquidity at near-zero rates, so that financial institutions could purchase assets to be deductible.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have virtually ended, and without calling into question their divergent liquidity policies, they are starting to throw some sand into the gears, as the Spanish Central Bank did with its auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to sustain an economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are participating in the return of a reduction in risk returns.
Stock market mobility and bond differences have regained points, although they are still very far from the abnormal level they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk, which again affected public debt.
Quality is under pressure again, and the US, Japan and Germany have become the haven chosen by investors, which has widened the differentiation of eurozone countries towards Germany.
Spain was almost unaffected by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of the Kingdom of Spain's qualification reduction.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not useless for silencing the moral hazard advocates who have tried once again to burden the consciences of those responsible for world economic policy by curbing the devastating effects of the employment credit restriction, when in fact it would be necessary to declare a new day of thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai represents a tribal struggle between emirs for the restoration of power in the emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen this before.
A government covering up deficits, elections and a new government is coming.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and S<0xC3><0xB3>crates in Portugal after Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro member country to default on its commitments.
What makes sense, however, is for Ecofin to force the Greek government to be transparent and to hold its own citizens jointly accountable when emergency measures are needed to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are ahead of the period of normalisation of transition risk premiums, some excesses in supported positions would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our public debt differences will increase as well as the bonds of European companies, we need not worry.
If Europe's differences are reduced and ours are further expanded, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's issue is just an anecdote. When our leading indicators force most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise their upswing scenario for 2011, including OCDE and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, it does not bode well for the Spanish economy to live up to this warning.
Again, it looks like it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, albeit for the time being "careful, my driver's friend".

Iberdrola President Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to intervene before the subcommittee of the Chamber of Deputies, where Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades is being discussed these days.
Following his intervention, followed by a speech by President Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán provided the press with a few remarks regarding the proposal he had submitted to the Subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrola, Spain needs an investment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50,000 million by 2020 and another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60,000 million from that date by 2030 if the nuclear power plants that are currently in operation are preserved.
If this did not happen, the necessary investments would not be 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
Indeed, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international connections.
From 2020, the issue is changing and performance will need to be increased.
Its offer focuses on gas and coal-fired power plants with carbon capture mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this case, it believes that a new 18,000 MW is needed, but with other "supporting energies".
Galán, who believes the government-approved Sustainable Economy Bill is in line with the line the company has demanded, did not want to let go as a royal decree to promote the consumption of national coal, which goes against climate change policy.
In his view, a “clear long-term bet” in this sense, despite the “precise” measure, as President Iberdrola called it.
Be that as it may, Galán believes that investment decisions, albeit long-term, need to be taken now, as their maturation is ongoing and a stable tax framework is needed to initiate them.
Ferrovial wins ‘handling’ Aer Lingus at 10 airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for airport ground services, Swissport, will act as the preferred freight partner for Ireland’s Aer Lingus airlines at the ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement, from which no economic terms have yet emerged, is valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a cooperation protocol yesterday to create a Center for Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures.
The association anticipates an investment of 20 million by 2012, 50% of which goes to Ferrovial.
One of the Centre’s tasks will be to research energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona seeks its first motorway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first motorway concession in Australia, a market where it already operates as an energy and water utility.
The tunnel in question is estimated to be worth 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
Its rivals are the French firm Bouygues and the German company Hochtief.
The 5-kilometer tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a construction and concessional highway enterprise.
City Hall wishes to have the tunnel completed by the end of 2014
After selecting public-private cooperation (PPP according to the initials in English) for the further development of the project in the business plan protected by Erns & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the construction and operation of tolls.
Bids are expected to be submitted in May, with an expected investment of AU$1,700 million (EUR1,047 million) and, in the final phase, three companies with a significant presence in European construction.
Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The former is one of Australia’s largest construction companies and the latter, based in Italy, is one of Europe’s largest underground construction specialists.
Against the Acciona Group is the Northern Direct Group, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last group to go through the network is called LBRJV, and it is owned by the Australian capital Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, represented here by ACS), as well as the local Baulderstone (owned by the German Bilfinger Berger Group) and an important company specializing in civil construction Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large-scale construction and privatisation, but carries with it a clear difficulty of entry other than the intermediary acquisition of a local construction firm.
The strategy followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger is, in addition to Asian references, still an example for Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS acquired a market position through its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of the quoted Leighton.
million-dollar assets
Acciona relies on the geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination trade.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and leads a group of companies that build and manage desalination plants in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use the common energy to enter the areas of construction and operation of infrastructures.
An underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane Infrastructure Authority, called the Northern Link, is to connect the western motorway from Toowong to the Kelvin Grove ring road (see map) in the length of 5 kilometres of the tunnel. This is the largest action to reduce the traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The calendar set by the local government plans to be commissioned for the summer of 2010 and the start of work for December next year.
Although this paid passage would open in the last months of 2014, the full completion of the works is planned for 2016.
The tunnel was started in 2005.
It will include two streams in each direction, an electronic toll system and a comprehensive ventilation system.
The government of Queensland will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to finance it.
Brisbane has already offered this contract to Hochtief
Australia is still making a significant profit, as it announced a contract with the government yesterday estimated at 154 million.
Through its local subsidiary Leighton, the shared ACS will put into operation the national broadband network infrastructure with fiber optic cable.
This situation will allow fast access to the Internet for 400,000 people and will provide the work of a German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company abandoned the 27-story King George Tower project in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work was yet to begin, and Hochtief closed the sale for $129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will be involved with Laing O’Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
The FCC has allocated a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has received a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>64.5 million grant for the construction of a 2.1 kilometre long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia.
The company was awarded the contract a few days after the completion of work on the extension of the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
Work is scheduled to start in early 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Sr. Rushmore got an ad in Renfe
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services for the past two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore for an estimated amount of three million euros a year, according to the company operating the railway.
The contract includes the possibility of a 12-month extension each year. Sra. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies that presented themselves in the competition announced by Renfe, of which four advanced to the finals, among them TBWA , which was responsible for creating advertising for the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will take care of the design and production of the campaigns.
France Telecom fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million for slowing competition
France’s competition regulator has fined France Télécom <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in Caribbean regions that belong to the country.
According to this institution, the operator has reduced competition between fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programs with consumers on the verge of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has bought more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>560 million in fines since 1994 for putting obstacles in the way of its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was increased de facto because the competition watchdog believes that France Télécom has committed a similar offence as in the past and that there has therefore been a recurrence.
App Store
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company is still a star among other operators and has opened an app store on the Internet in order to increase revenues that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the start, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for entry into other countries such as Spain.
Play in the Champions League brought from the beginning of 476.4 million Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a
The Champions League has been a source of income for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned $476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth highest-earning clubs in the competition.
The charter is led by Manchester United.
The charter is led by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only bring glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
To the extent that the competition distributed <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5.362.5 million among 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) that have participated in this event since the inception of the tournament in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The White Club was third on the continent with the most money received for participation, and the only one, along with AC Milan, to win the top prize three times.
The current champion of Catalonia and the last winner of the 1992 European Cup is fifth in the classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that charged the most money for participation in the last Champions League.
She lost both of them to Barca.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country to win the most money through Champions, despite having won the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution (disambiguation)
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-distribution procedure used by UEFA.
For this financial year, the body, chaired by Michel Platini, plans to earn $1,090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA allocates 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the preliminary classification round (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, the participants received 3.8 million just for their presence, in addition to an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>550,000 for each match they participate.
There is also a prize for winning (800,000 euros) and for drawing (400,000 for each team). The eight finalists will receive three million each; eight quarter-finalists3.3 million.
Each of the last four gets $4 million.
The champion earns 9 million, while the second finalist earns 5.2 million.
Thus, the club earns a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million on fixed payments.
On the other hand, Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a won 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, however, there are moving payments, for which 337.8 million are earmarked.
This money is divided according to the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main ones and has four assigned places.
The champion from last year will receive 40% of the allocated money, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>61 million for 29.9% Sos
Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday announced the details of the offer to buy shares, with the help of which it wants to gain a top spot between 25% and 29.9% of the Sos capital.
This percentage does not oblige to make a public offer for the acquisition (option) of all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.5025 per share, which it would pay in ten years and for which interest would pay for this delay of 1% per year.
Yesterday, the shares of Sos ended trading at 1.85 euros; therefore, Nueva Rumasa’s offer is rated by the company at 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of the Sauce.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the board.
The Jerez Group gives 15 days for shareholders to announce their interest in selling the shares.
CNMV stated that it had not been informed of the offer, although Ruize Mateose confirmed that it had contacted the regulatory authority.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, the sauce continues to change the structure of its leadership.
As an attempt to stay on the fringes of possible bids to buy and settle the judicial wrangling of its former leaders, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, it was announced that Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Luisa Jorda had been elected as head of the internal audit.
This decision makes her the first woman to hold a high position in a food business.
It is a newly created place, which will be directly subordinate to the president of the group.
And it is not exempt from the controversy, as the business continues to be mired in a legal battle over the alleged transfer of more than 230 million from the Sos to the Salazar brothers’ companies.
In fact, it is impossible to scrap the possibility that in the coming months the Sauce will reveal new fund transfers
As for the Salazars’ credit, yesterday at the National Court, former members of the council Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) testified and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV authorises the option to exclude Paternin, who participated in Inversora Mer
Yesterday, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) allowed the exclusion, which Inversora Mer participates in, against Federico Paternin on October 9.
The Supervisory Authority explained that it authorises this operation as it understands that its conditions are in line with the applicable standards and considers that the content of the explanatory brochures submitted following the 2 December amendments is "sufficient".
CNMV specified that the offer is aimed at acquiring 550,008 shares of Federico Paternin’s stock at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of the company’s capital, which consists of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been immobilised which could not be transferred in any way until the offer specified that the price had been fixed by Federico Paternin in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards had been concluded.
New tools for valuing cars
In these days of storms and accidents earn not only car repair shops.
Each day, thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance claim are towed to a repair shop where an expert must estimate the damage and repair costs.
No insurance event is the same, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complex job.
Calculate repair costs manually from 20,000 to 30,000 euros including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service providers and insurance and maintenance forecasting solutions are dedicated to gathering information from manufacturers to then develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the American group Solera, is a leading company; 80% of the evaluations are carried out with its products.
Other companies that compete in the field of valuation tools and the development of information about the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is not at all easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Director of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers work in Spain and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is still growing, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been introduced in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
Once a new vehicle enters the market, these businesses will start operating.
This is a very hot job, because it is necessary to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and set its price.
In addition, for each model, "intelligent" graphic processing is carried out, where it is possible to "punch out" individual parts of tourist cars.
As for the model with massive sales, the work can be done in a week, if the process is very fast.
As for the minority car, it can take three or four months. At present, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models they have information about are Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
In terms of mobile park in circulation, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the work of documenting and developing databases, Audatex has eight centers divided around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national seat is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>90 million a year in the development of these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are included and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this immense stream of information enables businesses to use and provide different products in different ways.
The most common uses focus on repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing spare parts or for calculating the sales or residual value of the car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer them in our country, but in the United States they do.
Taking into account the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get support that can be used by professionals in the sector.
This business offers ten different tools, with AudaPlus as the star product, a standard insurance event valuation solution designed for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the repair time estimated by the manufacturer or paint shop.
This instrument shall be applied according to the application for each assessment.
The maximum price is 5.75 euros for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
After that, each insurance company that makes thousands of estimates negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow complete identification of the vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly line, only on the basis of the first number of the chassis.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to decommission vehicles with a total insurance claim.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying tendencies, performing geodemographic analyses or detecting deviations by brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many models of a particular brand have been serviced due to an accident or how many have suffered a serious insurance event over a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
Among other things, it sells the Gt Estimate, which is also designed for connoisseurs and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official manufacturer times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group founded in 1971 as a service provider and solution for the assessment of damages, accidents or car maintenance.
Gt Gu<0xC3><0xAD>a Valuation is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 service users, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Turnover increased by 20% per annum over the last three years and in 2008 they charged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization began with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its brother is established in Europe and 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 in Spain.
The global billing of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company earns 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed at $1,000 million, and now its shares are estimated to total $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auction of crashed vehicles
Last October, the Solera Group bought Autoonline, an online base for selling cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insurance event.
The operation assumed the subscription of 59.5 million euros out of 85% of the company’s capital, which could be expanded next year by the remaining 15%.
The aim of the purchase was to provide more value-added services to customers with access to a huge international market.
This valuation and buying and selling service is guaranteed exclusively to professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, repair shops, spare parts sales and professional dealers who have to register before operations begin.
The platform was founded in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among the main markets stands out Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The site currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 connoisseurs.
It manages 3,000 daily ads and about 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
Under Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been decommissioned cannot be put back into service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles with historical value may be allowed to operate, even if they have been decommissioned, after a preliminary procedure.
Service budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user gets the budget in only four steps: vehicle identification, finding a spare part, creating a budget and generating a budget.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially for the conviction of older professionals who are more or less reserved in the use of new management techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourist, 109 off-road, 137 motorcycles, 78 deliveries and 44 trucks.
Naturally, for use, you need a computer with an Internet connection.
After identifying the model to be repaired, using the chassis number, a real graphical representation of the model appears, and then the necessary spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, surcharges or discounts, and then print and hand over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service-oriented and does not include a workforce estimate.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
At present, Audatex is working to ensure that these images are three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics welcome, because it allows, for example, to select a door and turn it to display the inner side.
