But first of all, I think we need to add in such a component as martial arts.

China strongly opposes the adoption of the US “Taipei bill”
China strongly opposes the U.S. adoption of the so-called “Taipei bill,” which seriously violates the one-China principle and the principles of the three China-U.S. joint communiqués.
This was stated on Friday by the official representative of the Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China for Taiwan Ma Xiaoguan.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s approval of the bill is also a serious violation of international law and fundamental principles of international relations and a gross interference in China’s internal affairs, said Ma Xiaoguang.
According to him, Taiwan is part of China, and related issues relate to the internal affairs of China.
“We call on the American side to clarify the situation, immediately stop promoting relevant negative bills, and immediately stop interfering in the Taiwan issue in order to avoid further damage to China-US relations, as well as peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” he said.
China must and will be reunified.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by anyone or any force, said Ma Xiaoguan.
TikTok hides unwanted videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18.
Imagine China / Reuters
Chinese social network TikTok is censoring videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibet’s independence or the outlawed Falun Gong religious group.
According to documents obtained by the publication, the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) uses the application to promote the goals of China’s foreign policy abroad.
The bulk of China’s policy violations fall under “hate speech.”
In each case, TikTok places objectionable posts in a context appropriate to the general rules, so that the actions of the social network do not look censored.
For example, the ban on criticizing the socialist system of China falls under the general ban of "criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.".
The ban on mentioning incidents in Tiananmen Square or the genocide in Cambodia falls under the “distortion of the history of China or other countries”.
The document also lists the banned names of twenty “foreign leaders or statesmen,” including North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, U.S. Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park
Prohibited material is divided into two categories, the document says.
Posts from the first category are deleted by the administrators of the social network and may lead to the blocking of the user.
Not too strict violations belong to the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.
Representatives of ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer apply: “We are now using a localized approach for moderation, as well as attracting independent local specialists.”
Russian TikTok users have no specific restrictions on publication, says Rustem Bogdanov, co-founder of the Production Center.
Production Center is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All advertising materials of bloggers "Production Center" agrees with the representatives of the social network, but user materials can be placed without agreement, Bogdanov reports.
When asked whether TikTok can speak about politics or Putin, Bogdanov answers in the affirmative and says that he has seen such publications.
Roman Zaripov, founder of Our Digital, agrees with Bogdanov: "The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: you can not post shocking content, discriminatory statements, and so on."
But under these rules, you can bring any content that does not like the moderators, says Zaripov.
Zaripov Agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under the age of 18.
By user agreement, TikTok can only be used by persons over 13 years of age.
The administrators of the social network check their age with the help of artificial intelligence: the neural network analyzes faces and determines how old a person looks, Bogdanov says.
If the neural network decides that the user is younger, his account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of WeWork coworking.

A child in the Rostov region was amputated because of a mistake of doctors, reports "Vzglyad" with reference to the site of the territorial body of Roszdravnadzor.
An 11-year-old boy broke his arm, after which he was plastered in a hospital in the Zernograd district.
After a while, the child developed gangrene, an amputation was performed.
As a result of the inspection, it turned out that there were violations of the timeliness and correctness of the diagnosis, as well as the standard and volume of assistance provided.

Russians warned about fake calls from banks
In Russia, the number of calls from fraudsters who replace the phone number of the bank has increased.
This is reported by Kommersant with reference to the data of the Central Bank.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator provided telecom operators with information on more than 2,500 numbers from which customers of various financial organizations called.
In 189 cases, operators found a replacement number.
Another 218 numbers were blocked, and in 59 cases a restriction on the use of financial services was set.
Deputy Head of the Information Security Department of the Central Bank Artem Sychev said that a wide range of Russian banks faced the change of number.
He explained that operators do not always respond to the warnings of the Central Bank about fraudulent calls, referring to the lack of such an obligation in the law "On Communications".
In the Bank "Opening", Rosbank and Alfa-Bank confirmed the information about the increase in the number of fraudulent calls with the change of number.
As reported in the press service of “Beeline”, part of the information about fraudulent calls, which was transmitted to the Central Bank, was incorrect: the lists included numbers that are really used by banks to communicate with customers.
Their blocking would lead to disruptions in the work of the organization.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a database of numbers of fraudsters, to which the operator will address every call to check the number.
He explained that in order to establish such a base, the legislation would need to be amended.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky discussed Ukraine’s membership in the alliance on the sidelines of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
He said this during a speech at Columbia University in New York.
Answering the question whether the relevant topic was raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg said that they really discussed this issue, and also stressed that in his response he did not name the dates of Ukraine's accession to NATO.
According to him, any country that would like to join the North Atlantic Alliance is obliged to fulfill certain conditions in order to meet specific standards.
In the Crimea offered Zelensky an alternative course to NATO
The President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky instead of the course to join NATO should be engaged in the establishment of good-neighborly relations with Russia.
This was announced on Friday, September 27, the co-chairman of the Assembly of Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea Roman Chegrinets.
“Mr. President of Ukraine does not need to repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, but should listen to the advice of [US President] Donald Trump, which he listened to with a sour face, and to establish relations with the President of Russia,” Chegrinets told RIA Novosti.
Chegrinets noted that Zelensky is a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
According to him, the Ukrainian president will be able to remain in power only in case of establishing relations with the Russian Federation.
Earlier on September 27, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that he had a conversation with Zelensky on the topic of the country's accession to the alliance.
According to him, Ukraine is obliged to fulfill certain conditions for this.

Money is more important than football.
Barcelona is blackmailing Neymar
Barcelona and its former footballer Neymar are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the move of the striker to the French "Paris Saint-Germain".
The case almost went to trial, but the Catalans offered the player to resolve the dispute without the intervention of Themis.
Otherwise, they refuse to return.
Neymar and his cunning father, who is also an agent of the Brazilian, started an interesting focus: according to the agreement with Barca, which the player signed in 2016, he was to receive 40 million euros.
However, just a year later, the forward was in PSG for a record 222 million euros.
However, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Moreover, the Brazilian’s lawyers insist that the club owes him interest for late payment.
When Neymar’s claims became known in the Catalan capital, Barcelona filed a counter-claim.
The Blue Pomegranates insist that the bonus was due for the performance of the entire contract - from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player was only a quarter of 40 million euros and require a return of the proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer Neymar and Barca almost agreed on the return of the “prodigal” player in the bosom of Catalonia.
True, the deal fell through, but the hope for the return of the forward remains.
And now, as reported by Sports.Ru with reference to insiders, the club's lawyers told the player's representatives that if the issue of financial claims is not settled in pre-trial order, this will exclude the possibility of the return of the Brazilian.
Neymar himself wants to return so much that he asked for guarantees that the Catalans would buy him back.

54-year-old Curtis Miller (Curtis Miller) was digging in a pile of garbage near an empty house.
This was noticed by Todd Beavers (Todd Beavers) who went out for an evening walk.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black cart among the garbage.
Miller saw Beavers's find and was upset.
He believed that he could claim the cart, as he was the first to dig in the garbage.
The men began to argue.
Suddenly, Beavers grabbed the cart and ran with it to the side of his house.
Then Miller took the samurai sword he found in the same pile and began to pursue the opponent.
He caught up with Beavers near his house.
Miller grabbed the sword from his knives and began waving it toward the cart snatcher.

Mass riots in three
The “Moscow case” against the participants of the summer protests the further, the more noticeably it falls into separate fragments and loses its political content.
The evidence of the “mass riots” itself does not stand up to scrutiny, but in the absence of a political decision to put the case on the brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the dismissal of the charges.
The collapse of the case should inspire society, but it will surely leave in the extreme irritation of the security forces, whose efforts to fill the case with defendants and evidence proved to be in vain.
On Thursday, September 26, one of the three remaining defendants in the case under Article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass riots) - Alexey Minyaylo was suddenly released from custody without any obligations, and a few hours later and completely rehabilitated: the ICR dropped the charges against him.
Minyaylo spent almost two months under arrest, several professional communities stood up for him at once: historians, priests, writers.
After that, only two accused of participating in mass riots remained in the case (originally there were 13 accused): Sergei Fomin, who was transferred to house arrest on September 3, and Samariddin Rajabov, who the court extended his arrest until the end of December (he is also accused of using violence against a government representative, Art. 318 of the Criminal Code).

Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help prolong youth?
The topic of phytoandrogens is poorly studied.
The most famous is the pine pollen.
But phytoestrogens are well studied and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risks of certain diseases associated with age (among them cardiovascular, some types of cancer).
Known sources of phytoestrogens are all legumes (the most popular is soybeans), hops, flax seeds.
However, many experts believe that such dietary supplements can not be a full replacement for natural hormones.
It is impossible to exclude the possible harm from such additives.
For example, against the background of their reception, the production of their own hormones may decrease due to the fact that too many analogues from outside enter the body.

He has a great history and great fans.
I wish them all the best and I believe that the city authorities will return their home club to them!” – wrote Veretennikov in Instagram.

Hydrometeorological Center called true folk signs
In Russia, there are many popular signs by which people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
In the Hydrometeorological Center checked all the signs that supposedly work.
Meteorologists have come to the conclusion that only two of them can really be trusted, however, in the short term.
As the scientific head of the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia Roman Vilfand said, if the sun is red during sunset, the next day will be really nice, as our ancestors noted.
If the sky is white, it will rain the next day.
The second working omen is based on the observation of birds.
More often they talk about swallows, if they fly low, then it is usually raining.
It is explained simply - when the humidity is high, the midgets wet their wings and the birds are forced to descend to hunt insects, writes TASS.
On different continents have their own folk signs.
Groundhog Day is a traditional national holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on February 2.

Unidentified oil spills found on beaches in northeastern Brazil
Oil spills of unknown origin have been found on 99 beaches in northeastern Brazil.
The pockets of pollution were scattered over two thousand kilometers of coastline.
Reports of the first discovered oil spills began to arrive on September 2.
However, every day until Thursday, their number, as well as territorial coverage, continued to increase.
The Brazilian Environment Institute conducted a chemical analysis of the samples identified.
It turned out that all of them are identical and we are talking about crude oil.
The state oil corporation Petrobras, which was transferred for analysis of the samples found, said that their composition does not correspond to oil extracted from fields in Brazil.
“This is heavy oil.
It can be dropped from one of the ships after cleaning the tanks.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely it got into the ocean current,” said the coordinator of the union of oil workers of the states of Pernambuco and Para<0xC3><0xAD>ba, Rogerio Almeida, told the Brazilian news portal G1.
He also added that despite the ban on this practice, many ships continue to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states of the north-east of the country, environmentalists found nine sea turtles completely covered with oil film.
Only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Environment Institute, together with Petrobras, will begin cleaning polluted beaches.
In the meantime, the specialists of the Institute recommend tourists and local residents to bypass oil spills and notify about all detected pockets of pollution.

Russians have nothing to save for retirement - V. Matvienko
The speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko believes that the Russians do not have enough savings for the country to fully earn a bill on a guaranteed pension product.
The practice of increasing pensions through personal savings in the world is quite common.
Another thing is how timely it is for us to introduce it.
"In my opinion, now a significant part of the population has income, from which they simply have nothing to allocate to increase pension provision in the future," Matvienko said.
The Russians, according to the speaker, can not understand the mechanisms of formation and calculation of pensions, because "constant changes in this area have finally confused them."
This does not mean that I am against the improvement of the pension system regulating its legislation.
"Russia is a social state, and we must do everything to improve the size of pensions and social security of citizens.
But steps in this direction should be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account domestic realities," Matvienko told RIA Novosti.
The head of the SF stressed that if this initiative (the bill on a guaranteed pension product) will develop, then several basic principles must necessarily be provided, including voluntariness, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and strict guarantees and responsibility of the state for ensuring the safety of pension savings.
On September 6, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced the sending of a bill on a guaranteed pension product (GPP) for approval.
Its main elements include an exceptionally voluntary procedure for citizens to join the savings system, ensuring the safety of long-term pension savings of citizens by the state, registration of accumulative accounts of citizens by the central administrator, tax breaks for business and tax deductions for citizens.
Spider-Man is still in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Sony and Disney have agreed.
Image caption Getty Images image caption News of the departure of beloved superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe has angered many devoted fans
One of the most famous comic book characters - Spider-Man - will remain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Disney and Sony Pictures managed to agree on the rights to use it in the films of the franchise.
This became known from the press release of Sony, which says that the third part of “Spider-Man” with Tom Holland will be released on July 16, 2021.
Earlier it was reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not come to a consensus on the division of income, which is why "Spider-Man" will leave the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
The rights to the film are owned by Sony.
She leased them for the Marvel movies, which are owned by Disney.
As a result, Sony received revenue from the box office, and Disney - from souvenirs and toys.
As reported, at some point, this situation ceased to suit Disney, and the company wanted to reconsider the agreement.
Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said he was thrilled.
It’s amazing that Spider-Man’s journey into the Marvel Cinematic Universe will continue.
“All of us at Marvel Studios are very excited to be able to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is an iconic figure.
This is a hero whose story touches all generations and audiences around the world,” he said in a statement.
At the same time, Feige recalled that Sony is creating its own cinematic universe, built just around Spider-Man.
“It so happened that he was the only super-powerful hero who was in different movie universes.
So, as long as Sony continues to develop its own Spidey universe, the future may present unexpected surprises,” he said.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently commenting on the news, posted on his Instagram account an excerpt from the film “The Wolf of Wall Street”, in which the hero of Leonardo DiCaprio shouts “I’m not leaving!”
Information about the contradictions between the companies appeared in August.
As reported by the media, Disney wanted to receive half of the box office revenue from the films about Spider-Man, provided that both companies will pay half of the costs for the production of paintings.
But that didn’t sit well with Sony.
The news of the possible departure of the beloved superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe has angered many devoted fans.
Details of the new conditions have not yet been disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony declined to comment on the deal, but said: “We’ve been doing great together for the last four years and our shared desire to continue working together has been commensurate with the wishes of many fans [of Spider-Man].
We are happy that we can move forward together.”
The film “Avengers: Finale”, which brought together Spider-Man, Thor, Hulk and other Marvel superheroes, became the highest-grossing in the history of world cinema, moving from the first place “Avatar”.

The expert told why it is necessary to refuse tea in bags
A group of scientists from Canada, representing McGill University, found that when you brew a tea bag in a cup for five minutes gets more than ten billion particles of microplastics.
Particles of sawdust can also be added to the packaged drink, food safety expert Elizaveta Tikhonova told Nation News.
According to the agronomist, the consumer can not get reliable information about the composition of packaged tea - the manufacturer can add ingredients there that will not be indicated on the package.
Sawdust at the end of the season is not thrown away, so they can be in tea.
"Moreover, tea plants are not always included in tea bags," Tikhonova said.
According to her, it is better to abandon the use of such a drink in favor of tea on weight, which is sold in specialized stores.
In addition, she stressed that the danger of packaged tea is not only in the composition, but also in the method of its production - microparticles are heated to high temperatures, because of which they can begin to emit harmful substances.
"It is best to buy pure green or black tea - in such a drink will be the least additives," - said the expert.

Regions offered to share secrets of business support
On September 27, Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy Andrey Kutepov sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin and the Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov with a proposal to express a position on initiatives of the constituent entities of the Federation to improve legislation in the field of support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
It is time to establish interregional relations
The Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy summarized the information received from the regions on their business development and legalization programs, as well as the results of such programs.
In their letters, the regions told the senators about the problems of SME development and sent proposals to improve the current legislation.
“To date, communication between the regions is insufficiently established, as a result of which the business community in all regions of the visit by senators was marked by the question of the lack of information on regional programs for the development of entrepreneurship in the whole country,” said Andrey Kutepov.
In the annex to the letter, which was sent to the Government, he presented a set of positive developments of the regions on the legalization of self-employment and consolidated data from the regions with proposals and issues (available to the editorial office).
In addition to the relevant ministries, consolidated data from the regions are also sent to the heads of regional executive authorities.
The exchange of information on positive developments in the regions could give impetus to the development of entrepreneurship as a whole.
The first step to such an exchange will be to send the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy,” the senator told the “Parliamentary newspaper”.
Useful experience
Today, in many regions of the country, support programs for small and medium-sized businesses have been adopted and are successfully operating.
For example, in the Vologda region, there is an Entrepreneurship Support Center, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in conducting certification of finished products.
In the Ivanovo region, a business support system has been developed, providing for the implementation of the principle of one window through multifunctional centers.
In the Krasnodar Territory, start-up agricultural consumer cooperatives are provided with grants at the expense of the regional budget.
In the Oryol region there is a cluster development center.
The Amur region, within the framework of the federal project "Acceleration of small and medium-sized enterprises", provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators created on the basis of existing non-state coworking centers at the expense of the federal budget.
And in a number of other regions, special support measures are being taken for youth entrepreneurship.
The self-employed continue to pull out of the shadows
According to the regional authorities, a number of changes in the current legislation should be made to better support small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, the Arkhangelsk region proposed to replace the term "self-employment" with "entrepreneurship", since this "is most consistent with the content of the state service to promote the self-employment of unemployed citizens."
In the Ivanovo region, it is considered necessary to amend the list of activities performed by self-employed citizens, including activities for finishing and repairing residential premises, country houses, and conducting physical training classes.
The Bryansk region considers it important to strengthen control over unscrupulous dairy producers with the help of the veterinary system "Mercury".
And in Kostroma and Magadan regions advocate for the consolidation of the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and directions of support for social entrepreneurship in the regulatory and legal field.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.
"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills," Andrey Kutepov assured.

Internet users who use the services of the airline were delighted with the innovation.
Some of them thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.

According to the report sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the first half of 2019, 31 thousand tons of products were imported from the sanction countries against 3 million 442.2 thousand tons for the same period of 2013, Interfax reports.
At the same time, the cost of imported products decreased to $226.5 million from $4 billion, 975.5 million, respectively.
We are talking about the supply of goods that did not fall under the embargo.
As indicated in the report, the fallen volumes of prohibited products were compensated by increasing imports from the CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia, and Serbia.
Recall that at the end of August, the government extended until December 31, 2020 the validity of the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited for import to Russia under counter-sanctions.
In the document posted on the official portal of legal information, it was noted that the validity of the rules has been extended for another year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
Initially, the decree on the abolition of the sanctions applied to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, from August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein joined this list, from January 1, 2016 - Ukraine.
The decree signed by Putin on the destruction of illegally imported into the country “sanctions” (products that fell under the food embargo, which Moscow imposed in response to the anti-Russian sanctions of the West) entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the government allowed the destruction of “sanctioned” food in any legal way.
As Western sanctions are maintained, Russia has also extended its retaliatory measures.
At the same time, this measure does not apply to products that citizens import for personal use.
The ban does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Council under the President of the Russian Federation for the development of civil society and human rights, Mikhail Fedotov, previously called the destruction of food products "simply immoral", and this, according to him, negatively affects the education of people.
Moreover, Rospotrebnadzor took the initiative to ban the destruction of edible food in early June.
After that, a similar recommendation to the government was made by the Human Rights Council under the President of the Russian Federation.
And Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Gordeev said that it is wrong to destroy food products, and you need to think about how you can use them for their intended purpose, assessing the quality.

In Chile began to build a telescope worth 1 billion euros
This is reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
The construction of the dome of the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project so far, has officially started this week.
Its total cost, according to ESO estimates, will exceed one billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on the manufacture of equipment and the construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-sized mirror, whose diameter will be about 39 meters.
It will be assembled from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 meters.
This huge mirror, as well as two auxiliary reflecting surfaces with a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, will help E-ELT to get the first detailed photos of planets outside the Solar system, stars in other galaxies, as well as search for Earth’s counterparts.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the surroundings of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that the construction of the dome has only just begun, mirrors, scientific instruments and other components of the observatory scientists, engineers and other specialists have been developing for three years - since the announcement of the first plans for the construction of the E-ELT.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose total value amounted to about 400 million euros, was awarded to the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
