Twenty-eight-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco store
The twenty-eight-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was on the steps of a local grocery store this week.
But the victim’s brother says he has no idea who is trying to hurt him, adding, “He’s finally starting to get better.”
The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as an 82-year-old resident of San Francisco, Frank Galicia, the medical examiner's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said it was a violent death and an investigation was under way.
The brother of the victim, Louis Galicia, told ABC’s KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to be a private chef in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at Sons & Daughters six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were “shocked and devastated” by his death.
"We have a small team that works as a close-knit family, and we will miss them very much," the spokesman said.
At this difficult time, our thoughts and grief go out to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in hostels, but recently "had finally started to do well."
"He found an apartment, went out with a girl," Louis Galicia told the KGO.
Louis Galicia said he had no idea who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to connect with his family, he always cooked us food, made us dinner,” said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to get into a fight.
It was a brother who took things as they were.
“Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was an uncut diamond that he lit up every day,” he said.

Czech Railways has invested more than 31 billion in the modernization of vehicles.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
Over the past six years, the state carrier has invested over CZK 31 billion in the modernization of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, the amounts for modernisation in individual years, with the exception of 2012, are gradually decreasing.
Over the past six years, Czech Railways has invested over CZK 31 billion in the modernization of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent was reflected in a reduction in the average age of two years for locomotives and separate units and six years for classic wagons.
The carrier invested more in regional transport, where about 60 percent of the money was spent, and 40 percent was invested in the renewal of vehicles for long-distance transport.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years.
However, modernized older vehicles are counted as completely new in this indicator.
If vehicle upgrades were not counted, the average age of <0xC4><0x8C>D’s powertrains would increase by ten years.
Slightly older are on average passenger cars, whose average age, when including upgrades, is 23 years.
If only the age from the date of manufacture were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
However, in recent years, classic trains consisting of wagons and pulled by a locomotive have gradually disappeared from the Czech and world railways and have been replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the number of locomotives decreased from 280 to 223 and the number of classic cars decreased from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
In particular, the carrier disposed of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during the journey.
From January to July, the carrier ordered 110 of these vehicles to be scrapped.
From the investments that <0xC4><0x8C>D plans to make in the near future, it is possible to mention, for example, the purchase of 50 wagons for a speed of up to 200 kilometers per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for domestic high-speed lines.
The contract provides for the collection of up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electric units.
The authorities have known for a quarter of a year about illegal advertising, they can not get rid of it.
We are helpless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year, the editorial office of the online daily Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has been following the story of a billboard in South Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipno, where not only is a touristy interesting walk in the crowns of trees, but also an Olympic park.
Highway officials know it's black, but they say there's nothing they can do about it.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of similar ads all over the country.
According to officials, the law is flawed, because of which it is not possible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
First of all, a complicated bureaucratic wheel is needed.
In the meantime, however, the company changes its name and the office is short on it.
Or you just need to move the ad a few meters and the official process must start again.
A quarter of a year ago, the Directorate of Roads and Motorways admitted: at the main route from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice to Lipno, an advertising billboard stands black on our land by the state road.
But even three months were not enough for the officials to get rid of the unauthorized portable design with a giant advertising poster.
As if no one cared that he was standing right next to the road, in a 50-meter protective zone, where nothing could stand for safety reasons.
Road managers say they simply can’t handle the billboard because of the leaky law.
Maybe load it up and take it away.
“We can’t afford that,” said Nina Ledvina, a spokeswoman for Highways and Highways, referring to the complex bureaucratic wheel that the removal of the billboard must legally prevent.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate the online daily Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz began to follow in detail in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and the authorities cannot effectively and quickly solve.
In South Bohemia alone, the editorial office counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed against the rules right next to or in the vicinity of the road.
Similarly, there are other regions.
"We have a problem to force the company to remove the binders," confirms Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Klása, head of the transport department of the <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice regional office, whose colleagues deal with similar stories.
According to Klása, it is the fault of a leaky law that binds officials.
First of all, he has to address the owner of the billboard in order to put the advertisement away.
But CEOs are often unattainable, or they know a trick that Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has already described in the past, when the issue began to take a more detailed interest: it is enough to move the mobile stand with advertising a few meters, and officials can throw the previous call to remove black advertising in the trash.
This is because the authority must determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly do not agree, they see it as a new device and we have to address the owner again," explains Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Klása.
The new law will not help.
The amendment could be introduced by a new law, which will ban billboards on motorways from September next year and restrict them also on I. class roads.
Critics point out that the rules for combating illegal and easily transferable ads will remain the same as before.
And the authorities will not be so relieved.
Companies can thus continue to earn tens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year on leases of illegal areas, and no one can afford them.
For example, the billboard attracting to Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know it well: the <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice City Hall is currently running three administrative proceedings for black-built billboards.
The company faces a fine of three hundred thousand euros in each case.
These are more ads that were placed without permission in the protective zone of the first class road.
The proceedings have not yet been concluded, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the transport department of the <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice municipality.
The ad, which Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz is interested in, is not yet among these cases, but will most likely be added to them soon.
According to <0xC5><0x98>SD spokesperson Nina Ledvinová, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case will be brought to the table of regional and then probably magistrate officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that can’t be contacted.
It does not take over the post office and the official headquarters in <0xC5><0xBD>i<0xC5><0xBE>kov was abolished more than six years ago.
It is not clear who is behind it.
In the past, the company’s mail went to the South Bohemian businessman Anton Fischer, who was famous for a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech representative office of the Hyundai brand.
Fischer, whose Euro Billboard company leases the Comerz Billboard space and offers it to advertisers, has previously denied any connection.
However, this spring, when <0xC5><0x98>SD began to be interested in advertising Lipno at the initiative of Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, Fischer had state officials send a letter to the mysterious Commerz Billboard company to his guest house, where the company is supposedly now based.
To this day, no one has been able to contact the highway authorities.
A futile struggle.
Similar silences or opaque changes of residences are not uncommon.
A few years ago, we gradually fined one company two million crowns.
But she changed her name and ICO and there was nothing to deal with.
The executor returned the case, the ads were still standing, maybe in other places.
We are quite powerless against such companies and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, admitted on condition of anonymity one of the officials.
The amendment to the law has not yet been implemented in this regard.
He spoke to several members of parliament who were concerned about the issue.
So far, they have not taken any action.
On the contrary, there were MPs who wanted to extend the deadline for the preservation of billboards on the main Czech roads.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are not only a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic for national, but also regional and municipal policies.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their restrictions, on the other hand, they themselves need them for advertising in election campaigns.
I don’t hold the fairly well-established impression that when something doesn’t work, the laws need to be changed.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more rapeseed and poppy, according to statistics.
According to the estimates of the Czech Statistical Office, this year's cereal harvest will be 6.7 percent lower than last year.
However, this year’s crop exceeds the average for the last five or ten years.
On the other hand, rapeseed (by 3.9 percent) and poppy (2.5 percent) harvests will be higher.
The grain harvest this year will be 6.7 percent lower than last year.
Farmers will harvest 7.2 million tonnes of grain.
This follows from an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office as of 15 July.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic, predicting a tenth of last year's decline.
But last year's cereal harvest was above average.
This year’s crop exceeds the average for the last five or ten years.
On the contrary, the harvest of rapeseed and poppy will be higher this year.
Rapeseed growers harvest 3.9 percent more than a year ago, when they received 1,256 million tons under the roof.
This year’s poppy crop could be 2.5 percent higher than last year’s.
The projected decrease in cereal production is due to both a decrease in the hectare yield by 3.7 percent to 5.71 tonnes per hectare and a decrease in the crop area.
This year, farmers planted three percent fewer fields.
Winter wheat, which is the most important grain for the Czech Republic, is estimated to be harvested 3.3 percent less this year.
Farmers are evicting her from several fields.
However, a lower hectare yield will be signed on the decline, which will fall to 6.04 tons.
A roughly one-fifth decrease is expected for spring barley, which is most commonly used for beer production.
The reduction in crop yields is due to a 15.2 per cent reduction in acreage, as well as a lower yield per hectare.
In contrast, winter barley yields 6.3 percent more.
The harvest of grain will also increase.
The harvest of rapeseed is estimated at 1.305 million tons, which is more than last year.
The crop area has increased by 7.3 percent.
Hectare yield will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year’s rapeseed crop exceeds the 10-year average by 13.3%, while it is sown on an area one third larger than ten years ago.
There has also been an increase in poppy fields in the last four years.
This year, the farmers evicted him on 35,543 hectares.
Compared to 2008, when poppy was grown in the Czech Republic on a record 70,000 hectares, the field is half.
Thanks to the expansion of crop areas, this year's poppy harvest will be richer.
It will rise by 2.5 percent to 27,423 tonnes last year.
Hectare yield will be 6.1% lower.
Olomouc police charged two men with assault with a knife and machete, the court sent them into custody.
Police have charged two attackers who attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and machete in the centre of Olomouc on Tuesday.
"Although the victim was trying to escape, they inflicted a cutting and cutting injury, which required hospital treatment and other treatment," police spokeswoman Marie <0xC5><0xA0>trbáková said.
The two suspects were arrested by police immediately after the attack.
The prosecutor filed a motion to take them into custody and the court granted it on Friday.
Both men face between three and 10 years in prison.
Police have charged two detainees with assaulting a 35-year-old man in the centre of Olomouc with a knife and machete.
The assailants inflicted cuts and cuts, and the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people that took place on Tuesday at noon in Svoboda class, police said.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, Olomouc police spokesman Marie <0xC5><0xA0>trbáková said.
A mass skirmish between the two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratoria bar in the immediate vicinity of the centre of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal argument, two attackers attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and machete.
Although the man was trying to escape, they inflicted a cut and slash wound that required hospital treatment and other treatment, a police spokesman said.
During the skirmish, which aroused great attention in the city center and due to which several police patrols and officers had to intervene on the spot, there were family disputes.
Criminals accused a thirty-four-year-old man from Slovakia and a thirty-seven-year-old man from Olomouc of attempting serious bodily harm and disorderly conduct.
The prosecutor filed a motion with the court to take them into custody and the court granted it on Friday, the spokesman added.
The machete was used in the centre of Olomouc during a mass battle by the attackers five years ago, it happened only a few tens of meters away, in front of the discotheque Varna in Riegrova street.
Police said at the time that a group of about ten foreigners with guns attacked the guests of the business, who were standing in front of the entrance.
According to the police, they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then sentenced the two assailants to a suspended sentence.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You’ll be surprised if you walk around them every day.
One of the most striking examples of an unused and empty house is the large building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of Senová<0xC5><0xBE>né nám<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD>.
It should have been a hotel a long time ago.
But still nothing.
That it is necessary to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what about using the existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Directly in the center of Prague, in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square, there are several apartment buildings that, despite their location, size and often even the monument protection, are empty and empty.
We selected the properties in the center with the help of the project Prázdnédomy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
Homes are usually the victims of financial problems of their owners, opaque relationships between companies, or belonging to a state that cannot or does not want to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
Let the owners pay a special tax for them, the initiative wants

Clinton’s husbands made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to release his tax return.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
More than $1 million was donated to Clinton’s charity.
Most of the Clintons’ income — over $6 million — is for their speeches.
Trump refuses to release his tax return.
U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her tax returns on Friday, increasing pressure on her Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, earned $10.6 million last year, the AP reported.
Most of Clinton’s income — over $6 million — is in favor of their speeches, mostly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton began her campaign before the election.
The tax report showed that the Clintons paid a federal income tax of 34.2% last year, followed by a state and local income tax of 9%.
In total, they paid 43.2% of their income in taxes.
Trump, however, has a problem with such a move, so far he has not decided to publish the tax return.
There’s a possibility that Donald Trump doesn’t pay any taxes at all, Clinton tweeted just minutes after her confession was made public.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to the secrecy surrounding Trump’s earnings, among other things, to cast doubt on whether her rival is really as wealthy as she claims.
Trump’s net worth is estimated at billions of dollars.
A lower salary would damage the Republican candidate’s reputation as a successful businessman.

In Nigeria, polio has re-emerged.
Islamists in Boko Haram prevented consistent vaccinations and killed the doctor.
Cases of polio have resurfaced in Nigeria.
In the northeast of the country, the government declared an emergency vaccination, as two children infected with the disease became paralyzed.
Vaccines brought helicopters there.
Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram were active in the affected area, who prevented vaccinations and even killed doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus has been circulating there undetected.
In northeastern Nigeria, emergency polio vaccinations will begin as two children infected with the disease have become paralyzed.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that one million children will be vaccinated in Borno state and another four million in the surrounding states.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday quickly transported polio vaccines to the affected northeastern part of the country, where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram operate.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus had been circulating in the area undetected for many years.
Boko Haram extremists have in the past prevented vaccinations and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also made it impossible for doctors to reach areas where children with polio were found on Thursday.
Both affected toddlers came with refugees from a part of Nigeria newly liberated from Boko Haram.
The head of the WHO’s polio eradication unit, Michel Zaffran, told the BBC that vaccinations in Nigeria would start as early as next week.
The Islamic radical group Boko Haram has long been active in the state of Borno.
The area was made available to international organizations and the government only at the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram managed to weaken significantly in this part of the country.
Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adewole admitted that the new polio cases are a big disappointment for the country because Nigeria wanted to announce next year that polio had been eradicated.
The WHO said it was possible that although the disease had not appeared for two years, it had spread among children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all polio cases in the world.
While polio was still present in 125 countries in 1988, it is still present in only three regions: Afghanistan and Pakistan, and northern Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the stories of the fallen women.
Pope Francis met with 20 former prostitutes who escaped from a gang of pimps thanks to the police.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and urged them to look to the future with confidence.
With this meeting, Francis wanted to draw attention to trafficking in human beings and to call for an intensification of the fight against it.
In Rome, Pope Francis met 20 former prostitutes who had been freed by police from the power of a gang of pimps.
The head of the Catholic Church listened for more than an hour to the moving stories of fallen women and then urged them to look to the future with confidence, a Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes Francis visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one each from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All were subjected to brutal physical violence during forced prostitution, according to the Vatican.
The visit was intended to draw attention to human trafficking and call for an intensified fight against it, the pope’s spokesman said.
Francis often draws attention to the fate of people on the fringes of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican this April and June thanks to his personal invitation.
France is going to hit the jihadists' factories.
Without the help of Muslims, this is not possible.
France should be helped by Muslims themselves in the fight against radical Islamism.
In addition, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Valls is preparing major changes in the functioning of mosques and the education of clerics.
Since last December, we have closed 20 mosques and a prayer hall.
And others will follow, the interior minister announced.
There are over 100 jihadi factories in the country.
“If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee that freedom,” Valls said.
In particular, it intends to ensure that only imams who were educated in France preach in mosques and prayer rooms.
At the same time, he wants to stop funding mosques from abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money is coming from abroad to build new mosques, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
This is also why preachers who can sow radicalism in France get into mosques.
“Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy,” he said.
The key to achieving these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should act as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more money from abroad.
The French Foundation for Islam was founded in 2005 by then-Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Even then, the foundation was supposed to contribute to the transparency of financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But the institution was soon struck by internal contradictions and rivalries.
"It's a total failure," Valls said recently.
After the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, a debate broke out on the French political scene over a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation.
All this was precipitated by further terrorist attacks in France, carried out in the name of the Islamic State by radicalized Islamists.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently made it clear that a new foundation will be created this October.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also to supervise imams.
It is not yet clear where he will take the money not only for the construction of new mosques, but also for various educational centers.
However, several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or tax on halal food.
Here, in practice, halal food vendors would pay to provide certification.
Some of that money would then go to the foundation's cash register.
The contribution of 10 to 20 euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
About 30,000 people go there each year on a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
And not only that.
According to the prime minister, in the future, only preachers who have undergone special educational programs at French universities should work in mosques.
This should ensure that preaching is consistent with democracy.
We'll close the radical mosques.
At the same time, the French government is on a campaign against radicals.
And others will follow, the interior minister announced recently.
In France, there is no place for those who preach hatred in mosques and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
There are an estimated 2,500 mosques and prayer houses in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, authorities have expelled about 80 imams and are considering doing so for several dozen others.
But not everyone thinks that the government’s actions can significantly intervene against radicalism.
Those who want to be radicalized will do the same.
This is not happening in mosques, young people are radicalizing on the Internet, said Severine Labatová, an expert from the National Center for Scientific Research.
Dráha<0xC5><0x99> Kelemen lost in the first round of the sprint with the star Baugém.
To advance to the semifinals, the Czech track cyclist has to fight in repair runs.
The track cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro after progressing from qualifying sprint among the best eighteen lost in the 1st round duel with the French giant Grégory Baugé, a defender of silver from the previous games in London.
He has to fight for promotion to the semi-finals in repair runs.
At the start of the royal discipline on the track stood 27 riders and the best Czech trackman today took the fourteenth best time.
Two hundred with a quick start arrived in 9.969 seconds.
In the main knockout stage, he was waiting for the fifth Baugé in qualifying, who already has a team sprint bronze from Rio.
In the end, Kelemen pressured an experienced Frenchman, but he watched the process.
The great performance was brilliant gold defender Jason Kenny.
The 28-year-old took the third fastest 200 in history and won the qualifier in an Olympic record of 9,551.
As expected, he also easily coped with the last advancing German, Maximilian Levy.
It was also a success for the British quartet with Bradley Wiggins, who set a new world record of 3:50,570 in the 4 km pursuit race and advanced to the finals.
The current maximum (3:51,659), which was four years after the London Olympics, was improved by more than a second.
Young doctors push: They want fresh wind in the industry
Representatives of young doctors gathered to approve new steps in their dispute over a new contract.
The Council of Young Doctors (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) must ask the whole council to support other industry events from early September.
JDC says the ministers have not been able to resolve the treaty issues.
In July, young doctors and medical students voted to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.
58% of its members who participated in the election were rejected.
In a letter to members published on Thursday night on Twitter, JDC Chair Ellen McCourt said the government remained "still silent" on the issues, which led to the contract being rejected.
She said: “In this light, the JDC executive body voted to reject the proposed new treaty altogether and to request new formal negotiations on all issues.”
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC’s executive board formally requested a special meeting of the BMA board to approve the ongoing program of enhanced industry events from early September.
The dispute has led young doctors to declare up to six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the NHS.
The leader of young doctors at the BMA, Dr. Johann Malawina, resigned after the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members at pre-voting meetings in front of 54,000 young doctors and medical students that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the health minister said the treaty would put a strain on doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: An alliance of “incompatible”?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce a formal end to an eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart in the sumptuous hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I had the impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin didn’t smile and barely radiated warmth, even by his measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly spoken of his “dear friend” Mr Putin – five times, according to one report.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis level, but would be even better.
The next day, a local newspaper reported that Erdogan had acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm revealed the exact opposite.
But the persistent cold that radiated from Putin has shown that the Russian leader has forgotten nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: the downing of a Russian warplane by Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction was furious.
Putin dealt blows around him and accused Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The scandal was all the greater because it came from an alleged friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
The state-controlled media has been waging a massive nationwide campaign against Ankara for months.
Suddenly, it seemed as if the Turks were responsible for everything.
More serious were allegations from top state officials that Erdogan’s own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He emphatically denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message came that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared some kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
First of all, Erdogan was almost stripped of power last month during a failed coup and therefore needs all his friends.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also visibly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia’s sanctions have had a severe impact – notably the cancellation of charter flights that carry several million Russian tourists to Turkey’s coast each year.
This number has decreased by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly rest here when flights are resumed.
They make money on Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state TV promised cheaper fruit and vegetables when Turkish imports of agricultural commodities are allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as the Vedemasti newspaper reported.
The visit, however, had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it sees as a weak response to the coup attempt.
In addition, the long-lasting hostility of lengthy talks about joining the EU and the entry of Putin - who is eager to take advantage of the cooling and break Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly earned bonus points when Ankara asked him for help from the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
You must understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-rooted fear of regime change, this is the case.
So the summit in this pompous, seaside palace of Russia and Turkey allowed me to demonstrate what one of the analysts described to me as an “alliance of the irreconcilables”: how the forces of two countries that feel rejected and exploited by the West are united.
However, despite the fact that they have publicly shown mutual reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow has recently taken on the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey are on opposite sides.
One could say that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents said at a press conference that they had not even mentioned this issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about the differences between them, while Putin decided to highlight these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which the two countries can find a common language on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility — and given the risk of total disaster when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian warplane — it is certainly better that the two leaders at least talk again.
Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for non-Scotland customers
According to the bank’s executive director, the RBS brand is to be relegated to the role of back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
It had faded from them when, eight years ago, it had almost disappeared and had to be redeemed from its debt.
At the time, strategic brands used “RBS” to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was backed by millions of pounds spent sponsoring international sports, from the Six Nations Rugby Championship to Winbledom champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been decided that it is better to give more prominence to national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but will not launch new stores.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of the head office and share coding on the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
For customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the Ulster Bank brand is already used.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will come more to the fore – Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt’s Military Bank.
During trips to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered questions from Ross McEwan.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will cease to be our investment brand and the brand for which our employees work because we are now much more a bank of brands.”
Since the bank has become a global brand itself, it has become a global brand as well as RBS.
Now I say that we no longer have a global aspiration, we have efforts focused on the domestic scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities, and our employees will work under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations championship, has prepared a profile of individual sports sponsoring brands.
“It’s a good time for us to move to a brand bank, because the fundamental question (we ask) is, how do we focus on becoming a better bank for customers?” the CEO said.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical to say that we were going to be a great customer bank and introduce those brands.
But as we focus on customer needs rather than our own, I think there are a lot of changes going on.
We can remind these brands again, I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on horseback Predilection led to the goal of the 3000th winner
Dettori splashes champagne after double win at Newmarket brings him 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th victory in the UK at Newmarket on Friday.
He achieved this milestone with his second victory of the evening on his local track - on the horse Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in a straight race.
Its predecessors were Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time checker champion Dettori, who had previously won on the Ghayyar horse, said, “It’s strange.”
I'm very touched because my family is here too.
I am extremely glad that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I anchored 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on the ground with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when he brings Predilection after victory
Two jockeys have reached this milestone in obstacle races – Jockey Champion Richard Johnson and 20-times retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who during his record-breaking career has led to the goal of more than 4,300 winners.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and it is no surprise that he has reached a milestone that only a few riders have reached before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical fistron that distinguishes him from other riders in the race.
He is a fantastic racing ambassador, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for many years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he wasn’t only riding on weekends and big races, he’d already have 6,000 winners!
But the truth is, Frankie has been riding the winner in the UK for most of his 30-year career, and that’s really something.
He has a lively nature, which is good for British racing, but more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous quick jump
From fly-by-wire finishes to fly-by-night jumps, Frankie Dettori has been a messenger of British flat racing for two decades.
It was like riding a roller coaster.
Innumerable number of winners of the big races, including his famous "magnificent seven" in Ascot. But he also survived the plane crash and was banned from taking off because of drugs.
Three years ago, he first stagnated when he returned after a six-month start ban, but he showed incredible inner strength and returned to his best form despite all the doubters.
And maybe it won’t be the last time – Dettori has said before that he would like to continue racing until at least 50 years.
Russian President Vladimir Putin fired the head of the presidential office Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday unexpectedly dismissed Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the presidential office.
Ivanov was one of Putin’s closest collaborators for many years.
Thirty-six-year-old Ivanov was appointed special representative for ecology and transport.
The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin had “released Ivanov from his service as head of the Russian presidential office,” but did not give a reason.
He will be replaced by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012.
The 44-year-old was previously a diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
The website (in Russian) states that he later served as the head of the presidential protocol and presidential office.
He told Putin: “Thank you for your trust.”
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities of the head of state in terms of draft laws and control over the extent to which your instructions are followed.
Putin told a Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked for his release from the post and recommended that Vaino replace him.
Convince the smiles?
This move completely mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of the closest associates of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin, broadcast on state television, the two men announced that they were leaving the post of head of the presidential office at their own request.
But the smiles on the cameras have convinced only a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this a result of a power struggle?
Nobody knows that yet.
But the official claim that the man once thought of as a possible president is suddenly eager to lead Russia’s environmental policy has been met with great mistrust.
The Kremlin website quotes comments addressed to Putin, in which Ivanov states: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you in an interview to entrust me with this very demanding post, even a problematic one, for four years.
Apparently, I was chief of staff for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
In the late 1990s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin took power, he appointed Ivanov as one of his five closest associates.
At one time, it was even speculated that Ivanov might succeed Putin as head of state after his second term, as a third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
But this post was taken over by another close Putin collaborator, Dmitry Medvedev.
Just three and a half years later, Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency.
Thomas Gibson, star of ‘Criminal Minds’, was fired after hitting director
Gibson got involved in a physical exchange on stage in Los Angeles last month.
ABC and CBS, which produce the series, announced its release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before announcing his firing.
There were creative differences in the scene and disagreements.
I am sorry that this has happened," he said in a statement.
According to ABC and CBS, the details of how Gibson's character will disappear from the series, which follows the stories of the FBI's team of agents, will be revealed at a later date.
The 54-year-old actor, best known for starring in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has been starring in the series since its first season in 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds, and I’ve put my heart and soul into them for the past 12 years,” Gibson said in a statement.
I was hoping to be in it until the end, but that won't be possible now.
I would also like to express my gratitude to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team and, above all, the great fans that this show could ever hope for.
The series is expected to return to its 12th season on September 28.
In the town of Banff, fish mysteriously landed in the garden
A man from Banff asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish may be sand eels left there by a water storm.
Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a short film of his discovery on the Periscope channel, in the belief that someone could help him clarify how about 5cm of fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connects with Fife
<0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project to be completed by May 2017
Engineers connected the northern platform and Queensferry Crossing and the viaduct - the bridge now connects with Fife.
This is the first of four closures between the “platform fans” that are now almost complete around each of the three bridge pylons.
Part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 ropes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment in the building of Queensferry Crossing.
In this project, we have all witnessed how civil engineers, on an impressive scale, used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge platform was a delicate operation that required extraordinary precision.
In total, more than 79% of the total area of the bridge is now in place, the concrete for the last parts of the platform is now cast in Rosyth, so the entire platform is ready to be lifted to the bridge.
Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project manager, said: “The first closure for any bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this cap represents the pinnacle of building construction.
After installing the last part of the road platform and connecting it to the North Tower expansion platform, we had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by stretching the northern approach viaduct 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled with an ascent of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances with which the team worked were very small - only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Moelfre Bay rescue: Three men 'happy to be alive'
The three men are “happy to be alive” after being washed away by the water from their fishing boat at Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station sounded the alarm on Friday at 13:20 UK daylight saving time after the crew saw the incident in Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim to safety while their boat continued uncontrollably.
"We saw their boat circling near them, and we thought of the worst," Moelfre's pilot Vince Jones said.
"Fortunately, a strong wind drove him away from them before we left," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and a third man, aged 60, was found without a life jacket exhausted as he held on to the buoys.
They were all taken aboard the coastal lifeboat and taken back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said: “The three men thrown into the water are happy to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had an emergency power-off rope, but somehow it was disconnected from the person who was driving the boat when it overturned.
Someone was holding a protective hand over the boys from above.
The judge refuses to solve the case because of Tlucho<0xC5><0x99>'s wife.
Petr Tlucho<0xC5><0x99> is one of three MPs charged with receiving political traffic from Prime Minister Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as and his then chief of staff Jana Nagy, a lucrative post for a political concession.
In 2012, the tax package was approved.
Schneider, Fuksa and Tlucho<0xC5><0x99> enabled him with their resignations.
Then they appeared in influential positions in state-owned companies.
That is why they also faced suspicion of bribery and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, unjustifiably, and thus received compensation of a total of almost 2 million crowns.
The case is now being heard as a witness, following the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a courthouse on the Fruit Market and settles civil disputes.
Despite this, Judge Helena Králová wants to be cautious and avoid possible objections.
The case is likely to be handled by another Prague court district.
The Queen has already acquitted Jana Ne<0xC4><0x8D>asová, formerly Nagy, twice.
It was an alleged use of military intelligence to spy on Prime Minister Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as Radka's first wife.
In this case, Tlusho<0xC5><0x99> did not figure.
According to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, however, this is an unnecessarily excessive reaction.
I do not think that impartiality can be interpreted in such a way as to exclude a court if the witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid there's nothing to judge, he told the newspaper.
"I find it fleeting," he added.
Roman Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ek, a former official, is also charged in the case of political traffic.
According to his lawyer, Petr Toman, however, a possible objection would have a chance of success.
On 13 June, the District Court for Prague 1 heard the indictment of the former chief of staff of Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, Jana Nagyová (now Ne<0xC4><0x8D>asová), and others accused of abusing the Military Intelligence.
In the picture, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>asová and her husband come to court.
Tlucho<0xC5><0x99>ová was supposed to deal with statements about Peroutek.
The envoy’s wife, for example, was supposed to judge President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman’s statements about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutek.
Zeman said he sympathized with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl was killed in an Allied air raid.
She and two of her friends flew to Syria last February from London’s Gatwick airport.
The Home Office did not comment on the report of her death.
Young London women who fled their homes have been smuggled into Syria across the Turkish border, police say.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana are reported to have followed their former classmate from London’s Bethnal Green Academy.
Last year’s incident sparked a huge wave of attention and also tension in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security officials estimate that some 600 British Muslims have travelled to Syria so far, including about 50 young women and girls.
A number of them joined the radicals from ISIS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
A dream job for a hundred thousand dollars.
A well-paid job that you don’t even need a college degree for.
This is what it looks like at first glance the work of an IT professional.
And often the other.
The advantage is not only extremely high salary (in Prague you can earn up to 180,000 CZK by working in IT), but also extreme benefits.
This is due to a shortage of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
It is estimated that almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
According to the Grafton recruitment agency, the most sought after are programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
Therefore, candidates do not compete for a job position, but for a job position for candidates, comments Jitka Sou<0xC4><0x8D>ková, marketing manager at Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a necessity.
Higher education is not necessary for students.
Higher education means a good foundation and is an overall indicator of a candidate’s intelligence and educational ability, but it often has little to do with knowledge of development.
Developers must constantly learn new things, which will not be replaced by a university, says Petr Kuba<0xC4><0x8D>ka, director of Monster Career CZ.
The most money is made in Prague.
The salaries of IT workers are far above the national average.
Most of the money will come from Prague and Brno, in the regions it is no longer such a hit parade.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," Kuba<0xC4><0x8D>ka confirms.
The highest earnings will be achieved by technical directors.
In Prague and Brno they can come for 120 000 - 180 000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but even there it will not fall below CZK 80,000.
IT project managers are also in demand.
Upon entry, they can earn 60 000 - 100 000 CZK.
There's also the issue of graduates.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the labor office, this is not the case with IT professionals.
If companies drag themselves and overpay an expert from another company, they are happy to reach for a graduate.
They can raise him on their own.
They cannot do without language.
Knowledge of a foreign language is useful in any profession, but at least decent English is necessary for IT professionals.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a must for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we are faced with a number of cases where companies are looking especially for a professionally educated and experienced person and are satisfied only with an average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, a support worker speaks more than one foreign language, he is interesting to his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, adds Director Kuba<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
Oh, Google, there's paradise.
Czech workers can only be jealous of Google employees.
Of course, for them, flexible working hours, the possibility of working from home or various shortened hours, not only for mothers, are a matter of course.
“The company gives new dads four weeks of extra leave after the baby is born,” said Martina Joneková, a Google spokeswoman.
Nursing also includes health care for employees and family, meals, transport, training, wellness or massages directly at the workplace.
Anyone who wants to learn has a green light, and it doesn’t matter what new things they want to learn.
But the benefits do not end there.
Such a full refrigerator for free is also definitely not to be thrown away.
A healthy lunch (in some locations also breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called micro-kitchens in all offices, where people always find a healthy snack, the spokesman said.
And so that nothing has to be thrown away, what is not eaten is put in boxes that employees can take home at night.
And the reason for these Czech ratios of incredible benefits?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
“For Google, it’s not about employees sitting in the office for eight hours a day, it’s about the results of initiatives or projects, shifts or developments, ideas and innovative solutions.”
The United Nations has strongly criticized Bulgaria for criminalising refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the UN's human rights commissioner, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalising refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "raises serious concerns about Bulgaria's failure to comply with international law," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in a statement.
“It is particularly disturbing to witness how important and influential public figures are publicly expressing support for criminal armed militias that are brazenly pursuing refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey,” he said.
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross into Bulgarian territory irregularly are automatically arrested," Zeid said.
Worse still, they are often prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or more - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria detained 14,000 migrants this year, up from 21,000 last year.
Pokémon Go - the pursuit of health and happiness that pays off
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
Many people have lamented over the past decade that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer to spend their free time in front of screens.
Pokémon Go picks people up from couches and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of screens was initially reduced to television, later to video games and most recently to smartphones.
It’s great to see that technology and outdoor activities aren’t mutually exclusive.
Of course, I’m talking about fashion, which is Pokémon Go, an app based on characters that first appeared in video games in the late 90s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest before the launch of this new game at the beginning of July in the US, Australia and New Zealand.
The release in other countries was then delayed due to massive interest that led to server overload.
In just a few days, Pokémon Go gained more users than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players on a smartphone go out to look for Pokémon that they track using GPS, and when they find them, they can “take a picture” (via a screenshot on the phone) or “catch” them.
Mania captures the younger generation playing the game, picks them up from their seats and leads them out in search of Pokémon.
In the US, this game has seen a significant increase in the number of steps that the “average” person takes every day.
Apple’s smartwatch app Cardiogram, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told The Washington Post that within two days of the game’s launch, the number of people who exercised every day for 30 minutes jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees rough data on exercise levels.
Many public campaigns seeking to get people to “find 30,” “get off the couch,” and “be active every day” have fallen on infertile ground because most public health messages are boring and intended for people who don’t look good.
The importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we can’t fully list here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something that they enjoy.
You cover the three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunlight. And fun.
Some people even make new friends while hunting for Pokémon.
As it happens, of course, there are some boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can walk in the door.
What, like?
There's been a breakthrough.
In their day, smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity, but they didn’t give us a reason to do anything like this game.
The novelty will look around and interest in it will begin to decline at some point.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, other games will appear that will combine applications and virtual reality with real-world activity and help a number of people in the pursuit of activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles won gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic on the jump.
No hard work on the log.
They were all silent on the plains.
Excellent in everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast went straight for the title in the all-around on Thursday and overcame the rest in full line under the Olympic spotlights.
The overall result of 62,198 clearly confirmed her lead over silver medalist and member of the “final five” team Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafinova.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during a clarinet performance in the final of the individual all-around gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row to win the all-around, and the fifth overall, as she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best ever.
When her overall final score was on the board and her long journey up to this point was over, tears appeared on her face.
This success places her in the same league of unique athletes of her time as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
Bilesová has dominated the sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at world championships - including 10 golds. Her stunning line-ups are a mixture of ambition and precision, and 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast she's ever seen."
Her final test awaited her in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the competitors, but between herself and the burden of too much expectation.
Anything other than returning home to his family in Spring, Texas with a hand full of gold medals would be seen as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning the gold and silver medals in the women's singles final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
The first Biles won on Tuesday, when she was a exclamation point in a celebration of outgoing national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that she never looked forward during her long journey to the summit, which is not entirely true.
Part of her line-up in singles - the one that features her typical triple flip flip-flops - is set to Latin music that would just fit home, in the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and her talent was discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother on her way to the gym where Boorman trained and gained strength.
She hasn’t lost a multi-fight since the summer of 2013 – that’s a win streak that can go on for as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafin took the lead for a short time thanks to two turns, it was only an illusion.
A bet and a simple - where Biles defends the world championship - are waiting.
She got back to the lead with 15,433 points for the clad - and finished with 15,933 points in the freestyle.
Raisman hugged her gently as they waited for the final score - a mere formality - and around the gleaming red, white, and blue shadows, Biles burst into tears as the wish she had once written in her diary as a child came true.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared third place with Mustafinova, but then she was bronzed for the sum of the three best teams.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team that Americans call “Grandma” was well ahead.
After her simpletons, she sent air kisses to the crowd, overcome by a return that sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Biles, the post this 19-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where it became a complete hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial killer case shot dead while listening to music in car
According to a police report released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl died during the most important attack of the decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot while sitting in a car, talking and listening to music.
Authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 in a car parked in the driveway.
According to the report, the armed man stood on the passenger’s side and fired eight shots from a handgun, then fled in another vehicle.
According to police, the robbery was not responsible for the triple murder, because the attacker did not take the wallet, nor the amount of $ 2,900 that one of the adult victims had with him.
A Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said investigators were looking into whether the shooting had anything to do with any of the previous four attacks.
In two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods, there were a total of nine attacks in four months, killing seven people and injuring two others.
“It’s happening in the residential area in front of the houses,” Howard told CBS’s KPHO earlier this month.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators declined to say what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was taken to hospital, where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter, Maleah, died on the spot.
A witness told police it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report about the shooting, which targeted an empty van just half an hour before the three-time murder. Police believe that its origin was this serial killer.
Investigators found the cartridges and assembled a bullet from the remains of the bullets in the seat and from under the bonnet of the engine.
The mother of a six-year-old child with microcephaly: "His condition is improving"
Edmund Picciuto, like most children his age, loves singing, toys and, of course, also his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephaly, which is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, I was the first to think I couldn't handle this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
“That’s not true at all – of course you’re ready for that,” she said.
She and her husband Vincent learned that Edmund might never know them, and that he might not survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in an institution.
“My first reaction was that I thought people weren’t doing this anymore,” Picciut said.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
He couldn't sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
Some of the milestones are slowly being met.
He walks with help and rides a bike.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth gives a sign language in which Edmund says, "Please sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciut told CBS News.
But this is not ordinary sign language - he says that Edmund invented some of the characters himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic, as in the case of Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
The symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It is too early to say what impact the Zika virus will have on the lives of those infected.
Picciut is a reminder of the emotional tax an uncertain future is taking.
I keep asking, "What's next?"
What's next?
And she's still not sure.
In fact, I never asked what the overall prognosis was because I didn’t expect anyone to be able to tell me.
But Picciut has an encouraging message for mothers of all children who suffer from birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is improving.
Know that it will be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and flooding have prompted rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi.
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected on Saturday.
The National Weather Service (NWS) has reported that after extreme downpours, a number of rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi are overflowing their banks and threatening widespread flooding.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and assistance is already on its way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor’s national security and emergency preparedness office, said they were receiving requests for water vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said the Tangipaho district alone asked for 10,000 bags of sand.
Flood patrols will remain in most of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The Met Office said in a statement that there could be another 8 to 13 centimeters of rain over the sea.
In southern Alabama, a flood patrol was on standby Friday as the rains continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River at Baton Rouge and the Amite River at Denham Springs are forecast to climax over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said both said they could flood a number of homes in the Baton Rouge suburbs.
He went on to say that the danger was the upstream flooding in the Ascension district, where these watercourses would only flow slowly into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest recorded level on Friday at 9 a.m.
Rescue workers are still picking up people from the storm surge in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and step-son were among those rescued at Gloster earlier on Friday.
Hansford, 62, said the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 metres from his house, rose rapidly overnight.
He said he was alerted by his next stepson, who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was coming," Hansford said.
I had it up to my waist.
According to his wife, this is the highest level she has experienced on the river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all members of his family are disabled and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three huge military-style trucks and transported them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said as heavy rains continued, the floods were “spreading rapidly” and authorities were considering evacuations.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livinston reported that 35 centimeters of rain fell from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil has been heavily soaked since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and paid trips had prompted rescues from their homes in Tangipahoa district and the cancellation of classes in five school districts.
The WWL branch of CBS reported that, according to an elder from Tangipaho, 200 homes were flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
Mayor Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped in the high water.
Shelters have been set up in Amite and Hammond for those who have been evacuated.
"They'll be able to come home when the water starts to recede," he said.
In the district of Tangipahoa in the city of Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed due to flooding, and local residents were given sandbags that they could pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
"We had our last major flooding here in March," said Lacy Landrum, the town's administrator.
It seems that these floods will be similar.
Rupert Lacy, emergency manager for Harrison County, Mississippi, said it was continuing to rain on the Gulf coast.
He said several houses were reported flooded on Thursday, but none of them appeared in the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, Head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in several places I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "a boy shot like a bat", survived the shooting in Philadelphia
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot dead in Philadelphia, the second shooting this week of a six-year-old in the city.
The child's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
Grandparents say the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including a groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious during transport to the hospital.
"He caught too much, his little body was shot as it was dealt with," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family told the station that the boy should be cured.
He was to enter the first grade of elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is among four people who were shot in Germantown.
Three other men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the men, aged 29, is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, two more victims are in stable condition.
According to the station, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could have been the shooter.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there may have been a shootout between several armed men.
At the site were found cartridges from assault weapons belonging to various assault weapons.
It was clearly an ongoing battle.
There were shells on either side of the sidewalk.
So it seems that there were several armed combatants who were actively involved," Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No one has been arrested and police are reportedly investigating video footage from the cameras.
Another six-year-old child, this time a girl, was shot in the arm by a stray bullet Tuesday outside a house in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl is recovering and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is how I imagine the women’s team of gymnasts for this year’s Olympic Games, for several reasons.
First of all, I’ve been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And two: There are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren “Laurie” Hernandez, who have inspired so many young girls of color.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which is complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
Finally, we have a team that looks like America.
He also cemented the presence of black and Latino women at the forefront of the sport.
The number one gymnast of the past four years has been an African-American woman.
Simone and Gabby were in first and second place last year.
It means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became an Olympic champion and America cheered.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who performed unexpected but masterful gymnastics figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to win gold in the women's singles all-around.
And team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are witnessing a sporting peak, but in gymnastics classes in the country it does not look like that.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie made the same trip to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They are the “final five”, because the team of gymnasts for the next Olympic Games will consist of only four athletes, and this is the last year that Marta Karolyi trains.
However, the fact is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnasts train mainly in private gymnastic clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay the costs of trainings, equipment, trips, jerseys, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their wards and families).
Most of these sports clubs are in affluent suburban areas that can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all the training and for families of gymnasts and gymnasts it is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes at the time they started gymnastics.
It is our responsibility to bring gymnastics training that is more accessible and accessible to the communities of countless young girls who have inspired Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded the Gymnastics Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free or low-cost gymnastics in Harlem to more than 15,000 young people within the city (primarily of black and Hispanic origin) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means life-long benefits for good health, success at school and at work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send us thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics. And that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for showing “girl power” and winning Olympic team gold, and thank you for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to embark on the journey of becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to go on strike
Ministers had hoped that a renegotiated contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would bring an end to disagreements over the changes, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the election rejected the contract.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to enforce the contract, saying the NHS was in “no-man’s land” and further delays would have a detrimental impact on staff and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes in night and weekend working practices to improve care in non-social hours.
Ellen McCourt, MD, Chair of the BMA Commission on Young Doctors, said in a statement last night: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly in the sense that there will be an increase in the current workforce crisis and thus the fair treatment of all doctors.”
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors goes under the new contract, it is necessary to make progress and time is running out.
The BMA’s efforts to resolve disputes through negotiations have met with reluctance to involve Dr. and often with deafening silence from the government.
And this despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this option is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, press for enforcement and address the concerns of young doctors."
If this does not happen, then young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike in late April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed as nurses and specialists were called to replace doctors who were among the protesters.
The ministers hoped that after concluding a revised contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), disagreements regarding the changes would be concluded.
The BMA wants higher weekend work payments for the 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of NHS employers, urged young doctors not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: “The industry action will achieve little or nothing, but it will put pressure on already overburdened teams and services and increase concerns, exhaustion and disruption for patients, caregivers and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the board of young doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervision and informant.
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as workload, flexibility in training, further training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study leave and the gender pay gap - was evidenced by how seriously employers, Health Education and Health Minister agreements were achieved.
The drug for sixty crowns a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of a heart attack will be able to take the drug, which in terms of cost about sixty crowns (two pounds). Authorities recommend that it be administered to more patients over a longer period of time.
The anti-clotting medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of a heart attack in people with heart disease.
The drug is now administered for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or other attack.
The NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the drug be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, however, the NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year, and a quarter of them will have another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat, which forms a continuous layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer breaks off, a blood clot can form, block blood from entering the heart, and cause a heart attack.
If the clot is released, it can continue through the bloodstream, blocking blood supply to the brain and causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another attack.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces the risk by making clots less likely to occur.
The NICE proposal, which was published today, recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg together with aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who will suffer another heart attack or stroke – often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on a patient’s quality of life.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
We are pleased that with Ticagrelor’s preliminary recommendation, we can expand the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - in particular the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, treatment beyond this time is not recommended in the proposal.
With computer culture began to flourish fraud in Muslim areas
Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman was sacked last year for corruption linked to a government report.
A culture of political correctness has led to the neglect of rampant fraud in Muslim communities, a government report said today.
Ex-Minister Sir Eric Pickles has sharply criticised police, election inspectors and city hall for ignoring voter abuse for "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
A former community secretary, now the ruler of anti-corruption interventions, said bullying voters based on their religion is so bad that police should cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He recommended that voters take their ID with them and be able to prove who they are in the elections.
Currently, voters only need to provide their name and address.
In addition, the report proposes to apply indelible ink to the fingers of people when they cast their votes, in order to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, Pickles says.
It calls for the press to have greater access to meeting documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“It’s not just about protecting against voter fraud, it’s also about protecting the local government from the broader corruption environment and the financial fraud that goes along with it,” he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of an election scandal at Tower Hamlets in West London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the incumbent mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his post following allegations of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had “cynically intervened” in the religious sensibilities of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, in his own words, "has campaigned in such a way that it is the religious duty of devout Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were challenged or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and impersonates someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern about the fraud in the mail-in vote — which is said to have been used by senior members of the Muslim community to pressure people to vote for the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric, in the picture, gave several recommendations on how to clean the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document
The report states: “There has been evidence that vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities originating in Pakistan and Bangladesh.”
“There were concerns that ... state institutions were turning a blind eye to such behavior because of ‘politically correct’ hypersensitivity to ethnic origin and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including banning political activists from manipulating correspondence votes to prevent “voting exploitation.”
The report, which is now being evaluated by Theresa May, also calls for more thorough checks on registrations to prevent the use of voter lists for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consider asking voters to present proof of identity before voting.
Use indelible ink on people’s fingers when voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
Conducting systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that they can vote.
Requests for automatic correspondence voting shall be limited to three years.
Prohibit political agitators and activists from manipulating submitted correspondence votes and election envelopes.
Give the police permission to set up cordons around the polling stations.
To amend laws to make it easier to prosecute persons who exert unlawful pressure under the 1983 Reform Act.
Prohibit the taking of photographs in polling stations.
Require only Englishmen to work in polling stations (except for Wales).
Strengthen training and ensure that staff adhere to the rule that individual voters go to the polling booths.
Sir Eric has criticised London police, saying it is "surprising" that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlets case.
“The election court has ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for litany of corruption and illegal practices,” he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the strength of the evidence of the crime.
It also criticizes the fruitless "checkbox checks" in the voter registration departments of the town hall.
Sir Eric said: “The court’s decision last year in the Tower Hamlets case is a wake-up call.
Our nation has the proud legacy of the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some authorities threaten that reputation.
Infatuation with the cycling doppelganger Duchess Kate and other doppelgangers of famous personalities at the Olympics in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics have gone crazy this week for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who is strikingly similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is by no means the only gold-seeking athlete this year to boast her own celebrity doppelganger — at least not according to social media.
To celebrate the Rio Olympics and all the celebrities that are currently appearing on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who are more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
A member of the American archery team Brady Ellison (left) was compared to Leonardo DiCaprio from an early age
In addition to Kate’s doppelganger on the bike track, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be the twin of the star Leonard DiCaprio.
Team USA archer Brady Ellison caused a tempest on Twitter after his images emerged of him strikingly resembling a Wall Street wolf.
Brady himself noticed the media frenzy and admitted that he had heard about his resemblance to Lee since he was a child.
"He doesn't see much of a resemblance himself, except maybe his beard," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's cool and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be highlighted even more this year: the striking resemblance between British long-distance jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star of the series Gell Matthew Morrison for several years.
And for a change: The user thinks that Nathan with the "athlete version" of the actor from the film The Beginning (Inception)
Another long-standing comparison is that of tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimova boasts not only the same brown skin and blonde hair as Annalynne McCord. And about Nathan Adrian from the US team, fans say that he looks like an "athlete version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Capable women: soccer star Hope Solo (left) and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar face and eye shapes
Not just one: Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed the similarities
On the waves of theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similar appearance of couples
One Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction that “the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are in fact identical.”
Soccer star Hope Solo and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar shape of face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, or the gold medalist for gymnastics Gabby Douglas, proud of her gorgeously wide smile, which seemed to copy the stars' smile, Gabrielle's Bray smile.
CBC's Olympic commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer 'exploded'
Viewers of Wednesday's live broadcast of the Olympic Games on the CBC station were outraged by the analysis of the performance of fourteen-year-old Ai Yanhan commentator Byron MacDonald. The swimmer finished in fourth place in the women's 4x200 m freestyle relay
The Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “stretched like a stink” and “exploded” during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone had been turned off when, at the end of the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay final, he began spewing out his own opinions.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring “revival” to the CBC team of commentators, said, among other things: “The little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool.”
Too much excitement, it stretched like a stench, exploded.
Oh, thanks.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam to the second relay in 1:57.79, 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed the Canadians to catch up with China.
Viewers in Canada began to speak quickly online and were horrified by the tone and language used by the commentator
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: “Did the announcer say on CBC that a 14-year-old swimmer from China ‘exploded’????”
The idiot didn't notice he was still on the air."
Ai Yanhan of China in the final of the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay was described as, "That little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool."
Byron MacDonald's criticism on Twitter came from all sides and many demanded his removal
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald is, they didn’t hold back
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Soon after, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's live comment and said, "We apologize for the comment about the performance of the swimmer who escaped the broadcast."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we are sorry it happened.”
CBC Apologizes More Than 90 Times to People Who Tweeted in Response to Comments
Scott Russell Apologizes on behalf of MacDonald
The CBC then copied and pasted their apology in response to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about the comments of commentator MacDonald.
The station also quickly apologized and released a statement.
He sincerely regrets that the words were spoken, not to be aired.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and to those who follow us on social networks.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer herself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron deeply apologizes for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized on live television and tried to explain his remark by saying he didn’t want it to sound like a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize now for the comment I made last night after the women's relay," he said in a broadcast from the Olympics on CBC.
"I meant the performance of the swimmer, not the person of the swimmer as such."
"There's no need to say that I meant no disrespect, and I'm very sorry."
Primark customers outraged by a woman who shamelessly tried on lingerie in the middle of a store
When the woman undressed to try on panties in the middle of Primark, the shoppers weren't sure which way to look.
To make matters worse, she tried to fit her size, undressed her panties, and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to browse and finally tried out four pairs of panties in a shop at Bouverie Place in Flokestone.
Primark shop at Bouverie Place in Folkestone, where a woman tried on panties before putting them back on the shelf
The mother of two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said the mysterious woman, after trying on her underwear, “dressed up again and walked out of the store without buying anything.”
She said, "People couldn't believe their eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took her panties off the shelf, took off her own pantyhose and panties, and put them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place - she just stood there, brazen as a monkey."
"Everyone just stared at her taking off her panties again, and she obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same with three others before she finally decided she didn't like anything, got dressed again, and left.
"She didn't seem to mind who was watching - or even think of the man who might be buying the panties she was trying."
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "The idea of someone taking home panties that someone else was wearing and nobody cleaned them up is disgusting."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “When she left, I was picking up things that I was obviously trying to get off the market – which is also the only thing that’s right.”
"I'd be terrified to bring home new panties and find out they were worn by another woman, undressed and not washed."
A Primark store spokesman said: “Primark is aware of an incident that occurred at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9th.”
All the products concerned were withdrawn from sale.
How to defend yourself against a weapon attack with Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com it could be a little safer for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, the grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation based in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain the upper hand over the bully, whether he approaches you from the front or from the back.
If he approaches you from behind, Mizrachi says, then the first thing you need to do is turn around to see your attacker and “have a free shot track.”
Then you grab the gun between your forearm and shoulder just before you hit it in the face with your free elbow.
Then he follows the knee to the groin, and while the attacker is writhing in pain, you twist the gun out of his hand, hit the main one in the face and start to retreat, while holding the gun aimed at him.
If an armed man is approaching you from the front, it is a similar technique - get your body out of the firing line, grab the gun and twist it so that the villain can not shoot.
At the same time, put strength into the weapon and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the weapon from his grip and start to retreat, still aiming at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, though, that the safest way to get out of an ambush - if you're not the grandmaster of Krav Maga - is to issue all the cash.
Traveler Ian Wright Licks Europe's Dirtiest Places in a Travel Guide
A British traveler has decided to put his immune system and gag reflex to the test by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Moderator and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, originally from Suffolk, licked a euro note, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a flush button on a train toilet, and a Russian public telephone with his tongue to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he was getting into.
The experiment, which was based on the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, brought interesting results.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train, which has been used by thousands of other people, may seem completely repulsive, but in fact, there are many more harmful bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip to Europe, Ian Wright spoke to doctors and health professionals about strengthening gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left him with anything worse in his mouth than the taste.
Ian Wright is famous for testing the resistance of his intestines on trips around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he safely tested his immune system - from public railings at train stations to a flushing system.
In a film he made about it, he says: “Since I was a child, I didn’t care much about my health, and I put everything in my mouth, from clay to eating worms and muddy water.”
In the film, his reputation was confirmed.
The only thing he refused was dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple swab, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
But one public toilet in Russia refused to lick it after its luminometer showed more than 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60.
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio made a travel film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the numbers of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, he said, "This is almost the most disgusting thing I've ever felt in a bathroom."
There's nothing dirtier than this!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
The film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was made in cooperation with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help strengthen gut bacteria and the immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio’s senior vice president of snacks, juices and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would follow the passion and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We came up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended up with the idea of "let's call Ian."
It is said that interest in gut health is becoming a worldwide phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a broader context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy bowels is a worldwide phenomenon and through this document we have brought consumers more detailed information in an interesting way.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: "Let's put it this way, Ian would lose my respect if he licked something I wanted from him - like that disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film."
Licking some things was naturally easier for Ian, while others were pretty hard.
I’m glad that we licked some of those dirty things.”
Valio conducted a survey in 2015, according to which 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria primarily with the health of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent of respondents said that they at least occasionally use products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
Family of Socially Needed Before Eviction Destroys Municipal Building in Saltash, Cornwall
A family of social workers has left <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 in damage at their town hall after being accused of terrorising their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their home in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their forcible eviction from the house, housing co-operative officials were shocked to discover that the property was in a state of emergency.
There were holes in the walls, the floor covering was torn, there was litter all over the floor, and the walls were stained.
The family has already moved out and is believed to be living in private accommodation.
Donna McEvoy, director of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was concerned about whether the house could be saved.
She said: “It was a nightmare for the people here, and I don’t think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, as this property is likely to come to light as a “not-so-nice part” of Cornwall.
The family is infamous, and their names are infamous.
The couple has three sons, who have occasionally stayed at the house, and police said the horrors the family had unleashed included street battles using baseball bats, bullying, drug use, drug distribution, and loud shouting, fighting, and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was sentenced in June for anti-social behaviour.
In several rooms in the house, which may be torn down, smelly garbage was found.
In the house from which drugs were distributed in the past, a floor covering was torn out
Neighbors say they saw them fighting in the street, and people regularly called the police.
Cornwall Housing moved her and her partner out of the house this week after they were given an additional 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
Neighbors who were relieved welcomed the eviction, saying their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, “They didn’t care about anyone at all.”
We've lived with them for 20 years and it's always been this way.
How many times we've seen the police here can't be counted at all.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because there was an incredible silence - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing’s neighborhood supervisor, said the family had been unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, police were regularly called to the house
Waste and old toys piled up in the overgrown part of the municipal house
He adds: “It is a shame that the tenant has failed to take responsibility for her own behavior and that of her family. eviction is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
It was a very complicated case because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, must have frightened her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall Police, and the members of the local community who have bravely informed us.
I hope that this step will bring a little comfort to the neighbors and at the same time carry with it the message that we will not tolerate unsocial behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons of the tenant who lived in the house at different times were about 20 years old.
Contaminated mattress, which after eviction remained on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house
Workers will now have to remove piles of garbage left around the house
In 2014, the police raided the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, weight, equipment and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of possession of Class B drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed the money was intended for the foundations of a house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Tanya and her eviction partner are now believed to be living in private accommodation in Plymouth.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted with graffiti.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who violate the rules of their rental contracts
Angela Crow of Denovo and Cornwall Police said the eviction was sending a clear message to other tenants who would continue to break the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity, and to those who would like to follow such behavior," she said.
The Denova and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and unsocial behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal terrified after low-flying military jet over beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sun’s rays in Portugal’s Aveiro were scared to death
The Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft flew at an incredibly low altitude.
The Air Force said it was a training flight and insisted there was no threat to safety.
As the low-flying jet crashed over the crowded beach, the frightened tourists panicked.
Dramatic footage shows a military plane getting close to the sun-drenched people on a sandy beach near the town of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to rise after being disturbed by the noise of jet aircraft engines, without seeing what would emerge from the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon on the Costa Nova near the town of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several vacationers who posted videos of the dramatic flyby on social media, said: “The plane flew twice really low and at one point it seemed to crash.”
Nuno Arroja adds, “I was surfing and I really thought the plane would fall on my head.”
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when a low-flying plane appeared out of the darkness
The Portuguese Air Force said on Tuesday that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to take it low because it was the only way to check the boats.
The aircraft reportedly flew slightly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires, but the Air Force insists that human safety has not been compromised.
Forest fires this summer destroyed part of mainland Portugal and claimed four lives on the island of Madeira.
Portugal's Air Force said the pilot had to fly low because of heavy fog and smoke from fires that prevented him from seeing.
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify the fishing boats as part of the training.
Half of funeral services don't follow the rules.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with the legislation.
The Czech Trade Inspection Authority (<0xC4><0x8C>OI) found this during inspections in the second quarter.
According to her, funeral services most often do not inform the survivors about their prices or do not issue a written confirmation of receipt of the order.
The <0xC4><0x8C>OI imposed 41 fines totalling CZK 73,000.
This was announced today by its spokesman Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Fr<0xC3><0xB6>hlich.
The inspectors found errors in 47 of the 95 inspections.
In addition to not informing about prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially unverified meter.
The inspection therefore banned the sale of 23 products for a total of CZK 7,077.
It concerned packaging for urns, candle covers and vases that were not properly marked with mandatory information.
"Given that there is still a violation of the law in this specific area of services, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fr<0xC3><0xB6>hlich added.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
It was reported that Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS, has died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnim Akunjee said the family learned of her death in Raqqa a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that she was likely killed during a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the stronghold of the group in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just as she was preparing to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
“One wants to believe that the only good thing about the whole thing — as a message and a warning to others that these are the real dangers of going to a war zone — is that it will deter people from ever making a decision,” Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then boarded a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultana family learned that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says that if Clinton is elected, she will keep Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is confident that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland’s nomination, even though President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the person who replaces the late Supreme Court Justice will be chosen by the future president.
During a conference call on Thursday, Reid said he believed Clinton would choose Garland "with some degree of credibility."
Reid’s spokesman later said he had not directly spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland, and that he was only speculating.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want to “rock the boat” by choosing someone else.
Garland is the president of the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington.
Reid said the Republicans who are blocking Garland’s appointment are “slugs” and “sniffers” of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is not fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars are for “women and men.”
Treats magazine is working closely with photographer David Bellemer to release a calendar for 2017, inspired by the Pirelli calendar of the 1970s.
But instead of revealing celebrities, NU Muses is trying to find the next generation of top models for its 2017 calendar.
The president of Treats, Steve Shaw, told us earlier this year that his magazine full of nudity was different from the old-school Playboy because “Playboy is for men.”
I do it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar does, too.
“We need to get back to showing timeless and classic nudity, where women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by photographs of the female body,” Shaw said in a statement.
Women want to be a part of this project because it is a wonderful piece of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or in person during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does vinyl go: who really buys gramophone records?
Vinyl is loved by lonely middle-aged men.
Before you decide to fill the comments section with peppy comments under the pseudonym Not AllSingleMenIn the Middle Ages, we note that this statement is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurrection of phonograph records is associated not with the boom of millennials who want to admire the originality of owning a physical object, but with middle-aged nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought an album on vinyl are most likely people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It’s not really about hoarding an enthusiastic fan either – it’s all about the emotional dimension: older people who buy phonograph records are more likely to want to keep their feelings (56% versus 53%) and like to be alone (69% versus 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were broadcast as a TV report, I would be followed by a camera as I head out to a busy street in Soho, dressed in a decent gray suit and gesturing broadly. Then I would stop, pull my arms out and say something authoritative, like, “Let’s take a look at this.”
Well, let's take a look at it.
While the charm and charm of Soho’s heart is slowly fading – buildings once occupied by independent retailers are now filled with hotels, restaurants and dining, ready-to-wear and office supplies – a few fantastic specialty record stores still remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while, and I'll stand next to the different men in these stores and try to observe what their age and emotional state is.
Stuart, 55, a native of Glasgow, whom I follow from Sister Ray (counts: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counts: eight middle-aged men, one woman about 20), has a meeting in London in the afternoon and looks at the shops to fill a few hours of time.
I asked him if he was a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
All these recordings line the walls of his living room - in the picture above (he sent me the photo by e-mail, I did not follow him all the way home).
This huge number of albums and singles is also due to the fact that he can afford it: he can now buy gramophone records that he could not afford when they were originally released, and again buys what he sold in his youth and did not even have a vindra.
“A lot of what I buy is from the late 60s and early 70s. These are things that would have been issued when I was 11 or 12. I was too small at the time and couldn’t get them,” she says.
He agrees that those who buy the tapes are probably introverts who love the company of themselves, and adds: “I don’t smoke or drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez, 25, works at Sister Ray and also thinks that many of the customers he meets fit into the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people influenced by the media wave, people who had heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy their old records back.
According to my interviews, people got rid of their collections most often between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their records and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records back,” he says.
This could explain the boom of record lovers of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional importance of gramophone records?
It won’t take you more than a few seconds to find out in a store like Phonica that there’s a nice community of people with a similar mindset in the music stores.
According to Weza, some older customers are particularly offended by the contactless payment system.
Some fans of phonograph records may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and have opted for the familiar environment of phonograph records packaging, things that evoke memories of peaceful adolescence.
“I think filling a gap or owning something material can bring some comfort,” Wez says.
I’m a collector myself, and I think a lot of people are too.
It's an easy way to fill a place in your head.
“We’re all like their social workers!” says a co-worker from a pile of gramophone records.
An ICM survey in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not yet listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of respondents have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy turntables do not have a turntable.
At this point in the story, he probably looked seriously concerned about going through a pile of bossa nova compilations.
The aspect of “trophy” and reviving interest is something Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men), has noticed.
“Someone recently came in and said, ‘I don’t have a turntable yet, but I want to buy it on Radiohead so we can put it on the shelf,’” she says.
The percentage is not high, but it is happening.
It’s more about the product page than the music.
There are people who come to us and say, "I don't have a turntable."
These are the younger people, not the older, grown-up teenagers who are getting into it.
Fopp, where almost the entire floor is currently reserved for gramophone records, has much more diverse visitors when I come.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere isn’t as relaxed as the stores used to be – instead of towing jazz, the latest pop from Wild Beasts full of synths and sex is heard from the speakers, so it’s good to see a variety of customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but you can hardly guess the intrusive mental trauma when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) walks for a few minutes in Fop and looks at various gramophone records at a discount.
She's one of those people who looks at the shop windows rather than frantically spending.
According to her, she does not earn much, so it is not considered that she would collect gramophone records.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something, but gramophone records have their magic...," he sighs longingly.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a store that supposedly inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I pretend to be very interested in the calves of girls in tight jeans and watch a group of teenage girls who are just clustering around Polaroid cameras. Then the father and daughter decide to buy a Crosley turntable.
On the left is a staircase, the wall of which is covered by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac <0xCC><0x81>s phonograph records: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of phonograph records.
No one is looking at them - maybe because they're just for decoration, and some are so high on the wall that you can't reach them.
It's just a vinyl trick.
But since any attraction to him could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of Soho for more, there’s not much to complain about.
Unsurprisingly, the demographic area where more time and money is likely to be spent than in other areas is also where the most luxury goods like vinyl are spent.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov’s results are accurate — at least in record stores — they don’t account for the large number of collectors and vinyl lovers that actually exist in record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
I'm sure he doesn't spend Thursday morning wandering around the record stores on Berwick Street, browsing through records and avoiding the sight of a strange 30-year-old fake TV host hiding behind the backs of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
The Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest life expectancy of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the recording shows a female, estimated to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters tall.
French court rejects order to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an order by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais objected that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, sell tea for 50 cents or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The prefect’s office in Calais argued that the sites must be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they pose fire and health risks.
Aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants were vital and that free meals offered by state-backed associations and other groups did not provide a food allowance for the growing numbers of refugees in the camp.
Controversial makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis to prevent people from operating 72 temporary stores, but said the prefect's objections were "completely understandable".
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants have a much bigger role than just serving food to people who “live in extremely desperate conditions.”
He said the premises provide quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites at risk of demolition was the camp’s cafe, Jungle Book Kids, run by a non-profit organization that offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the “children’s” cafe.
The Guardian has received a letter saying the closure of the cafe “would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old.”
Charitable organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the camp after a sharp increase in arrivals during the summer has risen to more than 9,000 - the highest ever recorded.
He thought he was dead.
It is upsetting to him and to the volleyball players.
"I have been able to train normally since March," he said at the start of summer training in full force.
What's the matter with you?
I had a bilateral pulmonary embolism, and then heart problems.
Because when I was at the university in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble was caused by a long flight to Asia?
I had a clot in my calf for two years and I didn't know it.
I was in pain, no one found anything.
Then the clot came up.
There is a damaged vein in the calf, which will hurt all the time, especially when it is working or the weather is changing.
But nothing that limits me is more of an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about your life?
He did.
Last year at the summer tournament in D<0xC5><0x99>ev<0xC4><0x9B>nice, I did not know that I had an embolism, and I could not move there at all.
I was vomiting blood tonight.
The doctors told me that it was something completely different, I was still five days completely done.
I really thought I was dead in D<0xC5><0x99>ev<0xC4><0x9B>nice, including my girlfriend and family.
I've seen myself somewhere else before.
How did you come to terms with that?
I guess I had to go through it, now it's just going up.
I know I have some blood problems, that I have to be more careful when I fly somewhere.
But you can do anything with it.
Only when I wanted to return to the preparation of P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>bram last year, there were still problems with the heart.
Everything's fine now.
Since March, I have been preparing myself at home to be able to play again.
I'll knock, I'm physically better off than before.
What do you expect from the mouth?
I'm looking forward to it, the group looks good, I know most of the guys.
I'm curious about the other two foreigners who are coming.
I hope we can sit down in a humane way so that we can fit together.
Will you raise the mouth?
He had a reputation as a knockout, but every season is different.
Brno two years ago was the eighth, now the second ended.
There is a new team in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>, there are only a few players left.
It was the last in the extralition, so there is a lot of room for improvement.
How we use it is up to us.
We'll see after the first laps who's gonna be the batter, we probably won't.
Is Coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He's experienced and experienced a lot, he'll think better than last place.
But my coming here didn't have anything to do with him. I made a deal earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, with one I am a great friend and it was agreed that he would work here.
I won't say the name.
Finally, Mr. Brom came and I'm glad.
He has a great name, he has been in good clubs, he has been training for many decades, he is a former good player.
He'll move us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to joke and I like to get an opportunity in a not so top team.
I was in P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>bram for two years, but <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team, because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned a foreigner, Australian Boehm is already training in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>.
What's he look like?
I happen to know him, we played against each other in a group at the Universiade.
And we talked a few times there, sometimes we sat together in the evening after games, so we already know each other in a friendly way.
We beat them 3-1, right at the start of the summer training in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he's a nice guy.
The American Nadazdin and the Brazilian Ze will arrive.
Do you know anything about them?
I wrote to an American, he looks like a nice guy, a Brazilian who knows how he will be able to speak English.
Did you contact the American?
It seemed like a good idea.
I'm a recording artist, so I should communicate with everyone.
I immediately found out what kind of player he is, I found him playing on the Internet, I saw some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the guy jumps, he's tall.
We wrote a few messages on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he fits in with us.
How do you look forward to being number one?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I am 24 years old and I don’t have the guts to move.
I'd rather be at the center of the action, I'd rather lead the team than be led by someone else.
I probably wouldn’t want to play anymore if I had to be like a second record player and do it full-time. When you don’t do something fully, it sucks.
How many times have you been number one?
Half a year in P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>bram, when it did not work for Kust as a captain, he got injured, then there were problems with money and he left.
Since then, we've been going up and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, of which I am a foster parent, I alternated between one and two.
An excellent year was in the Old Town, after it I had a lot of offers and chose P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>bram.
From there, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice wanted me, I stayed, but I did not finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short sofa remains the Phelps domain.
"Being back on the podium and hearing the anthem is as sweet as ever," Phelps laughed, his eyes full of tears again.
His fiancée and mother were cheering in the auditorium again, and Boomer's son was sleeping peacefully with headphones on this time.
I'm having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started swimming racing and in a few hours it will be over, he said moved.
In the final behind Phelps almost two seconds behind the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won the long stretch.
Bronze won the Chinese Wang Shun, bronze medalist in this discipline from last year's World Championship.
After Al Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (distant), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to master the same discipline in four games in a row.
For most of the race, Phelps and Ryan Lochte led the race, along with Thiago Perreira.
While the defender of gold in the final reigning fifty put on a crushing finish, they fell out of the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance to expand his unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the official announcement of the podium, he advanced to the final of the 100-meter butterfly race.
The legend could not be overshadowed even by compatriot Ryan Murphy, who won a sign double - after a hundred he won a double track in Rio.
In the final, he left behind by 37 hundred Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin, the Russian Evgeny Rylov finished third.
While Murphy is only fifth out of 200 at last year’s World Championships, he has become a marquee king in Rio.
He dethroned Larkin, who won the same double at last year's World Championships.
He has just won a medal at the Olympics.
Canadian Penny Oleksiakova and American Simone Manuel shared the gold on the squire’s hundred.
For 16-year-old Oleksiakova it was the fourth medal at these games, for Manuela it was the second after silver from the relay.
She won swimming gold as the first African-American woman in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
“This medal is for all those who come after me, sport will become love for them and they will get where I am,” Manuela said.
The third was the Swedish Sarah Sj<0xC3><0xB6>str<0xC3><0xB6>m, who won the world record in the 100-meter butterfly race in Rio and still has silver from the 200-meter curler.
Australian record holder Cate Campbell finished sixth.
Japan's Rie Kanet, who won her first Olympic medal at the age of twenty-seven, won the women's 200.
It does not have any precious metal from the World Championship, its maximum was fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver medal in Rio was won by Russia’s Yulia Yefimova, who, despite her doping past, is struggling with the hostility of spectators and rivals.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should keep answering these questions.
“I’m so tired of it,” said the Russian swimmer.
The right to start in Rio was claimed only by a special panel of CAS sports arbitration just before the start of the games.
They dealt with my appeal, and I won.
Whether someone likes it or not, or if they have a different opinion, they should go to the arbitration court, she added.
Disappointment, we could have won.
And start at midnight?
I don't remember.
The Czechs had a special day.
Less than an hour before the game, they knew who they were going to face.
They had to be able to do tactical training in a flash.
And then, at an unusual time, they started the match on the small court number 1.
The first set did not start well, then they reached the lead of the opponents, but at 19:19 they did not manage the finish line.
In the second, they were clearly better and equalized, but the decisive tie-break did not work out for them.
In particular, a number of broken services meant a 10:15 loss and a farewell to the Olympic tournament.
"We could have beaten the Russians," Hermann regretted.
How would you rate the match?
Hermannová: After the unfortunate start, before I played out, we got into the game beautifully.
At the end of the last balloon, I lost the income I had gotten used to before.
We lost that set, which was key.
In the next set we got on them with an overview on the pitch, a different defense and we pressed on the service.
There was a lot of bad submissions in the tie-break, and that's where we cleaned up on this side.
It was disappointing because we could beat the Russians.
It’s a shame about the start of the first set, we missed it.
We were able to download it, but we were missing the spikes.
The second set was great and the third set was decided by the service.
We've made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points and it was about five, we hesitated a lot there.
It is a pity, because the Russians were playable.
How did you play in the No. 1 court?
Sluková: Similar to China in the side yards.
The atmosphere and environment were different.
It was one o'clock in the morning, complete silence, no music, nothing.
That was the difference from the center.
We would not choose such conditions, but we cannot choose.
How was the preparation for the match when you found out the names of the opponents an hour before the match?
Hermann: She was special.
We started to warm up to the game without knowing the opponents, so we couldn’t make tactical preparations like the other teams.
But Simon (coach Nausch) had prepared a tactic for almost all the options that were there.
He had a lot of tactical papers in hand, so we were pretty well prepared in that regard.
Remember when you started the game at midnight?
Hermann: Probably not.
We played at 11:30, but not at 12.
Block of Russia Birlov in the play-offs at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermannová hugged in the play-offs at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Was it unpleasant?
Sluková: By playing the last two matches in the group of ten, we had moved the regime earlier.
This was two more hours.
It’s strange, I can’t imagine that another sport has athletes who have to perform their best at twelve o’clock.
But I think we prepared as best we could.
We knew it was going to be like that, but it’s not quite typical and it probably won’t be my favorite time to play.
What do you think of the Olympic experience?
Hermannová: Since the progress from the group was our goal, on the one hand, it’s okay, good.
We did what we said.
But now I'm sad after the game.
Sluková: I will sleep through it and from tomorrow I will remember the Olympic tournament only positively.
Big Brother is here, here comes the first surveillance sim.
You can't escape her.
The new rules are intended to apply to all persons without a Thai passport who, while staying in Thailand, decide to acquire a SIM from one of the local operators.
That is, not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas, who, for example, work in Thailand or have entered into a marriage there.
The Secretary General of the Office of National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, Takorn Tantasith, said there would be no exceptions.
The plan to sell SIMs exclusively to foreigners was introduced by the national telecoms regulator in early August.
The new measures, which will allow monitoring of their location, are planned to be implemented by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a means of preserving national security, which will allow solving crimes committed by foreigners.
In addition, so-called tourist SIMs are designed to help detect people who exceed the permitted length of stay.
For retailers, within six months, a special SIM for foreigners should appear next to the SIM intended exclusively for Thais.
The difference will be the tracking function, which will be permanently turned on for cards intended for people without a Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This feature is not available in SIM for Thais, because we can always easily track them," Tantasith added.
It should be added that in Thailand, subscriptions are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires proof of identity.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators distributed free SIM start-ups to tourists at airports.
They were completely anonymous.
Ten telecom regulators from other Asian countries, including Malaysia and Singapore, are considering introducing the same measure as Thailand.
They also currently have a mandatory SIM registration, but legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the planned measure does not imply an obligation for foreigners to acquire a local operator upon entering the SIM country.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
Operators of a given country, after crossing the border, i.e. after logging SIM to their network, only know the relevant network information.
They know the phone number, but not the information about the owner.
However, the difference in roaming prices compared to the rates of local operators is so glaring that most tourists during their stay in Thailand begin to look for local SIMs.
The authorities’ efforts to monitor the movement of foreigners have been met with immediate criticism from foreigners living in Thailand.
Tantasith calms the situation and compares the planned system to the obligation to provide a residential address in immigration documents in connection with the protection of privacy.
In addition, if necessary, the police will need a court order to monitor a particular person.
Any abuse of the system will be subject to an unspecified penalty.
“If the service provider tracks the SIM’s location without a court order, it will be charged with a crime,” Tantasith added.
In addition, the system should maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While there is currently a recycling of a specific number after the 90-day period after which the SIM did not log in to the network, the number could now be renewed after 15 days if you leave Thailand.
Luxury apartment in a new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and a hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment, where most of the care of the property will be provided by the administrator.
The condition was enough parking spaces and an elevator in the house, which basically disqualified the older development.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with rocking the floor, high energy intensity and the like.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old building is not able to offer.
Other interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern apartment.
The whole interior was designed for you by the architect Lenka Langerová and her colleague Kamila Poláková from Artiga studio.
Why did you just address them?
Would you recommend working with an expert to anyone?
We would recommend cooperation with an architect to everyone, if he proposes an apartment from the beginning, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second level is the interior design itself: designers have a significantly better idea of the range of possible materials and, based on the client's wishes, are able to properly harmonize the interior.
We worked with the architect Lenka Langerová on our mountain apartment, then based on the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us during the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social-residential space with adequate facilities for a family of four conceived as a modern, but not cold interior.
The priority was to achieve the connection of the apartment with the terraces and to implement intelligent control of the household.
And, of course, the quality of the execution had to be preserved.
Did you leave everything to the experts, or did you yourself interfere with the final form of the interior?
We approved all designs, including technical drawings and samples of materials, however, the design always came from architects.
At the beginning, we set out what we expect from the design and showed some interior elements that we would like to include in the design, for example, carpets or paintings.
I think that our collection of mostly Czech authors, including works by Karel Malich, Karel Vysu<0xC5><0xA1>il, Václav <0xC5><0xA0>pála or Otto Gutfreund, helped the architect to orient herself in our taste.
Also, the combination of black, white and walnut wood was the idea of the architect as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc.
Were there any complications during the implementation, due to which you had to give up the original ideas, or, conversely, proceed to new ones?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the building at the moment when it was first possible to climb to the height of our floor, and found that the views that we planned, in fact, shade the surrounding buildings.
Then we literally changed the layout overnight from the ground up.
Granite was used on the kitchen line and on the lining of the fireplace wall.
The interior is dominated by wooden surfaces complemented by leather, for example, the upholstery of Norma dining and bar chairs from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you making any changes here or is there something you would like to have differently today?
I believe that this is a modern air interior, which primarily fulfills its purpose.
We are not planning any changes, most of the modifications after moving in took place in the plane of shielding and housing of the terraces.
Perhaps the only reproach is to the floor, when the walnut wood turns out to be too delicate for a household with a dog.
The word of architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, author of the realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, so it was possible to make a completely new layout and several other modifications within the construction.
For the interior, an important element is the placement of light pipes in the ceiling of the hallway and the main toilet.
This brought daylight into the darker areas of the apartment.
Also, the direct entrance from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the construction modifications that was very beneficial for the function of the whole apartment.
It also includes a swimming pool and hot tub.
Compared to the French, you are not negative, says a Muslim woman living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are originally from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, not far from the Spanish border.
I've moved quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalism, thanks to which I got to work in a magazine.
Why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was beginning to feel like I was suffocating in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Mainly because of the atmosphere.
I thought every Frenchman was awfully negative.
People in France are generally negative, but things have gotten worse recently.
It's interesting that you're talking about negativity.
This is how some people view the Czech character.
Trust me, you're not negative compared to the French.
Some people may not feel this way when they come to France, because as tourists they do not perceive it so much.
But it was too much for me.
The big issue is money.
People feel that they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which, in my opinion, is enough.
Now there is a problem with the behavior of people towards Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor began to look at me through his fingers just because I was a Muslim.
It's like I'm some kind of evil.
I did not feel well in France.
My family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for work basically anywhere else and I came across a vacancy at Air France here in Prague.
I must admit that I did not know Prague at all from the beginning.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I did not know what to expect from Prague at all.
I've been here for three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Mainly because of a different atmosphere.
Maybe it’s because I don’t speak Czech, so I can’t catch any negative reactions or swear words, but I feel like there are more free people here.
That I could do anything, dress any way I wanted, and no one would judge me.
In France, someone is always looking at you unpleasantly, for example, when you have special clothes and the like.
In Prague, I started to feel really free.
I don't think roasters care about that sort of thing.
Where do you work now?
After working at Air France, I worked for a travel website for a while.
Then a friend of mine and I started a website where people offer and look for shared housing.
So far, we only operate in Prague, but we would like to extend it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends who are half Czech, and two Czech friends.
I must say that another peculiarity of the Czechs is that at first they keep more distance.
He won't let anyone get close to him.
That’s quite a difference from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses each other on the cheek.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural thing, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned that you don't speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, I have it quite simple in Prague, because everyone here speaks English.
Even in the evenings or in food.
I would like to learn Czech, but I don’t have that much time.
And by the fact that everyone can communicate in English at least a little, I do not have such a need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone to help me.
Have you had any negative reactions?
Is it because you are a Muslim?
Not really.
Perhaps it is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience comes to mind.
My manager, the Czech Republic, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense: They are not French, they are Africans.
That touched me quite a bit.
But that someone would have a problem with me being a Muslim has never happened to me before.
And this despite the fact that a colleague once warned me about some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me not to go downtown, that I'd be scolded.
Anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly linked to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something similar to Paris, Nice or Brussels could happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is that nowadays, anything can happen anywhere.
Until recently, I could not imagine that such a thing would happen in France.
This is not just about Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not recognize violence at all.
For me, the people who kill are not Muslims.
The Qur’an says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists protect themselves with your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, even if I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I try not to follow the reports of violence, but every time I read something, I feel like apologizing for something that's not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for being a terrorist?
We met in the square of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>ho z Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brad.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims and Christians demonstrated against the violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they disagree with violence.
I don't think they have to do anything like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't do?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
My co-workers are, for example, from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They’re a little more religious than I am, so sometimes we have pretty wild discussions about Islam because we all see it a little differently.
I come from France, so I went through a different education, for example, they learned Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordination of women.
How do you feel about it?
I do not feel subordinate in any way.
On the contrary.
I'm a woman, I have strength.
It also has to do with the fact that you are not wearing any headgear.
Hijab, for example?
And it's mostly about the way I was raised.
My mother, for example, is a devout Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but he just doesn't wear a headscarf.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It all depends on how you interpret it.
When a person reads the Qur’an, he should make up his own mind about these things.
So when I read in the Qur’an a passage that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said to myself: I am not the Prophet’s wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect that, and when I come to Iran or Saudi Arabia, for example, where scarves are required, I take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
I've never felt so good anywhere else.
I’ve been thinking about Poland for a while, but I’m great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Prague is an ideal city for this.
Czech Muslims, along with Christians, demonstrated against violence.
Sailor Kozelska Fencl ’ s wind in Rio blew on the step-by-step steps.
Friday's rides at sea in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, came out Czech yachtswoman Veronica Kozelská Fenclová.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved up to tenth place before the final two races.
This would ensure that the Czechs would participate in the final race.
You collect packages like Pokémon.
They want to compete with the carriers.
TV director Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka and manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger are behind the idea of using the already planned routes for the transport of consignments.
With the idea, they breathed life into a trio of applications with different geographical reach.
We launched the national application of the Transfer in May.
At the moment, there are a thousand cities recorded in it, and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we first want to learn this, before we focus more on foreign countries, says a forty-one-year-old manager in an interview with iDNES.cz.
How does the Transfer app work and who can benefit from it?
Download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and data, how big a package you can transport and how much you want for it.
Someone else might be looking for a ride that day.
When the route and time of delivery are suitable, it is paired and both will receive a mutual notification.
At that moment, a chat will open, where the couple will arrange a handover.
How many people do you think would have to register in order for each package to always find its courier?
I do not know the ideal state, I cannot estimate how many registered and how many paths are needed to make the coverage completely optimal and each offer matched the demand.
It already works on the main routes and it is logically easier than on the road between the villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
In the meantime, people are building trust and finding out that no one escapes with the package.
You haven't had to deal with a case like this yet?
How many users does the service have after two months from launch?
We currently have about 5,000 to 6,000 people making the roads.
We consider this a success and we believe that more will be added.
Is there a risk that the sender will wait too long?
We hope that we will be a competitor for large conglomerates just because we are able to deliver the thing for the same day and for a fraction of the price.
For a large company, you will pay several thousand for delivery within two hours.
Here you will pay maybe a hundred or less, because this is the path that someone is already doing.
Should traditional carriers be concerned about a possible loss of customers in the future?
We hope so.
The market has huge potential, with huge multinational carriers feeding here, as well as retail chains where they all started shopping and gradually found out that the quality did not match what they were paying for.
No one wants to find tickets in the mailbox with a message that he has to pick up the shipment at the branch, first of all on the day after 7 p.m.
At that time I needed the package for six hours and I waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that will not bother anyone and will send a signal to the competition, let them try.
Marek Greger (41) and Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka (39).
None of them have ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a manager of a music club, Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka as a television director.
In 2014, they started preparing the Shippansee LTD application, which uses the already planned routes between the world’s capitals, mainly by plane, to transport packages.
In 2015, they commissioned a project to process a company that created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or <0xC4><0x8C>SFD.
The programming took three-quarters of a year and the app was launched in March 2016.
They started developing the app in December last year and released it in May this year.
This is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
The app has been in development since January and was made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was from the beginning to make all of these applications one day merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to fine-tune the application and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the global market.
The shared economy has been a topic lately and this is an AirBnB or Uber service.
Are you not worried about operating in an area that no one can say much about, where is the border of sharing and where are the grey economies?
It’s the same thing, just a different product.
It is clear to us that if it succeeds and we go up with it, we will be another thorn in the side of the gray economy.
But even if someone saves and someone makes a profit, it is not the intention to bypass the tax authorities and tax controls.
Every user, on one side or the other, will be encouraged to tax his income if he makes it.
What makes you think the service has so much potential?
The shipper saves money and the carrier earns or reduces the cost of travel.
This is the strong idea that unites the interest on both sides.
In the age of social media, which divides people, we would like this one to bring people closer together.
They can create nice stories, people are happy that they helped someone and will talk about it.
Perhaps someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
People, in my opinion, have been missing a personal approach for a long time, we say that this application is a service to people.
So how do you ensure that the courier does not run away with the package?
Each user of the application, together with the registration, scans the ID card and indicates the bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are channels that give the service and the person credibility.
Couriers also collect stars based on sender ratings.
We also offer insurance, we are still fine-tuning the details.
The courier is liable for the uninsured shipment in case of loss or damage, but does not assume responsibility for the contents under criminal law if there is something illegal inside and he does not know about it.
If he is stopped by the police and finds a machine gun or ten kilos of hashish in a sealed package in his trunk, the sender is criminally liable.
Is there a risk of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
Registered persons are, if necessary, traceable by the administrative authority, which alone will be able to inspect it, even we ourselves are not able to see them, the data is protected against abuse.
How much money will the courier receive after successful delivery of the parcel?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he asks for.
The sender will be charged a few percent extra for the mediation of the contact.
This money is our profit, but it is only a few percent, because we want to push the volume.
No one can accuse the courier of not delivering the shipment when in fact he delivered it, the receipt and delivery are verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can transport anything.
We have three sizes, small as a cube of butter, medium as a plate of eggs and large as a bass beer.
After that, there are no more restrictions and if someone has a place in the car, they will move the refrigerator.
Plus, the sender has the option to take a picture of the package in the application, so the courier can see what he wants.
You don’t even have to pack a thing if you don’t want to hide the contents.
You put the forgotten sweatshirt in the courier's hand and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to start the service?
A friend got the idea more than two years ago, then I did not pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demo application with a multinational reach, which mainly targets passengers by plane.
At that moment, I told him that I would not look for an investor, but I would like to become one myself and put savings into it.
It took another year of development before we established Shippansee LTD in London, due to the greater credibility of the entire product.
This is not the version you are focusing on right now.
No, we focused marketing on the Czech Republic, where we are trying to catch up with the application, because it all had birth pains and there is still something to solve and improve.
We are trying to respond to customer feedback and we are currently not dealing with the foreign market as much.
We know it’s a long run, but we don’t do it, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were upgrades in a way.
The transfer came about when we thought that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application of Mes<0xC3><0xAD>kem is local, for the city.
But it can send a package to the exact address and to the other end of the world.
It works for the sender as well as the transfer, but the difference is that as a courier, you see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in your mobile.
Applications for couriers who want to make a living from it, we called the Month of Profi.
So someone can make a lot of money by picking up packages around town?
Exactly, the last application will be downloaded in Prague by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to earn their way to work.
Now that everyone's messing around with those Pokémon, they can collect this just the same.
You can see where there are orders around the city, come to it, click and see when it has to be delivered and carry the shipment.
It is set up cheaper than competitive services.
At the moment, we are still making a web interface that will be crucial for companies to send parcels, fill out information about them on the website, or create points on the map.
We are then able to use the service to invoice them every month.
Are you currently working on a full-time project?
It takes us a lot of work, but we have it normally at work, so that we can support the project and develop it.
There is no strong multinational investor behind us, we are two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other jumped in with other impulses and ideas.
Now we are looking for an investor strong enough to manage not the Czech market with us, but who should, with the exception of the ball, go with us to the global product and become another huge player in the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The plot of Titanfall 2 is to bring almost forgotten variety.
This will fix the second part and the solo game in it will be more varied than in Call of Duty, according to the first information.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling should be based on the concept of network engagement in the first part.
Therefore, you can look forward to freedom of movement, which, in addition to running, also includes the ability to use the combat titan.
In addition to action passages, the game will contain levels focused on skillful movement.
They will resemble platformers and include puzzles.
Therefore, to overcome them, for example, double jumps, running on the walls and a rope slide are essential.
Sometimes enemies will also have to be eliminated.
There will also be maps resembling mazes and levels with special concepts.
In one, for example, it will be possible to lift and slide the platforms and close the massive doors.
You will adjust the shape of the battlefield.
The pace of the game should thus oscillate between a furious action and quieter moments for exploring an unknown planet.
We're going to play footman Jack Cooper, dreaming of a career as a pilot.
At the beginning of the campaign, Cooper and Captain Lastimosa crash on the alien planet Typhon, which is inhabited by enemy soldiers.
Nor will the wilderness be kind to him.
In addition, Lastimosa is mortally wounded in the crash, and Cooper is tasked with operating the captain's titan.
His dream of a career as a pilot will come true sooner than he expected.
The first step, however, will be to steal the battery necessary for the robot's repair.
Cooper's conversations with the Titan will also be significant.
It will serve as a source of information about the soldier’s past, but at the same time, humorous moments will be created by robot-personalized communication.
For example, if the titanium will dryly list all the injuries that Cooper threatens during the planned jump.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 was brought by the server Polygon.
In addition, the result will be possible to judge in two months and Bonusweb will bring you the first impressions of the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 will be released on October 28th for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand will come to life, but the original label remains dead.
The Swedish company Nordic is changing its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of THQ in 2013, it acquired a number of its brands and the right to use the logo and the company name.
Nordic has released Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition and Red Faction Collection.
In addition, 23 more games are being created for the publishing house, and 13 of them have not yet been revealed by the company.
Thirty years ago, at the time of my retirement, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found a man twenty years younger, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - first she obviously tried for a long time, then they got together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because she's been dating someone like that in front of me.
She's completely lost her mind about him.
In those early days, her voice even changed, she had such a girlish, in love voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
I watched the whole thing.
He used to come home from work at 3:30 a.m., so she always left at 3 a.m. to go shopping.
Every day she tried to at least see him.
Later I found out that they were meeting at his house, in the laundry room.
How many times did I know they were there?
I got the keys, he was determined to catch them there.
I don’t know why, but I always stayed home.
I've never been able to go in there, take that decisive step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe that my wife controlled me mentally.
I think she soon found out that I was manageable, that I was going to do what she wanted.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just a piece of work.
My neighbors told me that they knew about it too.
I was so stupid, I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all broke, it would be bad.
That it would affect everyone in the family, only the daughter suspected something.
So I always put it off, go on and on.
But one day I went to his apartment to see if I needed help with anything in the laundry room.
He went there with me, and I told him that I got an anonymous tip, that he was seeing my wife, and that it was all there.
I asked him what he would tell me.
He stood there, shrugging his shoulders, looking at the ground without saying a word.
Then I also met his wife on the way out of the store at the time.
I told her, but she didn't believe it.
She didn't respond, and she didn't tell me anything.
No one told me anything at the time.
I'm the kind of person who's never been anywhere, who's having trouble getting to know someone, let alone finding a woman.
I didn’t even think about divorce.
I always hoped it would end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her and life would go on.
It wasn't like that.
And I've basically never dealt with it.
I still have it in me to this day.
I used to tell her that a lot, but eventually I let it go.
He's still living in the next house, and I'm still living with her.
It's just it's more like my wife's my housekeeper.
At home, she always did everything - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's hard-working.
She always tried to give me no other reason to complain.
And you could say she's kind.
But sometimes I want to caress her, hug her, and she won't let go.
We go for walks and shopping together and everyone thinks what a happy marriage we have.
But she once told me that she never loved me.
That she loved me and she loved me, but she didn't love me.
And I can see that she still loves him to this day, he's her god.
And I'm sick of living like this.
Even when it started and I had a very bad reaction to it, I once told her that I didn’t want to live and asked what she would say to it if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she would agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: Yes or no.
But she thought about it and finally said, "But there's plenty of room here."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to set up a new French Islamic foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
After the terrorist attacks, France is stepping up its fight against radical Islamists and the government and the local Muslim minority are calling for help.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will become increasingly difficult for France to guarantee the freedom of their religion," Valls said.
He wants to ensure that only spiritual people in France can preach in the country.
He also wants to stop funding mosques from abroad, where preachers indoctrinated with jihad often come with money.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to set up a new French Islamic foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by then-Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Even then, it was supposed to contribute to the transparency of financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
Soon, however, she was struck by internal contradictions, and therefore never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," Valls said.
The new foundation is likely to be headed by former Interior and Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chev<0xC3><0xA8>nement, who is known as a supporter of the secular state.
There are about 2,500 mosques and prayer houses in France, about 120 of which serve radical Islamism.
Since 2012, French authorities have expelled some 80 Islamic clerics from the country and are considering doing so for several dozen others.
This week, German police also intervened against jihadist clerics.
The Imams reportedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated a space where believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked a Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate broke out in France over a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation.
All this was accelerated by other terrorist attacks carried out in the name of the Islamic State by radical Islamists.
The new foundation will have two main tasks – to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also to supervise imams.
However, it is not yet clear where the funding will come from, although several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee for halal food, i.e. mainly meat derived from slaughter according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by halal food vendors for granting permits.
Part of the money would then go to the foundation's budget.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Each year, about 30,000 people leave France for a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
Moreover, in French mosques, only preachers who have gone through educational programs at the universities there should be present.
As a result, their preaching should be in harmony with democracy.
The government is also closing down radical mosques.
"We have closed 20 of them since December and more will follow," Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.
“There is no place in France for those who preach hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men,” he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was seriously injured by an unknown gunman Friday morning at a shopping mall in northern Spain's Zaragoza, the Independent reported.
The shooting occurred after a woman and her daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in the car in front of the shopping center, from where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun against himself, writes the Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital by an uninjured daughter, an ambulance had to come for the man in critical condition.
The attack took place around 11 a.m. in the central part of the capital of the autonomous region of Aragon, near the local university.
With reference to the Spanish agency Europa Press writes the Independent that the motive was probably the unresolved recent divorce of both partners.
Rolls with asparagus, wakame algae, ginger and chilli sauce.
Summer wishes light, well-digestible meals, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our own tastes and our own head.
And so from the summer gardens there is a smell of grilled necks, pork knuckles, pork knuckles.
Nothing too healthy, nothing too light, even sometimes with the exception of salad or baked vegetables.
True, grilling is time-saving and dishes, moreover, it is a social affair and no one needs to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to make good delicacies, which special dining, their preparation is a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to cook anything for a long time, bake, fry or stew.
They will also contribute to our health.
Whether it's homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality ingredients and a few well-learned griffins are enough to make the preparation fun and the food itself a real exotic treat.
As well as even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
It also eliminates the time-consuming cooking and cooling of rice.
The paper can only be softened into water for a moment, and then it depends only on the imagination of the chef, how he intends to play with the fillings and accessories.
There's no algae like algae.
The advantage of many dishes of Asian cuisine today is that raw materials are usually already available.
Including pickled sweet and sour ginger, which is one of the basic delicacies accompanying sushi or fresh roll.
You can also make it at home, but the true pink gari ginger has a unique spicy spicy and at the same time delicious taste thanks to the secret recipe, according to which it is mixed from several types of vinegar and ginger.
It is enough to buy a bag of the appropriate size, and the attachment with proven antibacterial effects, supporting digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are mainly used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and decorating dishes as part of a variety of festive occasions and rituals.
Long ribbed banana leaves are widely distributed in many countries of Asia and South America also as a "helper" for the preparation of a variety of baked, cooked and fried dishes, which are packaged in them like in an aluminum foil.
The banana leaf then conveys a specific flavor to the dish.
Here you can buy in stores with exotic fruits and vegetables, even pre-cut in the shape of wheels.
But choose only the leaves of a rich green, and therefore healthy - uncracked and without stains.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare a salad from wakame algae, sesame and sesame oil.
You can buy it frozen again.
Those who often eat or prepare sushi will probably know the nori algae in particular.
In Japan, it is one of the most important types of seaweed, from which it is made by chopping, pressing and drying the so-called nori leaves - plates intended for the production of sushi.
Wakame <0xE2><0x88><0x92> a dark green algae growing in the waters around Hokkaid<0xC5><0x8D> Island <0xE2><0x88><0x92> is also fresh and dried and is as popular as nori.
By the way, who would not know miso soup with wakame, supposedly Asian women use it since ancient times for recovery after childbirth.
And in general, this lash has almost miraculous effects.
It cleanses the blood, strengthens blood circulation, even supposedly prevents graying of hair and is literally loaded with minerals.
Dried and crushed wakame also serves as a spice, for example, to flavor rice.
Fresh lashes are first allowed to leach in water, then rinsed, put in boiling water and boiled for half a minute.
It is then cooled in icy water, cut out with the central ribs and further adjusted, perhaps as a favorite salad.
However, buying it ready-made, frozen, is the easiest solution.
It remains only to wrap the roll with an easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a long-term bomb.
If you resist and do not throw extra grilled bacon.
Eat healthy, light and summery.
Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a little dexterity, and you have an interesting fresh dish that deliciously combines flavors.
And it's done once or twice.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g of carrots, 40 g of white radish, 100 g of green asparagus, 60 g of lettuce cucumber, 60 g of wakame algae and 60 g of sweet chilli sauce.
A handful of chopped coriander, a teaspoon of black sesame, a teaspoon of sriracha chilli sauce, 20 g of mango and 40 g of pickled gari ginger, a little pine nuts.
First, we prepare the rolls.
Soak the rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we take it out and wait for it to soften.
In the meantime, cook the asparagus sprouts in hot water for a short time, after about three minutes, let them cool quickly in ice water so that they do not lose their color.
Put the vegetable filling on the allowed paper and wrap it.
Prepare the filling from white radish, carrots and salad cucumber, cut into fine noodles, mix them with sweet chilli sauce, add chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and put on rice paper.
Put the asparagus shoots on the banana leaf, add the rolls and at the end decorate the whole dish with wakame algae, pickled ginger, sliced mango, sprinkle with black sesame seeds and add a couple of pine nuts.
Britain must settle for silver in seven-point rugby, Fiji's choice takes gold
Great Britain's impressive performance in seven-game rugby ended in a devastating trail on the last hurdle, Fiji defeated the British in the final match on Thursday night at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio high 43:7.
The Fijians taught a masterful lesson in processing, landfilling, deflection, supporting play, line running, and brute force – and won gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with an unprecedented price of consolation in the form of a silver medal - Britain's third on the day - and the British could be proud of their performance in the inaugural Olympic seven-game rugby tournament, defeating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A hard-fought win over South Africans 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day may have frozen in the finals.
However, Fiji in its form would beat even the 15-member team in full health.
It will probably not be a consolation for the British, but they can rejoice in the fact that at least one of them will have a gold medal around their neck tomorrow: the main coach of the Fijians is Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
Great Britain has come a long way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens.
They lost the only one.
This defeat hurts, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji began magnificently, the penetrations of the British reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and the other team-mates, it was like running behind a row of buses in motion, and the World Cup champions led 5-0 when Oseo Kolinisau emerged from the corner.
The timer showed four minutes, and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing, from which there was a conversion.
12-0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The great Mitchell tried to stop the huge Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring a third time, but only the Fijians slowed down.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua threw the touchdown into the right corner and the British lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another one upon his return, and there was still more than a minute left on the clock... of the first half.
Vatemo Ravouva then penetrated the battered British and landed on the line, where he scored.
The 29-0 conversion was followed by a break.
It was as if Fiji had been born for rugby 7s while the British were still learning to pass.
That's the way it is.
The British made massive changes after the half-time and stopped the Fijian onslaught... for a full four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until after the brilliant interplay of Fiji Josua Tuisova, he broke through.
Dan Norton tried to get a chance for the British, threw a touchdown in the left corner to raise the an 36:7. But the match was won long ago by the inhabitants of the Pacific Islands and their fans at the stands sang, waved flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire the Fijians' totally overjoyed attitude.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame further attempt to win the Fijians sweetened.
A whistle sounded, the Fijians embraced, and the British fell flat on the lawn.
Earlier that day, Fiji defeated Japan 20–5 in the semifinals and the United Kingdom defeated South Africa in the close semifinals by a single conversion margin.
Kyle Brown took the South Africans to the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dazzling footwork, broke through the defensive line and scored in the second half under the hook.
Marcus Watson, Anthony’s brother from England’s 15th team, secured the victory – and eventually the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win rowing race inspired coach's fight against cancer
On these Games you will not find more emotional gold - and that's what to say.
From the first shot to the last, during the 220 punitive breaths into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another meaning in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Although there were two people sitting at the oars, there were three voices in the boat. When the ship swung across the water to meet the second Olympic gold in a row in the women's doubles race, the voice of the still-present coach Robin Williams was still with them on the boat. They are the first women in the history of British sport to achieve such a result.
Their superiority was absolute, overall it was their 39th race in which they remained unbeaten.
What we see - two excellent athletes flying across the water with the elegance of a swan - does not reflect the nature of victory completely.
Behind every gold medal in rowing is a battalion of helping hands that make a difference bit by bit, and no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago didn't know if he would live to see that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it was uncertain.
I suffered from bladder cancer that can be operated on, and I underwent this operation.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
This will change your view of the matter somewhat.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
The good news for the whole trio was that he could have started treatment in early 2014, out of season, and thus reduce the outage to a minimum - if we can call it that in such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together fast.
That was the impulse.
I was in the hospital and walking around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at the time they said a few steps were enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but this was a bit more challenging.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts were of Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, speaking less than usual as he tried to manage his own uneasiness.
Stanning, captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment, which is on a mission in Aghanistan, said: “I’ve been down with emotions this week, maybe it’s a little extreme, but it means so much.”
Again, it underscores how much it means to me, how much Helen and I have worked together, and so has Robin.
It's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin so far.
Without Robin, we wouldn’t be anybody, so thank you very much, he’s the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have asked for a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning did not lose a single race in five years.
The pair set a stunning rhythm that their rivals could not match.
Even in the final 500 meters, when crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We focused as much as possible at this point.
Helen screamed, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we did not want to achieve something famous.
We weren’t looking forward to today’s fireworks, we just wanted to row well, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a year to decide what to do next.
Glover is getting married next week, and her future husband is TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it would be my last race.
That would be too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to find out that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel much better about it," she said.

Prison?
Rather, let them take people for free, says taxicab hunter Rube<0xC5><0xA1> to a landmark indictment.
Six taxi drivers and a former magistrate in Prague have been charged, according to the Czech News Agency.
You have made a number of reports in which you have exposed fraudulent practices and those who are supposed to be in the group that will stand trial.
Because of this, you faced several unpleasant confrontations with exposed actors.
How important is the report on the indictment of the members of the organized group to you?
I thought there might be a trial.
I'm mostly curious about the verdict.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
It's no use.
They should return all the stolen money.
And they should give them back so that they can take all the people for free.
This is a rather peculiar solution.
Does this mean that you do not see the punishment as effective enough?
For me, it's enough that some of them are so afraid that they don't do the job anymore.
For example, one makes a ping, another distributes pizza, and one completely gave up on it.
In theory, the defendants could be sentenced to two to eight years in prison.
Do you think this is an adequate rate?
In general, I have a problem with imprisonment.
I consider it a bad punishment.
To put someone in prison, especially in this case, is nonsense.
Such people should bring back the companies they took from her.
For a quarter of a century, they have done this by destroying our country’s name and stealing from its people.
So let's make a good business card and get people out for free.
I can't imagine anything else.
It would work as a community service.
As someone goes to collect garbage, they would get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they'll get parole eventually, and they won't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Miroslav Ond<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek Film Academy in P<0xC3><0xAD>sek and subsequently at the Tomas Bata University in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n.
It belongs to people who started with viral videos and videos directly for the web in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for the internet television Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of programs, now he is preparing the Prague Guide show, which is intended primarily for foreign viewers.
Rube<0xC5><0xA1> advises those in the form of short reports which services to avoid in Prague and which, on the contrary, he recommends using without fear.
Previously, he filmed a series with the titles How to, City of Fraud?, Life in Luxury, And Enough! and Prague vs. Money.
The prosecution refers to them as an organized group.
The police followed her for several months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be described as mafia-like?
They're such cute mobsters, not the kind we know from The Godfather.
It's more like mobsters - juniors, but they're definitely organized.
It’s just that they watch each other’s stalls (taxi stations).
Prague is completely divided.
I found out that, for example, the main railway station does not like Parizska, Parizska does not like taxi drivers waiting at Karlovy Lázn<0xC4><0x9B> (disco club)
Everyone just watches their place, and every group is somehow organized.
It seems to be a complex network.
Only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former city hall official warned the driver of the checks.
As you say yourself, the undesirable phenomenon has not disappeared from the streets.
What percentage of Prague’s taxi fraudsters, according to your estimation, are they?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst ones on the street are still there.
I am talking about Ale<0xC5><0xA1> Ryá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, for example.
This is a man who is really dangerous - he carries a telescopic baton in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands at Charles Bridge and carries people.
The last time I went with him, he asked me for seven hundred in three kilometers.
The police did not arrest him for some reason.
Only a few people from the whole group chose.
The same is true of other locations in Prague.
Thus, the indictment of seven people will be difficult to eradicate the already famous Prague slum, which apparently has a much larger dimension.
Of course, it's no use at all.
It will help, but all evil will not be eradicated, that's true.
Do taxi drivers who rob foreign tourists still perform at the same places you showed in the reports, i.e. at Charles Bridge or Pa<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>ská Street?
Yes, that's right.
They're standing in these locations every day, and they're breaking ordinances every day.
It is ignored by both the city police and the Prague City Hall.
It's not even cats anymore, it's total indifference.
The business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
However, some of them, even if they are only part of the group, will be brought to justice.
It's a breakthrough.
So I have to ask: do you feel satisfied?
If I took it as a satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is and always will be to improve the center of Prague.
And even if I feel that I need to do a little better, I will continue to do so.
It is necessary to push on the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief stays, we should still do something to remove him.
You can't settle for that.
But that’s not the case, of course, there are more.
Are you still trying to confront them in taxis?
Sometimes I do test drives and I have to say it's still bad.
Just last week I caught a taxi driver, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 crowns for three kilometers, although then claimed that it was the amount of 56 crowns (using a trick with a decimal point).
He had a receipt, the police came, and this taxi driver was so cutely impertinent that he still went to the police and asked them when someone would finally give him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver on the taximeter overlaid the decimal point and robbed tourists of 357 crowns.
Can you say that the impertinence of the fraudulent taxi drivers did not subside even after you showed in your footage the faces of those who charged meaningless amounts for a short ride?
Their insolence is still incredible.
What happened to the taxi driver who claimed 56 crowns?
The police sent him away, saying they could not discuss the matter with him on the spot because he had issued a receipt.
And that, I think, will be a problem even in this court (six taxi drivers and one ex-official).
On one side there's a cab driver with his receipts, on the other side there's the police.
However, according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the municipality may not use secret recordings from the taxi service vehicle as evidence in court.
When I was filming parts about their frauds, the taxi drivers themselves drew my attention to this precedent.
I've always wanted to use it only for reporting.
Are you concerned that this fact could also protect them in court?
I hope that every judge will understand that no taxi driver could ride for six or ten crowns per kilometer, because he would not make a living from it.
You talked about a trick with a decimal point, which underwater taxi drivers move especially in front of foreign clients.
Is it still up to date, or are they afraid to continue using this trick after the publication of your reports?
I think we popularized this trick by broadcasting the show.
I was riding with a cab driver recently, and he bragged to me that he was the honest cab driver.
But then I noticed a black cardboard taped to the side of the taximeter.
When I asked him what it was, he said, "You know what it is."
If fines didn’t work too well for taxi drivers-fraudsters, can they be alerted by a court with their colleagues?
Is there anything that can stop them from cheating?
You talked about how you think they'll always find a way to cheat.
I don't think anything can deter them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are the fair taxi drivers who should be fighting harder to get them out of there.
From my experience, I must say that the fair taxi drivers in Prague, fortunately, prevail.
But do they want to go against those who spoil the reputation of their services?
They have taste, but they lack intellect.
He can't walk around much, and he can't say exactly what he wants.
When they held the demonstration (due to a proposal for a nationwide restriction coming from the office of Mayor Adriana Krná<0xC4><0x8D>ová), it was not very clear what they really wanted.
They once said they didn’t protest against Uber, they just wanted the same conditions as Uber, and then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It turned out that they just blocked Prague and it turned out to be only the best possible advertisement for Uber.
How do you assess the approach of the Prague City Hall in solving the problem of over-priced fares?
It is obvious that only the criminal police had to get involved in order to solve something.
The mayor was short on that.
They had a mole who was carrying out the information, which meant that the taxi department had been doing its job for several years in vain.
I hope they charge that official until the last check, all the failed checks to make him realize what he's done.
I think that's the worst part.
I even went with him on a control trip, which I found out only later from their schedule.
It has been several months since the last episodes of the series were released.
What's the response?
I think especially with foreign viewers, which is what the series is most focused on.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I play them the videos.
And when we walk around the Old Town Square, they are surprised that the same people who are seen in the pictures really stand there.
Infamous Prague celebrities.
Seriously, though.
I'd put a fence around them for people to look at.
Museum of Communism on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a taxi when you need to?
Oh, right.
I drive with services where I do not have to pay in cash, but by card.
I use services such as Uber or Liftago, where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also many dispatchers who are fair.
I've only taken a cab once on the street since.
The driver said to me after getting into the car, "Well, you've got a lot of guts."
I'm dressed as an Italian tourist.
Fraudulent taxi drivers were reported as early as 2005.
In the same year, the former mayor Pavel Bém went on a control trip in disguise as an Italian tourist and at the first attempt the driver cheated him by two hundred.
But Rube<0xC5><0xA1> had worse experiences.
Taxi drivers charged him 820 crowns for a ride from Starom<0xC4><0x9B>stsk<0xC3><0xBD> to Wenceslas Square, which comes out to about 195 crowns per kilometer, as calculated by the creators of the reportages.
The Prague City Hall has set a maximum price of CZK 28 per kilometre.
There are also other surprising sums in the reportage: for example, a two-kilometer journey from Pa<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>ská Street to Truhlá<0xC5><0x99>ská Street cost a tourist 400 crowns.
Taxi drivers waiting at the Charles Bridge also provided expensive rides.
For a ride on the Andel, which has 2.5 kilometers, they charge even six hundred crowns.
Marble is washed mostly with clean water, as much as possible without chemicals and the longer the better.
Impurities go well out of it, although sometimes the dirt must be put down with a scalpel, it must be hollowed out from the folds.
It is not easy and it does not go quickly, the restorer Vanesa Trostová from Old<0xC5><0x99>ichov in Háj<0xC3><0xAD>ch approached her work.
Hat down in front of it: the tombstone is surrounded by scaffolding, after which it is necessary to climb up and down countless times.
"The restaurateur should be careful, patient and undemanding to the working environment," she said.
This is far from her first restoration work in the Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant region.
Thanks to it, the stone elements of the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade in the back tract of the Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant Town Hall were restored, as well as the statues of St. Mary Magdalene in Záti<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>, St. John of Nepomuk in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant, Piet in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant <0xCC><0x81>s Okru<0xC5><0xBE>n<0xC3><0xAD> Street, Marian Column in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant, and the atlantes in the front of the Novém Spa.
The restoration of the tombstone of Melchior, Kry<0xC5><0xA1>tof and Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina of Redern began in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleaned of dirt and crust, the loose stone parts are secured against fall and displacement; they will either be anchored to the wall or to each other.
There is also a treatment and conservation of the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb are gilded again.
"Then it will begin with the gilding of the inscriptions on the marble slabs with pure gold leaf," said V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Sobotová, a representative of the State Monument Service of the Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant City Office.
There is no record from the past that the tombstone has undergone any repairs.
At a closer look, they capture the holes drilled in the marble columns.
They are hundreds of years old and are the remains after the decoration of the tombstone.
It was richly decorated, unfortunately after the invasion of the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War, everything disappeared.
They literally scratched the headstone, said Saturday.
In the Church of the Finding of the Holy Cross there are restaurateurs with a slight exaggeration like at home.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to put in order the tombstones that were underwater, the baptismal font was restored, wall paintings in the tomb and now the tombstone.
"We would also like to go into stained glass in the future," Sobota said.
The church is otherwise in very good condition, every year we put money into maintenance and repairs.
Restoration work on the restoration of the Redernov tombstone will cost a total of 128,000 crowns.
They will be covered by subsidies, the city will not invest any of its money in this part of the restoration.
One hundred thousand crowns will come from winning the regional round of the Historical City of the Year 2015 competition, the remaining 28 thousand crowns is the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, said Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant Mayor Dan Ramzer.
The decision to release the winnings for the restoration of the tombstone was made by the council.
Opinions of experts on the future development in selected foreign markets monitored through indices and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) in the horizon of one and a half months.
There is low volatility and growth in the markets.
Who would have said that at the beginning of the year?
The US S&P500 index, which went through a 12% correction in February, is now at a new historical high and has accrued 7% since the beginning of the year.
This reaffirms the iron rule that long-term traders should never go against the interest of central banks, which in the end have always achieved their goal.
With U.S. stocks at an all-time high, volatility is once again on the decline, which is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets were growing happily and fearlessly thanks to the quantitative easing of the U.S. central bank and when, as today, the volatility index (VIX) was stable below 12 percent.
And I don't either.
Although the Fed continues to prepare for a gradual increase in interest rates, quantitative easing in Europe and Japan is in full swing, and last week the Bank of England, which will buy 70 billion pounds of bonds in the next six months, also joined the effort.
The new wave of quantitative easing pushes already low yields even lower and contributes to the almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
That is, of course, the million-dollar question.
But there are no risks in sight at the moment, the world economy is undergoing almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation on the commodity market and in China is stabilizing, and Brexit is basically no longer a topic, so we should probably not be too surprised if US stocks continue to hold up in a similarly calm regime.
It's a pity that Juncker doesn't study Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has taken on this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult job, said Juncker, when he appointed the French politician (really experienced, because he had been rubbed out by so many different supranational political functions that it would be difficult to find a better example of the so-called European elite) as the European Commission’s chief negotiator on the terms of the UK’s departure from the EU.
Juncker’s choice has garnered signs of hope that it is in the EU’s serious interest to seek with Britain a form of future friendly co-existence.
However, most of the British media accepted Barnier’s name as an act of war by Juncker.
Barnier is a rock federalist.
They hate the UK.
As European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was responsible for the reform of European banking law.
He conceived it as only he could: a staunch enemy of the Anglo-Saxon conception of the free market and the model of capitalism.
An advocate of multilateral regulation, he co-authored the concept of the so-called banking union and, with a grudge against everything that comes from the City of London’s financial centre, pushed through legislation overly rigid regulations on the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in a dispute with London, will be a tough, unyielding and apparently ruthless negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
In this context, how can we not remember the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which the balance, overview and empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus contributed so much.
Even today, Czechs and Slovaks can be close friends and allies.
It is a pity that Juncker did not learn from Václav Klaus - at least in this one -.
It would be for the good of all!
Earthquakes around Putin?
The ruler of the Kremlin released his close Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday dismissed Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the presidential office.
Anton Vajno will take his place.
This was reported by the Russian media with reference to the announcement of the press service of the Kremlin.
Putin said he was releasing Ivanov at his own request.
At a meeting broadcast by Rossiya 24, the president said he was responding to Ivanov’s wishes when he took office that he wanted to be the president’s chief of staff for a maximum of four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The report on the exchange at the head of the presidential administration, which will now be led by Ivanov’s former deputy Vajno, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, 63, is considered one of Putin’s closest associates.
This former KGB officer, for example, has held the posts of defense minister and deputy prime minister in the past.
He will now also leave the chair of the president's security council.
Ivanov, however, during a meeting with Putin, said that the length of the stay at the head of the administration of the head of state is actually a record.
It lasted four years and eight months.
In this regard, he recalled that in the 25 years since its establishment, 11 people have already been replaced in this function.
Kvitová and Deblisty Uncle and <0xC5><0xA0>afá<0xC5><0x99>ová will not play the finals.
So far, none of Friday's tennis matches have been able to turn into the finals.
Petra Kvitová was the first to lose her fight, succumbing to the Puerto Rican surprise of Monica Puig after sets 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
After a while, Kvitová was followed by Czech singers <0xC5><0xA0>afá<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>vá and Str<0xC3><0xBD>cová.
The Williams sisters' slayers, although they reached for the win in the first set, missed two sets, and the Russians eventually won the set in a shortened game.
The second set lost by a ratio of 4:6.
Half-success in the morning program in Rio was recorded by Czech rowing: skifarer Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Synek won his semifinals with an overview, when he defeated the second Damir Martin from Croatia despite slowing down in the end by almost a second.
Today good, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as possible, said the son.
His opponents, unlike him, had to fight for progress.
So it took them some strength, so it could be easier tomorrow.
But I’m not saying it’s going to be easy, it’s just playing cards with me, said the rower of Prague’s Dukla.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková, however, did not follow in Snyk's footsteps.
The 35-year-old rower took fourth place in the semifinals today and will start in the B final on Saturday and fight for 7th to 12th place.
London's not the way to defend gold.
It was the first time I didn’t make it to the Olympics.
I’m a little bit sorry, but on the other hand, I was driving a quality race and I put everything I could into it.
The opponents were simply better, Topinkova Knapkova bowed before them.
She fought until the end and believed that in her fourth games she would be among the elite six.
He gave up just before the goal.
I knew that the girls were balanced, that anyone could advance from that field.
I was surprised that the Chinese woman had such a finish.
And I thought I could make it through the Austrians to the final.
Unfortunately, today was the race of a lifetime, said the world champion of 2011.
Far behind the final gates in Rio remained a young shooter Filip Nepejchal, who even for the second time failed to break out of the qualification, this time a small rifle lying.
Nepejchal took the 33rd place.
The qualification was the best for the Russians.
From the first place, Sergey Kamensky advanced with 629 points, from the second, Kirill Grigoryan (628,9).
Nepeichal's shot was worth 620.5 points.
Athletes also spoke at the program in Rio for the first time, among them Czech seven-timers Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Cachová and Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Klu<0xC4><0x8D>inová.
Cachová ranks eleventh after the second discipline of the Olympic competition, Czech record holder Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Klu<0xC4><0x8D>inová is twenty-second.
British Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimeters, as well as the second Belgian Nafissatou Thiam.
Both took care of the historically best high-altitude performance in the heptathlon.
They tried to jump 201 centimeters, but failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
Apart from the absurdity of the question: German society has undergone a profound self-reflection, while Russian society has not.
In both of the great Eurasian nations, dictators occurred in the 20th century, and regimes came to power that were inhumane, brutal, and terrible.
From 1917 to 1989, the Russian Bolsheviks contributed greatly to the 94 million victims of communism listed in the Black Book of Communism, whether they were daily individual repressions, targeted famines, incompetent warfare, or inhuman experiments.
The Nazis inhumanly exterminated about 6 million Jews, and the total number of victims of the Second World War is estimated at 60 million.
In the occupied or abandoned territories, atrocities were carried out by the Germans and the Soviets.
In Germany and in the USSR, only a few individuals were guilty, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes either actively, passively or only by cowardice or by sticking their heads in the sand.
This is not only the specifics of these nations, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany, the immediate end of the war came the denazification, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important thing came later.
When the children grew up, they began to ask: “Daddy, grandfather, why did you participate in such atrocities?”
How could you do that?
This has brought real reflection and healing to society.
Until recently, the German elites were mainly concerned with the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they certainly do not want to rejoin Alsace-Lorraine or to attack someone - for revenge - militarily - everyone will admit that.
After the defeat of the Cold War in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of possible positive changes closed definitively at the turn of the millennium, when former KGB officer (sic!) Vladimir Putin came to power.
The criminal past is often celebrated in Russia today.
The policy of Putin’s Russia is revenge, conquest of lost territories, humiliation of the West.
The health, prosperity and future of their own people is of no value to the top brass.
Beat your own, and strangers will fear.
I still believe that it is only those decades of despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior – destined for Asian (self) tyranny.
Who is benefiting from the rising tensions around Crimea?
The Ukrainian Army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the region of Crimea has worsened.
Who benefits from rising tensions?
After a long period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia have deteriorated again.
The pretext of the Ukrainian side became the peninsula of Crimea, which was annexed to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
Of course, reports from both sides contradict each other and are difficult to independently verify, so we only have the opportunity to think about the old familiar question of who benefits from this?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on the Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which, of course, Ukraine rejects and, conversely, accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
Information about the arrest of members of the Ukrainian special forces on the territory of Russia came from the case of the pilot Savchenko known response that they were allegedly abducted on the territory of Russia.
If we were to accept the Ukrainian version, how would Russia benefit from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only hurt Russia, mainly by the West in the form of further strengthening of sanctions and strengthening of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, against the background of the immigration crisis in Europe, there has been a retreat from the situation in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian leadership has already lost all credit to its residents, with President Poroshenko’s current support hovering around 15%.
Ukraine’s economy would have been bankrupt long ago had it not been for generous financial injections from the EU and, above all, the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime once again needs to draw attention to its country in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation before the voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the security forces once again want to show themselves as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia.
It is to be hoped that all those who are trying to start an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only the soldiers, but of all ordinary people on both sides and stop their hostile actions in time.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest level in several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero level since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The annual average rate of inflation, measured by the CPI, over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous period of 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, so monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 there was an increase in the travel of these groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
At the same level as the previous month, prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education remained.
The U.S. intelligence services have been tracking Russian hacking attacks for a year.
Information about the Russian attacks came to the public last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was investigating an attack on the servers of the Democratic Party headquarters.
There is no official report of Russian involvement in the attack.
Moscow denied involvement in the attack.
The report on the surveillance of the alleged Russian attack was top secret because its disclosure would reveal that US intelligence services were monitoring the hacking and could reveal how they were doing it and what resources they were using.
The attack was reportedly carried out by two Russian intelligence services.
New Advisory Board for Cybersecurity
The material on tracking the Russian trail was encrypted and had access to it by only a small group of experts, Reuters reported.
Of the public officials, only a small group of eight leading members of Congress, known in the U.S. as the Gang of Eight, were informed.
It is made up of the chiefs of both chambers, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the chairmen of the Democrats in both chambers, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of the congressional defense and security committees.
Democratic Party chief Donna Brazile announced Thursday that she is creating a cyber security advisory board to “prevent future attacks and ensure first-class protection for Democratic Party servers.”
There was a dangerous parasite in the smoked salmon from Albert.
The chain apologized.
Based on the consumer’s suggestion of health problems after eating the food Wild smoked salmon - pieces of 100 g, the date of consumption 22.11.2016, Prague hygienists carried out a check in Albert stores on Wenceslas Square and Na M<0xC5><0xAF>stku.
The inspection found that the batch L23012562/T4 with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, which the customer pointed out, is no longer available and therefore the product of the same batch with the date of consumption 11.12.2016 was removed.
Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
This is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammals.
This is dangerous for humans - larvae in the body cavity or muscle of fish are a strong allergen and human-eaten live larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into internal organs, said <0xC5><0xA0>ticha.
We apologize to our customers for the problems with this branded product.
We immediately withdrew the mentioned batch from sale and, for preventive reasons, we also withdrew all other batches of this item.
There was a mistake on the part of the supplier we are dealing with, and at the same time we had this product tested ourselves, spokeswoman Alberta Barbora Vanko told Novinky.
If the customer has purchased this product, he can return it at any of the chain stores and get his money back.
Larvae will destroy the frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was the company Nekton - Vr<0xC5><0x88>ata.
The hygiene experts informed the Prague and Central Bohemian Veterinary Administration about the occurrence of the dangerous product.
According to the bezbeznostpotravin.cz server, people after ingesting the parasite can get anisakiosis, which manifests itself with severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can occur without symptoms, the Czech News Agency said.
Symptoms appear an hour to two weeks after consuming insufficiently heat-treated infected fish.
After three weeks from the onset of the disease, the larvae usually spontaneously leave the digestive tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to high and low temperatures, so they are killed either by sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or by freezing it.
Veterinarians have now checked the salmon with the recipient of imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples tested had parasites in them.
The shipment of 1,700 products came to the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) at the beginning of April.
Dispatched, in the vast majority to the Ahold chain, was to date 919 packages.
Unsold stocks of the product are currently being withdrawn from stores, SVS spokesman Petr Pejchal said on Friday.
Veterinarians immediately after finding positive samples banned the sending of other products from the warehouse.
A 17-year-old British woman wanted to escape from Raqqa, apparently killed by a Russian airstrike.
After initial enthusiasm and a quick marriage to the jihadist, who was soon killed, sobering came.
The expected paradise of the caliphate for British girls turned into hell on earth, from which there was no escape.
According to relatives, the girl was in contact with her sister Halima.
She called him repeatedly and told him she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape from Alcatraz.
They are ordered to shoot indiscriminately, according to Tasnim Akunjee, a lawyer for the family of the deceased girl.
The last clues led to Raqqa, from where the girl spoke for the last time.
Then came the news of her death, which cannot be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in East London.
They discussed how they could get out of Raqqa and cross the Turkish border.
There, they hoped to meet the former student again.
But Kadiza was likely killed before she could escape because the house she was staying in had been razed to the ground by a raid in May, British ITV News reported.
The TV channel added that the bomb was apparently dropped by a Russian plane that attacked the IS bastion in Syria.
You would take the blue from the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, a family lawyer.
In the week when (Kadiza) was thinking about escaping Islamic State territory, an Austrian woman was caught trying to escape and, according to available information, she was publicly beaten to death.
I think she interpreted it as a warning and decided not to take risks, according to BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana, along with 15-year-old school friends Shamima Begum and Amira Abasova, set out on a trip on February 17 last year.
All they said at home was that they were going out.
But they headed for Gatwick Airport and from there through Turkey to ISIS-controlled territory.
According to the lawyer, the girl’s family did everything in their power to get Kadiza back.
You would take the blue out of the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, and this family did everything they could, strained their strength to get their daughter home.
But it was not possible without risking being caught, the lawyer added.
The only positive is that the fate of Kadiza can serve as a deterrent case for other girls or even boys who are fooled by Islamist propaganda.
“There are many cases where people went there, realized how things were there, understood how different it was from the Islamic State’s propaganda promises, and wanted to come back,” Akunjee said.
The fate of Kadiza's classmates is unknown.
But since they have also fallen silent, their families have to accept that they are most likely dead.
To jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries, the village of Inveraray was the regional center and seat of the Duke of Argyll.
From the middle of the 18th century, courts were held in the town hall and the basement under the hall served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the prisoners lived were deplorable, and many prisoners attempted to escape.
Many of them successfully.
Therefore, the city representatives decided to move the premises of the prison to a new place.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more welcoming to prisoners, with heating and gas lighting.
It was closed for economic reasons at the end of August 1889, as smaller corrective devices were expensive to operate and did not pay much.
Prisoner stories and ghost hunts.
The prison opened to the public a century later, visitors can compare the old building with the new one to see for themselves how different the conditions were.
Guides in period costumes enhance the authentic experience.
There is also a torture chamber where visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to criminals, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be locked up in one of the cells, usually for a souvenir photo, or to evoke the feeling that prisoners experience behind bars.
Additionally, Inveraray Prison is one of Scotland’s most famous haunts.
Several groups of hunters of paranormal activities have already set out there, and to this day the museum allows people to come to hunt some ghosts.
Such a night, however, will cost 300 pounds, which is approximately 9,500 crowns.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the village also attracts with its great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
Snapchat’s ‘animated’ effect is criticized as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say that it is racially insensitive.
Every day, Snapchat allows some 150 million users to change reality and play with identity in ways that border on absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that seems to come out of the picture of Roy Lichtenstein.
Filters are simple tools that distort reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies every day.
Any errors will be posted immediately.
Snapchat’s filters have received criticism in the past, accusing the app of promoting blackfacing or promoting white skin tones as an ideal of beauty.
So when she offered users a filter this week that gave them slanted eyes, crooked teeth and bloated faces, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians — “yellowface.”
And they asked if these recurring contentious questions did not point to a larger problem of society - the problem of diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and news and outrage quickly spread, and Snapchat announced the very next day that it had canceled the function.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as an expression of accounts to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asians.
But to observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded painful stereotypes in action.
Others flatly refused to compare it to the anime.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student from Korea whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was “at least harmful and embarrassing.”
She added that “it’s hard to argue against comparing the obvious Asian caricature and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not only about the yellow face (yellowface), but that the yellow face is drawn to a disdainful extreme.
Snapchat isn’t the only company to cross these cultural boundaries.
American culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the facilities we all carry around.
And the sheer number of young people on Snapchat — who are more racially diverse than their older partners — may mean that even greater sensitivity can be expected.
“When one Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to some users,” said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview Thursday, “it’s just very hard to do these things without being noticed today, as it was before.”
Katie Zhu, a product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she was convinced that racially motivated issues reflected a lack of diversity in Snapchat’s hiring practices.
Katie Zhu criticized the company’s predominantly white, all-male leadership and ended the article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“It’s either that they don’t have any diversity among employees and people of color at the moment these things are being decided,” said Zhu, who is of Sino-American descent, “or people of color are working there, but not in positions to feel safe or comfortable to speak up.”
Other observers share her point of view — a complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures relating to the diversity of its employees, provided that it has the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of its employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a recruiter who should focus on underrepresented populations and internal inclusion management.
Zhu adds, “I’m curious if they really need more of those users who can say it’s not okay,” with their account remaining suspended.
Military Officers Distorted Intelligence on ISIS, Says Parliamentary Committee
The parliamentary committee said in a report released on Thursday that officers from the U.S. Central Command had altered intelligence reports to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events from the country provided.
According to a preliminary report by a working group compiled by the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Subcommittee on Defense, there has been “extensive dissatisfaction” among Central Intelligence analysts that their superiors have altered their assessment of America’s efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as CentCom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The report’s press release states: “The intelligence outputs endorsed by Centcom’s superior officers typically offered a more positive picture of U.S. counterterrorism efforts than has been confirmed by facts on the ground, and were consistently more positive than analyses obtained from other parts of the intelligence community.”
“What happened at Centcom is unacceptable — our fighters are damaged when superior policymakers are presented with a flawed analysis,” said Ken Calvert, a California congressman and Republican.
The failure of Centcom's leadership reaches to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report details the central staff’s persistent problems in describing and analyzing U.S. efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no conclusive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be amended, the report said analysts felt they had been pressured by Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by the Islamic State, or IS.
“In the first half of 2015, many of the Central Staff’s press releases, statements and congressional testimony were substantially more positive than what actually happened,” the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military attack to take Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
“This is clear after months of investigation,” said Rep. Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, top U.S. Central Command intelligence officials manipulated the staff’s intelligence outputs to downplay the dangers of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans formed a task force after learning of analysts’ concerns that intelligence information related to the Islamic State group was being manipulated.
The report, released on Thursday, must be followed by further investigation.
In the intelligence services of Centcom, another investigation led by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defense is underway.
On Thursday, Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings, which corresponded to some of the findings of the Republican task force.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a very narrow process for compiling assessments of information on ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, chairman of the committee and a Democratic representative.
According to Adam Schiff, this process "led to a distortion of intelligence outputs," damaged morale among analysts, and "did not sufficiently take into account dissenting views."
However, Schiff and the Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions based on "a template or a political situation."
Preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on the ongoing investigation by the Pentagon’s inspector general, which was launched following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the parliamentary report as the Inspector General’s investigation is still ongoing.
But he noted that “experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these critical national security issues.”
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the U.S.-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement now being made by a growing number of defense officials).
However, last year’s accusations raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the Central Staff to honestly assess military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis locations.
Criticism of news coverage of the Islamic State has reflected conflicts for more than a decade, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper stating that the George W. Bush administration - despite the objections of many analysts - defended a small unit in Iraq and devoted little time to thinking about it in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in the resistance against the intelligence services of the Islamic State.
Last year, authorities reported that Hooker’s team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, the air strikes conducted against Islamic State refineries did not significantly weaken the terrorist group’s financial resources, as the group built temporary refineries and sold oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings had not been passed on outside the headquarters.
The commander of Centcom, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticized last year after many lawmakers found the Senate’s testimony too positive an assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced at Centcom by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States won the field hockey in the fourth game in a row, so today will play a decisive match in the team of Great Britain
In a 6-1 win against Japan, Katie Bam scored three goals, and the day after she scored the first two goals of the match against Japan, where the U.S. defeated India 3-0 on Thursday.
Five goals in two games is a success worth remembering, but Bam, 27, said she was not sure if she had ever done it.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those people who writes down their goals.
But he knows this: the Americans at the Olympic tournament lead the games 4:0 and share the first place in the group with Great Britain, which remained on Thursday after the defeat of Japan 2:0 remained undefeated.
Britain and the United States will face each other in the final game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams qualified for the quarterfinals and the match will decide which of the group of six teams will finish first and which will finish second.
The team from the first place will avoid strong Danes who are at the head of the second group for a little longer.
Whatever the outcome of Saturday’s game, the Americans caused a stir here with their surprise run, four years after they finished among the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on the team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first took up hockey when she was 3 years old (her older twin sisters played at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player ever.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she didn't make the final list.
Then came the year 2012 when neither she nor the members of her team did very well.
The next year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
In London, we didn’t have the pace of work we have today.
We've made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night Bamová started in the first half by shooting the goal with a backend from close range.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team proved to be surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third quarter, when Bam took advantage of the opportunity.
She escaped on the left side of the playing field, then looped into the center and shot the ball into the goal to get the Americans into the lead 2: 0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The elimination of American goaltender Jackie Briggs, who helped to one goal in each of the three wins, was the first in the tournament.
He's in great shape.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good place now," Parnham said, "but how good it is will depend on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Zen trampoline in the middle of the Olympic fury
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter what time it is - it's the Olympics.
From the events in Rio de Janeiro, one can feel the persistent, indescribable and biased alternation of competition and effort.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a hot relay pin handed from a gunner to a swimmer, a gymnast, and a triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in the coffee shop queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the animosity between Michael Phelps and Chad le Close.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming darling of women with dimples in their faces, is at the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names ring in households in the prime time between the ad and the sponsor spots if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, California, is competing for Olympic gold by jumping on a trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not shine in all competitions in the same way.
Far from the center, a little in the shade are sports that are not universally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have success in the classic swimming style - and will probably reign for a long time.
But if I may name my extraordinary favorite, let me draw attention to the inconspicuous charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it was first introduced at the Sydney Games, after 16 years of intervention, the sport remains almost unnoticed – many people I asked didn’t even know it was an Olympic sport.
It could be regional indifference.
The U.S. has never won a medal in trampoline jumping, and until 2012, none of the athletes made it to the finals.
Prices in the men's category are usually divided between China and Russia and in the women's category between China and Canada.
This year, the gold medals from London will be won by Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
Jumping on a trampoline has another bad luck, partly because the ear of the uninitiated will seem more suited to a clown university than to the Olympics.
I must admit that I am not an expert, but only an enthusiast following from the country.
It has comical potential - the comic vibrations of endless reflection - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it combines.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish "el trampoline", which means "jumping board."
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline, which shoots them to a height of almost 10 meters and perform sets with several elements (salts, screws and combinations) before they finally land on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated by design, difficulty and "time in the air".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is forward.
Gold medal fighters must go further, faster and higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
They are trying to catch up not only with the target tape or the starting wall, but, as the TV news reports, also with another imaginary line: the world or Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, admirable, a little fanatical - and enough to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it’s also a bit exhausting when you’re watching the Olympics.
Jumping on a trampoline in this regard brings relief.
The track athlete on the trampoline is up.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she reflects as if they were weightless like astronauts, flying up, then down, and then up again effortlessly.
Without competition and, of course, even difficulty, it is impossible, but for the duration of the assembly there is no furious struggle to achieve the goal, no measurement of distance, but only a perfect, graceful suspension of time and gravity.
This is just as close as the Olympics and Zen get.
The women's qualification and final takes place on Friday afternoon at 1 p.m., and the men's competition takes place on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will air the finals as part of an afternoon block that begins at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the middle of the Olympic madness, they promise quiet, pleasant moments, which you will probably overlook through other fights.
And if the only way to get attention is for male athletes to be the object of loving looks and materialization – as the US gymnasts recently suggested, according to the Wall Street Journal – then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to catch their breath.
"Protest generation" in Ethiopia, a longtime U.S. ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have met with violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say many protesters were shot dead during clashes with police.
Is there a threat of war in Ethiopia?
In the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
In recent months, however, the country has been gripped by anti-government unrest, which has spread to more and more areas.
In the past week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding major political changes.
Human rights groups say the government's response has been merciless.
Witnesses say police shot and killed scores of unarmed protesters.
Rounding video footage of the protests, likely from the end of last year or early this year, shows security forces beating young people with sticks after they were forced to stand against a wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It’s always been difficult to hold this country together and it’s going to be even harder to take a step forward,” Rashid Abdi, Horn of Africa project manager for the International Crisis Group, said in a statement.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence agencies are working closely with the Ethiopians to eliminate the threat of a terrorist attack in the region, particularly in Somalia, and few African countries, if any, are receiving such aid from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia has been developing at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically, with a new commuter train running in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
But Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - human rights organizations are constantly talking about government repression - opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were banished, imprisoned, killed, or driven far into the desert.
However, this may change.
“When you strangle people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a breakthrough,” said Seyoum Teshome, who teaches at the University of Central Ethiopia.
They are protesting all the youth.
A whole generation is protesting.
Complaints range from land disputes to absolute control of power by the ruling coalition.
After last year’s election, which was widely criticized, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat held by the opposition and now controls 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, pressure is mounting on the border with Eritrea, a conflict along this imprecisely marked, disputed border that has claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less suppressed over the past years, such as the Oromsk Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the confusion and re-arm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why now, after years of smoldering beneath the surface, these bitter feelings have flared up again.
The first one is seemingly harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks only in the last few years, when cheaper smartphones have become commonly available and the provision of Internet services has improved.
And even if the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as is usually the case, especially during protests, many people can still communicate through Internet proxies that hide the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they had gathered for the protests.
There is also greater solidarity between the Oroms and Amhars, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oroms and Amhars are not natural allies.
For centuries, the Amhars, mostly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, excelled in politics and commerce and used the Oroms, many of whom are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that's also changing.
"We are on our way to unified leadership," said Mulatu Gemechu, leader of the Oroms.
The largest protests took place in the areas inhabited by Amhara and Oroma.
Many Amhars and Oromians believe that Ethiopia is wrongly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and controls the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, a former rebel leader, served as Ethiopian prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he succumbed to an unspecified illness.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corner.
Analysts say he was particularly skilled at spotting initial signs of discontent and using envoys to work through opponents and win him over.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge," said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegin, was pulled out of relative obscurity with the aim of replacing Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the Tigray-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
Ethiopia last experienced such unrest in 2005 after thousands of people protested against what analysts described as elections that the government picked up and then stole.
This was followed by a severe crackdown, during which many protesters were killed - albeit less than in recent months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as a new commuter train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
However, it is quite clear that the gradual escalation of disputes within the Ethiopian government has not stopped.
And there is a dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in the Amharic city of Gondar attacked business firms owned by Tigrayans, and resentment against Tigrayans on social media has become more common.
Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently said the base had been closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally to disintegrate in an already volatile region.
"That," said Abdi, "is a very sharp edge of the blade."
Donald Trump Explains His Statement on Obama and ISIS Funding as ‘Sarcasm’
Donald J. Trump on Friday sought to downplay the latest controversy that is flooding his campaign by saying he didn’t mean it when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s ability to speak clearly to the American public.
He also puts his supporters, who defended him vigorously in stormy times, in an uncomfortable situation and must explain that he may not have meant his remarks seriously.
Following this suggestion at a meeting on Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he did not really intend to say that the president and Clinton created IS.
In a tweet on Friday morning, Trump said he was being sarcastic.
The post was the opposite of the old one-day claim, when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften the remark by reminding him that Obama was seeking to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate for president did not respond.
The latest storm comes as Trump has tried to focus his campaign’s attention on the economy as his preferences in election polls fall.
Trump and Clinton were in Michigan this week for a duel on economic issues.
On Friday, Trump returned to the issue.
On Twitter, he again warned that Clinton’s proposals were linked to tax increases, and said that some thought her speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm before.
At the end of July, when he drew a wave of criticism, when he proposed that the Russians should break into Clinton’s emails, he later explained his remark by saying, “Of course I’m being sarcastic.”
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and soften them as needed.
“I think it’s his way of testing the extent to which some of the messages have a response from his supporters to see how they react, and according to the response then one way or the other, ‘give an explanation,’” said Ruth Sherman, a communications specialist who tracked the language used by both candidates.
But I also think that he is skillful in his statements and he knows that they are vague enough to be explained in different ways.
As election results continue to fall in his favor, Trump has chosen an even more stingy tone in recent days, instead of making things easier for the general electorate.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released on Friday showed that Tump is a long way behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and very close behind her in Florida.
Trump tries to avoid making excuses for the provocative remarks he makes, but often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump faces increased scrutiny in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have put his devoted supporters, who must publicly stand behind him, however provocative his remarks, in an uncomfortable situation.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City who is one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate extensively in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
“I think what he’s saying is a legitimate political commentary,” Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded Islamic State.
That's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization that he mistakenly called a novice, and it happened because he withdrew his troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to flourish and failed to aggressively handle the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of Friday’s rallies in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to fire on the media on Twitter for reciting his every word and being biased against him.
He laughed at the “poor, pathetic” TV scholars who were trying to understand him and said, “They can’t!”
Several Democrats grinned at Trump’s apology, saying it was just further evidence that he was unfit for the presidency.
Cafe pushed out of the market prices. Now he returns to Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a shabby place in Williamsburg where you could only pay in cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee had been served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - the store that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
Locals lamented it as the last loss of a sprawling city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe CBGB is dead, the Chelsea hotel is looted and the Verb is now a soap store.”
But if New York is a change, then it is also a rediscovery.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and accepts credit cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee is also good.
The manager of the new Verbu is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the original cafe, who is also the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started at Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When one of the customers offered to pay for the move, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same supplier of pastries and bought the same model of espresso machine.
He even re-used the lighting from the old Verbu.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
Sandwiches with ham, egg and cheese and toppings such as capers and fried onion are on offer.
You will also find bowls of brown rice.
The café no longer serves beer, but offers you fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of native regulars.
“Many of the original customers also had to move out of Williamsburg because of the prices,” he said.
Last Sunday, one of those customers was here, Rebecca Oliveir.
Mrs. Oliveir, 34, lived in Williamsburg and frequented Verb Cafe.
It happened even after the cafe moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee altogether for a while.
"I found that what I like is coffee and Verbo culture," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, but on that day, instead of her usual iced coffee, she gave herself mixed chai, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-time customer, has been loyal to Verbu since 2003.
He goes to work and always orders the same thing.
"At quarter past eight every day, like clockwork, I'll come here and they'll make me a bun with everything and butter," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually does, but sometimes he puts bacon, eggs and ham on his bun with everything.
Rodriguez said he wasn't sorry that the soap shop had taken his old place.
The truth is that the owners of Soap Cherie offered him to make a special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the cafe as an ingredient.
"I think we could still use it," Rodriguez said.
The traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint also accepted the cafe well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish and Rodriguez said that he wanted to find a place where he would soon put it so that his new neighbors would feel at home here.
The new place has other advantages.
The local fruit juice producer wants to bottle and sell filtered coffee.
There is an opportunity for the café to expand into the neighbouring building.
Many customers just need to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the cafe closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the café reopens, going in and having coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depression food from the crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after taking office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and ate lunch.
President Roosevelt enjoyed a selection of dishes from 5th Avenue, such as goose liver pate and Maryland turtle soup.
But his menu for the day was more modest: devilish eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and plum pudding as a dessert.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, is dedicated to gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe’s latest book, Chop Suey, was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane’s book, 97 Orchard, tells the life story of an apartment building on the Lower East Side through food.
Harper’s new book, “A Square Meal,” is a history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed their culinary solidarity and met the reporter for dinner at Eisenberg’s sandwich shop, a small, austere buffet in the Flatiron district, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, Andrew (57) had turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meatball, which the couple said was a good fit to talk about food during the crisis.
"The meatballs were very popular," said Miss Ziegelman.
Peanut, liver and bean meatballs were sold.
They were made from that admixture and other cheap foods that set the ingredients.
Imagine the amount of peanuts you would have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe grinned.
"They'd be in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served in the form of a buffet of what you eat.
Teams of women cooked for the farm workers, and freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. “A Square Meal” follows the ways in which the nation coped with the fact that it was suddenly not a land of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Equally feared was the new budget diet: mysterious dishes like meatballs and pans, pans as a “wonderful way to use leftovers,” Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unsightly ingredients under a layer of creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - for many years the focal point of American food - has become an economically allotted luxury.
Strange mixtures, which were supposed to serve as a caloric and nutritional filling, took precedence over taste or even common sense when cooking.
During the surveys for the recipe book, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a favorite addition to the dinner table," Andrew Coe said.
Jane Ziegelman said, “It was surreal.”
Peanut butter with roasted onions does not go together.
It was typical for a lot of homemade recipes.
As never before, and never after, domestic economists—among them Louise Stanley, the sherry of the Federal Office of the Home Economy from 1923 to 1943—managed the country’s eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, urged women to take over the reins of the budget, and turned treats like creamy spaghetti with carrots into tasty meals.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.
First of all, desserts were created in response of the government to its hungry citizens, such as the pose of President Herbert Hoover “I’ll have a cake”.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his childhood, he was dining as the select millionaire he had become.
“He liked to eat continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce,” said Andrew Coe.
He was eating in an almost gilded room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn’t made him set an example with his own stomach.
As the book recounts, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in taste at all, which led to the White House “not only serving almost the most disgusting meal in all of Washington, but also the most inconsolable way prepared.”
Many of the eating habits of the crisis period subsided as soon as the country was back on its feet.
The link remained in our constant exploration of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple says that while writing the book, they had a better understanding of Ms. Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits—perhaps why she couldn’t throw away the food.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "People were sick of her."
There's been an accident with the wreaths.
When Eisenberg had clean tables, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: a plum dessert that President Roosevelt had eaten for lunch.
"It's called plum cream," Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, just plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly tucked the spoon into the thick brown mass.
Surprisingly, it was bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as a good householder, he said to his wife, "A little chopped walnuts would be good."
Europeans: Migrants go for benefits.
Most of the refugees who come to Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
This is what the show would look like if we did it.
A group of Russian artists calling themselves 2D Among Us are making fun of their home country.
Using Photoshop, he creates collages that funnyly show what it would look like if famous TV shows and movies were shot in Russia.
Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of the costs of legal representation in the case of a patent against jaundice type C against the Merck concern
A district court judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimbursement of attorney fees it incurred in the patent lawsuit against the drugmaker Merck & Co.
In June, Gilead was ordered to pay $200 million in damages for violating two of Merck’s patents in connection with Gilead’s highly successful drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a federal judge found repeated wrongdoing on Merck’s part, including lying under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman said in a filing Thursday that Gilead is entitled to a waiver of fees incurred in connection with representing in the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for next-generation drugs against hepatitis C, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed to own basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s drugs.
U.S.-backed troops say they have gained full control of Manbij
U.S.-backed troops have gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the border with Turkey after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now scouring the city after the rest of the group of radicals who were hiding in the city have left.
The troops freed more than 2,000 civilians detained by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and the Manbij military council told Reuters.
“The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching,” he told Reuters.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return, which states that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earned $10.75 million that year and paid a real tax of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, Clinton was given $1 million in charity, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Bill Clinton contributed nearly $5.3 million to the joint coffers for lectures, and the former Secretary of State granted $3 million in income from Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure.
The Clintons co-candidate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, have published tax returns for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a real tax of 20.3%.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be role models for financial transparency,” said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton campaign.
On the contrary, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and backs away from his earlier promises to make his tax returns public.
It is customary for candidates for President of the United States to publish their tax returns, even if the law does not require them to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers cited an audit by the U.S. Treasury Department’s tax department as the reason for his refusal to release tax returns.
“Your move,” Hillary Clinton’s campaign aide said on Twitter, referring to the Democratic nominee’s tax returns.
Michael Cohen, Trump’s special adviser, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to make his tax returns public until the audits were completed.
According to Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, his rejection raises questions about his net profit, charitable contributions, business transactions, and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has a strong stance on the issue, posting a video on Friday reminding Republicans of how high-profile they are urging Trump to make his tax returns public.
On Thursday, the question will be mentioned in his speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"She refuses to do what all the other presidential candidates have done for decades - publish their tax returns," she said.
Politico said Trump had paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and a New York Times columnist quoted a number of tax advisers and accountants as saying that may still be the case today.
Federal tax rates became a topic in the election of the president.
Clinton is pushing for a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett that would ensure that anyone making more than $1 million a year pays a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
Last week, Buffett at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, home to Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, called on Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been audited by the IRS and that Trump was “not afraid” of the tax office, but of voters.
Clinton's campaign published tax returns retroactively until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average of 32 percent federal tax and a combined tax of about 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
The Clintons’ tax return for 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, they make only $100 in their income.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual-index fund, from which the Clintons reported income on dividends and interest of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chilli or fireworks to protect elephants in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania are using an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from walking into human habitations — throwing condoms filled with chilli powder at them.
The Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes this procedure and trains volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use this non-violent four-step procedure to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Many of them had previously used lances to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since they developed this ... toolkit, we’ve seen a change in behavior in these communities. People are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them,” said Damian Bell, executive director of the Honeyguide Foundation, in a statement.
The first and second steps are to light a flashlight on the passing elephant and start the horn.
If this does not prevent it, the so-called “chili cloud” will be thrown away.
Chilli powder mixed with salt is wrapped in a condom along with the firecracker, its end is knotted so that only the wick looks at it.
After detonation, the condom explodes and a fine chilli powder is sprayed into the air.
Usually, one whiff is enough and the elephant goes in a different direction.
The last option is to detonate the fireworks, which will cause a loud, bright explosion.
A Jewish director leaned against a Berlin hotel for removing the code for calls to Israel at the “request” of Arabs - RT News
A French film director of Jewish origin has caused a stir in the media after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not include a code for calls to Israel, according to an employee based on the “request” of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary “Shoah,” vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the hotel's code list.
However, the state was not listed among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and deleted?
Written by Lanzmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol instead offers the possibility of calling to Israel through its own call center.
The director looked for an explanation and turned to the reception desk of the hotel with a problem.
The answer he received, Lanzmann said, “shocked.”
The hotel staff responded that the measure had been “decided at the discretion of the management of Kempinski Hotels.”
The reason for this move made the director even more indignant.
“Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that the Israeli call code be erased,” Lanzmann said in a letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, described the case as a “great shame.”
We were horrified and shocked by the events.
That in itself is a huge shame.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany, and even in such a hotel chain, is even more shameful.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event sparked a strong online reaction, with people calling it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel was simply “lost” in the demands of Arab customers.
“Shame on you,” says another post, which points out that the hotel, located on the noble Kurfurstendamm street, is located near the synagogue.
According to Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly dropped any charges, calling the event an "overlook" and apologizing to Lanzman.
“No direct order has ever been issued” not to include Israel in the call code list, the Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski representative as saying.
He adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
The clash between students and police took place in San Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday, as students gathered for a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The problem escalated when the government security services tried to disperse the students, which ended with the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals by the governor of the state of San Paulo, Gerald Alckmin, to save money is also the closure of almost a hundred public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the protesters could be seen spray-painting signs on the wall against interim President Michel Temer.
The latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse in support of ousted President Dilma Rousseff when the country's Senate decided to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan, after the lifting of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran, trade turnover increased by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
According to the ambassador, since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies that trade in the country.
Russian companies are restoring existing ties with Iran, while new firms are poised to enter the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran grew by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015, reaching $856 million.
Specifically, Russia’s exports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The surge in trade was ensured by the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of tourists from Iran to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mostly travel visas.
For the first time, Iran was among the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists coming to Russia.
It is safe to say that the record number of tourists from Iran to Russia last year will be surpassed," he said.
At the same time, however, a relatively small number of Russians are visiting Iran, and the ambassador hopes that there will be a change.
"I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are in good condition," he said.
Scott Callum Skinner is heading home after the British won gold in cycling
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the Hall of Fame last night in the men's team sprint at the Rio Velodrome, when the trio of the UK team defended the title from London 2012.
The 23-year-old native of Glasgow was in the role of the brake he took for his Scott Sir Chris Hoy, and the young man delighted the legend by crashing into the finish line and stealing the victory from the hands of favoured New Zealand.
Britain won the gold medal four years ago and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after finishing a modest sixth in the track cycling world championship in March, even though Hoy had ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement for the specialized opening racer Jamie Staff.
Hinds then appeared just in time.
After Hoye's departure, the place that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill also became vacant.
Skinner was a man of British coaching, and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes – who was champion with Hoy four years ago – and Skinner reached the Olympic record in qualifying, but took the jersey in the first round New Zealand.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind on his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner kept the lead.
A change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes going for a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to keep up the pace.
Hoy watched the race from his position as a BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes stepped onto the stage, he kept his eyes on them.
The 23-year-old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said: “It’s a flattering comparison.”
I'm here to get the best out of myself and honor my name.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the best.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After triumphing alongside Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he had crashed on the track after a weak start.
He later retracted the remark, and Britain's rivals had no opportunity to appeal.
There was no such problem this time around.
Hindes said, "With all the British flags in the stands, I felt like I was in London."
Over the past three months, we've all come together as a team.
We have lost in many world races, so winning the Olympics again is simply amazing.
It is one event, one gold medal for a nation that has won seven of the ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then a successful five days are waiting for us at the velodrome.
With the form Kenny has shown, it is not inconceivable that he would repeat Hoy’s success and win three gold medals at one Olympics at the same time.
That would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, also has a birthday on March 23 (this date seems to be sacred for British sport, on this day also celebrates the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - a total of six gold and one silver medal.
Same as Hoy got.
Next up, Kenny will take part in the sprint, which starts today and will last for another three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: “I’m enjoying this one now.
Team racing is always the best.
You win along with others.
To be honest, winning for yourself is a bit lonely.
Hindes said, “If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted.”
That was the only medal race of the day, but there was still good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest team in the four-kilometre race.
They finished with a time of 3:51,943.
The world record, which was set in London in 2012, is 3:51,659.
The first round and final (22:42) take place on the second day of the race, which Wiggins will certainly focus on.
Yesterday, before the qualifying race, he was debating with the commissioners when the referees asked him to measure the height.
In a similar women’s race that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie set a world record with a time of 4:13.260.
The VB team relied on its strong track cycling team and dominated the middle period of the Olympic Games and won a lot of medals.
After a truly exceptional performance, showing complete superiority in Beijing and London, expectations decreased during the preparations for Rio.
Dramatic events unfolded in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April due to allegations of sexism and discrimination, and the end of the career of greats such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of racing at the Velodrome, it seems that the legendary reputation that the UK team can deliver top performance with perfect timing could be reasserted.
The uncertain future of Portland’s smelter after the end of the energy supply contract
The future of the Portland aluminum smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power plant that supplies the company with electricity and which informed one of the owners of the smelter of the intention to terminate the contract for the supply of electricity. All contracts for the supply of electricity are expected to be shortened.
The move comes after Victoria’s government decided earlier this year not to extend subsidies that keep the business running.
The fixed 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa Portland.
Up to 2000 jobs - direct or indirect - may be at risk when closed.
And because the smelter consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity production, more avalanche impacts can occur.
Alcoa closed the Point Henry plant in 2014, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's distillery in Portland is run-of-the-mill and in danger of closing.
The move follows years of speculation about the company’s future, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and more recently over the plant’s production prices.
The AGL, which supplies electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects one of the other three owners to also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, a small business is held by the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp.
“AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, in other words, that the demand for electricity from the melting plant will continue,” she said.
The AGL said the contracts were so-called “security contracts” that were due to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually expire in 2017.
“AGL continues to anticipate that the contracts will contribute to the profits for the fiscal year 2017,” the plant said.
Any potential impact on AGL profits from fiscal year 2018 onwards is currently limited by the strong outlook of the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL said it has already written contracts worth $187 million under its books “in case there is a termination.”
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contract “has no impact on its ... ability to operate a smelter or secure the supply of electricity to the smelter.”
The company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to take effect in November, although it has yet to explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are very cautious about the possible closure of the Portland distillery in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the sector.
AGL operations manager Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts earlier this week, said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity a year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both of these companies withdraw from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in market demand [electricity].
It would not be good for us as a producer," he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the Kardashians' reality TV show - now she's the cover of September's Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and the fourth daughter of the mother-manager of the clan Kris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the cover of the September issue of the American Vogue magazine.
Kendall, the brand ambassador for Estee Lauder, who performed at the fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
“In a room full of people I love, I want to cry when I look at this front page,” Kendall wrote.
The unveiling of the front page was followed by a bizarre (or simply a continuation of the Kardashians’ humor?) staged video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (the barbarian rioters Rob and Caitly, and with them all, their favorite uncle from show business, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest, was able to take part in the show.
It’s the edgy storyline of almost every “birthday” episode of a children’s television show (Seacrest says, “Did you think we’d forgotten about you?” with the candor of a cartoon rabbit on the show at eight o’clock in the morning), but somehow Kris needed to make sure the other girls could make a living at this publicity.
Because when we look at the September issue of Vogue, we're definitely entering a new era of the Kardashians.
Older sister Kim may have pushed Kendall on the cover of Vogue (she was on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the title of the September issue of the magazine is a different league.
The September issue of Vogue is the best-selling issue of the year.
The edition, which resembles a book for advertising purposes rather than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionista calculated that there were 615 pages with advertising content out of 832 pages in last year’s edition).
The unveiling of the star, which will appear on the front page, is eagerly awaited, so it’s no wonder that in the past two years, the magazine’s images have leaked even before its official publication.
Among the women who have appeared on the cover in the past are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have certainly been more “celebrities making models” on the front page than “celebrities making models.”
Jennifer Lawrence, the Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador, appeared on the cover in 2013, a year later she had the honor of Laga Gaga.
But while it’s highly unlikely that Kendall — whom the magazine describes as the “breakthrough model” of her generation — will fall into the first category, she’ll be in very good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, nor the stars of real estate shows, or the children of today who know how to make a well-edited video (although Jenner represents all this).
They are proven talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the cover last year, had one of the strongest years of her career thanks to the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is enthusiastic about Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult due to her participation in a reality show.
Stephanie Seymore, the original Victoria’s Secret model, criticized Jenner and her co-star Gigi Hadid in June and called them “whores of the moment.”
These feelings flared up again with the news that Jenner would appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this disaffection is out of place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of September's Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
He's performing for Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's make-up.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She's selling photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter she took for Love magazine.
And in his spare time, he appears in a reality show, perhaps only as one of the ways to see Kourtney and her children.
Community Legal Aid Centers Reject 160,000 People Annually
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable citizens are rejected every year in community legal aid centres, and in the sector itself they are preparing for the impacts that will have further financial constraints on already overburdened services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and people without the financial means to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already rejected when they are looking for free legal aid and representation.
Community legal services, which are already so strained to crack, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal aid centers will lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Community Legal Aid Centers, said the latest summary report from the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centers found that 5,000 people are rejected each year.
Mr Farrell said that without the repeal of the federal government's decision, the situation would deteriorate.
“Queensland Community Legal Aid Centers are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are denied the vital services they need,” he said.
People who have escaped abusive relationships, people with excessive and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly dismissed - all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, leading to thousands more Queenslanders at risk having to navigate complex legal issues without help.
We call on the Attorney General and Senator of Queensland, George Brandis, to immediately prevent this funding cut, so that people can get the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
Over the past year, the government has met its commitment to provide funding for legal aid up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community legal aid centers and the community of their clients, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
The lawsuit against the campaign of Donald trump after a member of the staff allegedly pointed a gun
NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump’s campaign has been sued for alleged inaction after being told that the director of operations in North Carolina pointed a gun at a crew member while driving a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a court filing that was handed down Wednesday by Vincent Bordini, a former software campaign manager in the state, at the state court in Charlotte.
Bordini said he had waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before concluding that “it will not happen.”
Director Earl Phillip "pointed his fingers at the gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pointed the barrel at Vincent's tailbone," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
According to the file, Bordini found after a complaint with the local and regional campaign leadership that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
"The weapons do not have to fire to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after a Republican presidential candidate caused a stir when he told voters in North Carolina that gun owners and gun owners (which is regulated in the U.S. by the Second Amendment) could step in if his rival, Hillary Clinton, is elected and can appoint her own judge.
Trump’s campaign says the media has taken his words out of context and that Trump has not defended the violence.
In the lawsuit, Bordini seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision and from Phillip for endangering personal safety, unlawful use of violence and causing emotional harm.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to get a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
The WCCB, a local news outlet in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
No one responded to a phone call to his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, within a short period of time.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is running a controversial election campaign.

Britain must continue to spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, Heathrow is hugely attractive, just as London 2012 was when we made an extraordinary effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions could benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympic Games were a huge benefit for both Startford and the East End.
And we will do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new teaching posts, 40,000 new jobs, and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just like before the London Olympics in 2012, there will be those who will think that the expansion of Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games and that we would be ridiculed on the world stage.
Doubters were wrong in 2012, and even in the case of Heathrow, it turns out that they were wrong.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer any question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and businesses, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion, and leave a legacy of skills and jobs both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have put in place an <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment programme on schedule and with a budget, starting with the T5 terminal – which has been voted the best terminal in the world for five years running, to the T2 terminal, which has been built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway worth <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion of private investment.
The London Games in 2012 were a huge success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will be one too.
It is time for us to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, secure trade for the future and leave a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Deputy Secretary of Commerce for the Department of the Treasury.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in a game of cat and mouse in ad blocking
Attempts to circumvent ad-blocking programs have turned online marketing companies into cat-and-mouse games, according to one of the companies that program such software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad filters on its desktop sites, Adblock Plus posted a post on its site stating that users can update filters in their program and block ads on the social network again.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop website will change the coding around ads to make it more difficult for ad filters to determine which parts of the page are advertising.
But Adblock now claims that the new codes have already been bypassed.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that “this sort of war between the open source ad-blocking community and those trying to circumvent it has been going on since ad-blocking was invented,” and that Facebook is likely to come up with another self-correction.
The fact that the company that owns the world’s largest social network got involved in the war only proves how big the problem of blocking ads for industry has become.
According to the study, Pagefair did the same thing last year, and Adobe uses about 200 million ad filters worldwide – almost four times as many as in 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook ad revenue, with 1.03 billion active users visiting Facebook from mobile devices every day.
The spokesperson said the company is, however, going against desktop ad filters because mobile ad filters on social media and Instagram mobile apps don’t work.
Desktop ads still represent a profit high enough for Facebook to decide to invest in.
Facebook also said on Tuesday it would update its ad preferences tool to give people more control over how their ads appear.
On Thursday, Facebook said the new Adblock filters worry them because they could also block content on the site that is not related to the ad.
“This is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to address this issue,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Ad blocking is an insensitive tool, so we’ve focused on building tools like Ad Preferences to give people control.
A woman was hit by a car on the Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to an incident in which a woman was hit by several cars on the highway on Thursday morning, apparently attempting to commit suicide.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
Police in Vaud said in a statement that the “desperate act” actor was lying in the dark on the road and was run over by several cars.
It is clear that the victim, a 49-year-old woman, wanted to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been questioned, but according to police, not all have yet been identified. The police are calling on these drivers and all others who witnessed the accident to report.
A criminal investigation was opened, a “logical” step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
It remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Could the collision have been prevented?
The prosecutor has to find out," Hofstetter said.
Based on two similar cases in the past five years, it appears that drivers will not be held liable.
In both cases - one of which involved a person walking on a highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of negligent manslaughter after she struck and killed a man on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on the night of August 2014.
The court heard that the victim had been drinking alcohol at the age of 22 and had passed out on the road.
The court found that the police officer — who responded to the emergency call — was driving in an appropriate manner and that the man’s presence on the road was a “completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday’s incident at Morges should contact the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
A tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies (ACCKA) expects that up to 20,000 visitors will come to Prague as part of the Prague Pride.
On Friday, the Executive Director of A<0xC4><0x8C>CKA Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Pet<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ková said.
The sixth year of Prague Pride began on August 8, the festival brings closer the life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people (LGBT).
Last year, about 35,000 people attended the event.
"Prague is one of the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, due to its high level of tolerance and a wide range of specialized businesses," Pet<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ková said.
According to a survey of organizers, foreign visitors to the festival spend an average of CZK 3,100 per person per day.
Special maps of Prague with a complete list of gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications are available to gay tourists to support their travel, etc.
“For tourism in general, the LGBT clientele is very lucrative, interested in staying in higher price ranges with a high standard of travel services and spending more than others,” Pet<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ková said.
As part of the festival program, the first Pride Tourism Symposium will be held this year.
Experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the USA and China will give a lecture.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also focus on several thematic areas, such as family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The highlight of the festival on Saturday will be the traditional parade with allegorical cars, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letná.
The march, attended by thousands of people in recent years, will mark a minute of silence this year in memory of the victims of the June attack at a nightclub in Orlando, where the gunman shot dead 49 people, mostly gays.
Pat and Mat celebrate 40 years.
Irresistible DIYers Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have been entertaining both small and large audiences for forty years.
The pilot part of this evening series directed by Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Bene<0xC5><0xA1> premiered on August 12, 1976.
The creation of this animated series, which is now known to viewers in more than a hundred countries of the world, was the cartoon jokes of the artist and director Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Bene<0xC5><0xA1>, which he invented for the magazine with two masters Ohol<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek and Sedlec.
Bene<0xC5><0xA1> then invited the playwright Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Kub<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek and the artist Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Jiránek to cooperate and together they created the film Kut'áci.
Today's appearance with yellow and red t-shirt and ball and radio broadcast was given to the characters in 1979, when the series for Slovak Television began to be created in the Short Film Prague.
Pat and Mat were named after them in 1985, this time for the short film Prague.
In 1990, Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Bene<0xC5><0xA1> founded his own animation studio AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other works were created.
After his death in 1995, other works with other artists continued, many of them with the participation of Bene<0xC5><0xA1>'s son Marek.
Currently, there are over ninety episodes with the stories of these DIYers, with whom everything is poured under their hands, but they never get angry with each other and are always full of optimism, ideas and DIY enthusiasm, and in the end they are satisfied with their work, which is evidenced by the well-known gesture "...and that's it!".
Pat and Mat have even moved from TV screens to books, to DVDs, to theaters, and the characters and other toys depicting Pat and Mata are a hit with every toy store.
A fairy tale for Fiji and for the two-year-old Harmony.
The end of the week is in the sign of fairy tales, we have chosen for you one sport and one from life.
Both have a good ending.
Let's have a look.
Fiji has achieved historic success.
What is the cause of the joy of the whole earth?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
What do people spend the most on at the airport?
This is Friday's review from the World Wide Web.
The first medal from the Olympic Games.
Historical success is celebrated by the island state of Fiji.
Rugby selection of this archipelago defeated the Great Britain team in the final of the Olympic tournament of seven rugby.
This is the first medal that Fiji has won at the Olympics.
It took sixty years for the first precious metal to be mined after the first Olympic Games.
Great credit goes to the coach of Fiji.
Ironically, it is Ben Ryan.
He has been leading the team since 2013 and after the final as a British citizen he could be satisfied, unlike his compatriots.
“Let’s play it easy and let’s see if we can make the biggest game in our history,” the coach said.
Fiji eventually took control of the country, and the tiny country of 900,000 people is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
The news was reported by the French daily Le Monde.
A new friend and happiness for a little girl.
Two-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been without arms and legs for 11 months, has a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," the two-year-old said, as her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take off her arms and legs and then sit together without prosthetics.
Harmony was diagnosed with type B meningitis in less than a year, and doctors gave her only a ten percent chance of survival.
There's nothing I don't love about her.
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's funny, and she never gives up.
It also has a view.
I saw her introduce herself to the other kids with the words "Hi, I'm Harmonie and I don't have hands," her mother added.
Look at the joy the doll has caused.
What do we spend the most on at the airport?
CNN reports that people spend the most on bottled water at airports.
The Hudson’s travel essential stores chain released data for the past year, which summarizes the 10 products customers buy most often at its stores at airports.
The water was the first.
Drinks were generally very popular, with eight in the top ten.
The ninth place was occupied by a large package of M&M candies with coconut flavor.
And can you guess who's closing the top ten?
As one of the above things you can not eat.
According to CNN, it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: The New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Magazines include US Weekly, In Touch, and The Economist.
Rowing sovereigns.
We're just going to win. They laughed at Murray and Bond.
New Zealand rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond have been reigning supreme in the bareboat category for seven years and have confirmed their dominance at the Rio Olympics.
At first glance, the disparate pair switched to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and has been crushing competition since 2009.
At the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon, they claimed their 69th win in a row in Thursday’s final.
How are we different from others?
We are simply prettier, Murray joked during the Olympic regatta, when he was supposed to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand pair.
To be honest, we don’t do anything different from others.
We're just training hard, very hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy," Murray said more seriously.
Their dominance is remarkable also because they are physically different.
Murray is almost two meters tall and a hundred-kilogram chasnik, academically looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
They also have a different nature.
Bond studies and deals with finances, Murray has a charity boxing match, for example.
They don't spend much time together outside of rowing, either.
Eric's getting on the boat basically saying we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I tend to think about what could go wrong, admitted Bond, who even at the press conference clearly demonstrated that Murray is the dominant one in the crew.
He was always the first to respond, and Bond was waiting for his chance.
On the water, however, the opponent destroys calm force.
They are going at their own pace, and although they are often not in the lead in the middle of the track, their opponents have not yet found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We race on a two-kilometer track and we never wanted to go the first kilometer on top of it.
We're just trying to go at a pace that no one else can.
“We know what we have to do to win,” said Murray, 34.
With his four-year-old partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007, when they were both members of the Golden Four without a helmsman.
It was after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later that they decided to move to the No. 2 without a helmsman.
At the Olympics in London, they probably made up for the biggest defeat of their career and confirmed their dominance in Rio.
London was intense.
“We did everything the coach told us and they didn’t ask questions.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it was going to be a hell of a lot harder, and we had to make sure we were mentally well, Murray said.
We all want to be dethroned from the throne.
We still have that target on our backs.
But we try to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model for studying Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions similar to those on Earth once existed on Venus, whose surface is hot, waterless, and saturated with CO2.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' low rotational speed can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But according to the latest simulations, Venus may have once boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere while spinning slowly.
The model also dealt with the earlier topography of Venus.
There may have been drier areas on the planet than on Earth, but there was once enough water and geographical diversity to rule life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus has also previously used the sun, which was 30 percent more subdued.
“In a simulation of the GISS model, Venus exposes its day side to the sun almost two months at a time during a slow rotation,” explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This heats the surface and creates rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds that act as an umbrella and protect the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are in fact slightly lower than those currently on Earth.
The model compiled a story of Venus similar to evolution, which was previously hypothetically compiled by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over several billion years -- it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated and water vapor was burned by ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen escaped, leaving only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of greenhouse gas -- that's Venus as we know it today.
The researchers published their results from the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy Resigns as Colorado Avalanche Coach
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche team, citing his inability to participate in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and said the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
“For the past three years, I have been the head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination,” Roy said in a statement.
Over the summer, I spent a long and intense time thinking about how I could improve the team, give it the depth it needs and take it to the next level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and the vice president of hockey operations be in line with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that have an impact on team performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who accepted Roye on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the league's best coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but Colorado faced Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs, and during the last two years, he always failed to win matches after the season.
The Avalanche team scored 39:39:4 in the 2015/2016 season and was five points short of a second wild card in the Western Conference.
Goalkeeper Roy, who had entered the Hall of Fame, had won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
Oil rig workers in the North Sea resume talks, end strike
The leaders of the two sides said strikes over wages for oil rig workers in the North Sea have been suspended, while all parties to the dispute have come together for a new round of negotiations.
Strikes against the oilfield services company Wood Group have occasionally taken place on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and the Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that they have agreed to resume the process to resolve current disagreements,” the statement said.
Starting next week, we will have a series of all-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at problems from new angles.
According to trade unions, their recent action, which they say was the first in more than 25 years, is up to 30 percent to protest wage cuts.
Wood Group has cut rates this year and paid out about 9 percent less to its North Sea suppliers due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in company rates comes after a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company argues that further cuts would give the company room to cope with the market downturn.
On the other hand, Shell has cut thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to exit oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries to modernise its processes – immediately after a mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low oil prices, the economic situation associated with the June decision of Britain to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disagreements of a generation that led to a strike in the North Sea.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the region's economy.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just some,” he said.
For comparison, nearly $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea in 2016, while the average over the past five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of stars in the Pleiades
The latest mission of the Kepler space telescope to help astronomers is to obtain an almost complete list of the rotational speeds of stars from the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, and how the rotation time is related to the formation of the planet.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between stellar mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Pleiades Cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in the cluster are now reaching adulthood and have formed over 125 million years ago.
Now it rotates the fastest.
At the moments of maximum rotational speeds, these adolescence stars release huge amounts of stellar wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
As the star ages, its rotational speed slows down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by measuring the time between the detection of recognisable points on stars -- like sunspots.
According to the latest data on rotational velocities, larger stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, the larger ones make pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades ballet, we see that the slower-rotating stars are more massive, while the ones that spin the fastest are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing star quality and rotational speeds.
"The Pleiades provide us with an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, in younger and older stars," Rebull said.
There’s still a lot we want to know about how, when and why stars slow down their rotational speed, so to speak, “hanging their dance shoes on a nail.”
Rebull and her colleagues detailed the latest analysis of Pleiades rotational speeds in three studies that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a Qualifying Agreement Necessary?
If I did not apply, then the qualification agreement would not be concluded and after a few months I could move to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work after graduation without applying to specialized education?
My point is that in the field in which I would like to work, there is now a vacancy only in a slightly more distant hospital, but in about half a year, a place in another, where I would like to work, could be freed up.
I do not know how to deal with the situation for about six months, the question continues.
Answered by Mgr. Lenka Vlková.
No legislation provides for the obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - hospital.
A qualification agreement is a legal institution regulated by the Labour Code and may be concluded between the employee and the employer in order to ensure the return of the costs incurred in increasing or deepening the qualification of the employee.
In the area of health, there is a long-standing pressure not to conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring the labour mobility of health workers, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Act No. 95/2004 Coll., on conditions for obtaining and recognition of professional competence and specialized competence for the medical profession of a doctor, dentist and pharmacist, it is expressly true that participation in specialized education is considered to be a deepening of qualifications (not an increase in it).
This means that a qualification agreement can only be concluded under the Labour Code if the costs are at least CZK 75,000.
No legal regulation even provides for the obligation to apply for specialized education.
The law only specifies the conditions for applying for inclusion in the field of specialized education.
However, according to the law, a doctor is entitled to practice the profession of a doctor already due to the completion of the necessary university studies, albeit under the conditions established by law (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialized competence in the relevant field).
The law foresees a situation in which professional experience completed in another field of specialization may be included in the specialist training of a doctor, if its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational program.
Theoretically, it would be possible to count the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the situation of the interviewer.
However, given that I do not know the circumstances of this case, it is advisable to consult the relevant department of the Ministry of Health (the Department of Science and Medical Professions), since the Ministry of Health by law provides advisory and consulting services related to the inclusion in special education and its course.
The advisory service is also provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, of which every doctor must be a member.
Doctors in Halab, Syria, are calling for U.S. intervention.
The United States made no effort to end the siege (insurgent areas of the city by government troops) and did not use its influence to enforce the protection of civilians, the White House said in a letter.
“We do not need tears, compassion, or even prayer; however, we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over eastern Halab to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab is not besieged again,” the doctors said.
Russian forces, which support an army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, have announced they will stop strikes in the Halab area every day for three hours from today to allow safe passage for humanitarian convoys.
From 9 a.m. to 12 p.m., all military activities, air strikes and artillery fire are to be stopped.
U.N. humanitarian chief Stephen O’Brien welcomed the move, but said a two-day truce was needed.
In the letter, 15 of the 35 doctors working in the eastern part of Halab, which is controlled by the rebels, addressed Obama, according to AFP.
He writes that during the five-year war they witnessed the violent, cruel death of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world is watching and noting how complex Syria is, but doing little to protect us.
Recent offers to evacuate residents from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like only slightly veiled threats, pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors said.
Doctors said there have been 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria in the past month, 15 of them on hospitals where they work.
The saddest part is that we have to decide who lives and who dies.
Young children come to the emergency room with such serious injuries that we have to choose among them those who are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we do not even have the necessary material to help them, doctors describe.
Two weeks ago, four newborns suffocated when an explosion cut off oxygen supplies to their incubators.
They were gasping for breath, and then their lives were over — before he could really begin, they recalled.
An army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russian forces, has encircled rebel-held eastern Halab in recent weeks, leaving more than 200,000 people without food supplies inside.
The rebels, who are under constant strikes by the Russian and Syrian air forces, managed to break through the encirclement after three weeks on Saturday and launch a counteroffensive.
Both sides were then reinforced in the city and its surroundings.
