In Kherson, people again went to the rally, the Russians did not have time to disperse
As told the agency the participants of the event, the Kherson residents had time to hold a rally before the place arrived to disperse the military of the Russian Federation with equipment.
“We managed to hold a rally. Now the equipment of the Russian Federation has arrived there,” said one of the participants of the event.
Previously, the townspeople traditionally gathered for protests in Freedom Square - near the building of the Regional State Administration and Regional Council.
This area, like the building, is currently controlled by armed Russian troops, who use weapons against protesters and kidnap people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As Ukrinform reported, residents of Donetsk regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military is using force and weapons against people, are wounded and detained.
Also, Russian invaders kidnap residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded Kherson with a special title "Hero City".
February 24, the President of the Russian Federation Putin began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure, massively shelling residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple rocket launchers and ballistic missiles.

Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war, it will stop fighting – we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that the battles for the east of Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war – and if the Armed Forces of Ukraine are defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and re-occupy the de-occupied territories.
“Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war for today.
We fight, we fight, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (the defenders of the city – ed.) – people who pulled away a large number of the enemy.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (district) of the JFO, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer for us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, then we can not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to a return even to those cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for that too.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we state.
We believe in our result, in our victory.”
Zelensky also said that it is difficult to negotiate after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we should not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution, if we have them."
“People will accept peace anyway, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, on the conditions of independence of Ukraine, but ... every family has lost something – and I do not think that they will be satisfied with any peace on any terms.
But if we don’t speak emotionally, the war must end in peace, or it will end in millions of casualties.
And even where there are a million victims, everything comes to an end.
Yes, we must fight – but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing left, there's no people."

In connection with the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts were needed to describe its new qualitative state.
The analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state
Ukrainian poetic metaphor in contemporary literature allows us to analyze the postmodern context as such, where the metaphor plays the role of an axiological criterion.

The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has published a list of Russian servicemen who participated in the commission of war crimes in Bucha, Kyiv region.
As Ukrinform reports, this is reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine in Facebook.
“Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine has obtained a list of servicemen of the 64th separate motorized rifle brigade directly involved in the commission of war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Bucha.
The MOU DIU notes that for the crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine, all war criminals will be brought to justice and will be brought to justice.
You can view the list at the link.
As Ukrinform reported, Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the entire Kyiv region were liberated from Russian invaders.
In the liberated cities and villages, mass killings of civilians by Russian military were recorded.
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoly Fedoruk, reported that 280 people were buried in mass graves.
Prosecutor General Iryna Venedyktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were removed from the territory of the Kiev region liberated from Russian invaders.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Troops of Russian invaders shell and destroy key infrastructure facilities, carry out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple rocket launchers, ballistic missiles, and air bombs.

We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
It was great , I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouc area does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal abuse of civilians north of Kiev.
Photographs of tortured and shot people have embarrassed the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people are questioning each other, how could this happen in the 21st century?! How?!
But nothing surprised me at all. Exactly what I was waiting for with sadness is happening...
I took the children and elderly parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with the children, and only after that returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, he has consistently helped the Armed Forces of Ukraine and never for a moment doubted that in the case of occupation of the suburbs of Kiev, my family will not be spared.
Because I was and remain absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten communist-KGBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in a prison in the city of Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU was given to take a copy of the execution case of the great-grandfather: the whole thing is more than a hundred pages, but the sentence to execution is very simple and therefore even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, the guilt denied.
The ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was of free people, a poor "one-court" gentry, never went in serfs.
The fact that they lived in farms and had a few cows was enough to condemn the baker and the breadwinner of young children to execution.
My parents didn’t even know where the funeral was.
The grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the criminal case there is the name of the knocker Shari.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and would not be surprised if his relative was a KGB informant.
An apple from an apple tree not far away, as you know, falls...
The firing squad that condemned the execution of the peasants were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of his great-grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There are excellent (without sarcasm) information resources in Russia, such as the "Immortal Barracks", which qualitatively remind of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVDists have found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalin’s repressions and publicly wrote the names of murderers – the system first discredited, and then destroyed.
As if files with child pornography were found on the computer, for it they put in prison, and there he died quickly.
The KGB is still killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
Why are you suddenly surprised by their actions now?!
There are concentrated the most disgusting features of human nature.
Slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th-19th centuries were imposed on top of the thousand-year-old Horde tradition.
And then over what turned out, they did an animal genetic experiment, cutting out the intelligentsia during several waves of red terror.
Look at the semi-French film "Chekist" in 1992, that's how it was.
Have you seen my pictures in my swimsuit?
Can you ask my wife what I can buy from a cough .

But it's not necessary. Only if it is. I'm very grateful to you too.

As reported by “European truth”, writes Welt with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the Ministry of Economy of Germany on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including a training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As also offered howitzers in the variant on the APC Boxer for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in combat have to be selected relatively close to the enemy's targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
As reported by Ukrainian government circles with reference to the proposal of KMW, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will be carried out according to a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kyiv with 100 of its howitzers as soon as possible, and the gaps that have formed will then be filled by industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after the signing of the contract, that is, earlier than the second half of 2024.
The full supply will not be completed until 2027.
Is it in the morning or in the afternoon?

To make you happy.
I don't know, honey, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I think the way I feel about it is that we're together, that we're a couple.
I would say that after the war there will be a lot of work.
I’m not afraid I won’t find it there.
I can do a lot.
So I’m not afraid that I didn’t get into any of them.
I just don't know what's going to happen to the housing.
I need to be tested for making a food license. Can I do this with you?
Tell me, tomorrow for 5 guests to prepare the apartment.

I’m worried that everything will be fine!
Because we didn’t even talk about it with these excars!
I know how important this is to you!
And I am silent about myself (for me it’s just a top that can’t be reached)!
How do you feel today? after the celebration?
I'm sorry, I just woke up, I didn't sleep well.
Sorry to bother you.
I was upset that yesterday Kolya and I started to mistranslate the test.
I will ask whether Grigory Denisenko or maybe Jonashek)) to help me a little with mathematical concepts.
Can I be useful to them?
If possible, I would like to extend the mathematical deadline over the weekend.
Geometry in general is difficult, but we have to work with Kolya so that it was without errors.
Thank you for the test tasks
We hope so much for that too.
And so she is very pleased with any gift
Yab wanted to connect the Internet to her Czech number
Yesterday at the bus stop 402 I met a Ukrainian woman - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is herself... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we have agreed to be friends.
And last night I thank God for this girl, because this is the first person from Ukraine where my heart felt reciprocity.

So that she would not be afraid that no one would come
I did not go. Yes, I baked myself. I can do it! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
Are you leaving the city for a long time?
Six months ago, at the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we commemorated 80 years of mass shootings by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babyn Yar.
I had the honor to speak after three heads of state, among whom was the President of Germany.
He spoke about the common basis of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their own path and life in a territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
This foundation we must defend is also part of our responsibility in connection with our history.”
If “the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes,” he said, “then for us Germans, there can only be one answer: never again!
The fight must go on.”
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of civilians, starving the inhabitants of its blockaded cities and allowing them to die from diseases.
Russian troops carry out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the shootings in Babyn Yar.
For more than a month, Germans have been seeing this in the news in real time.
Thus, Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, as well as weapons, which was not so long ago impossible to imagine.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But “Never Again!” doesn’t just mean opposing the swastika.
This means fighting by all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and victims to defeat evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you at night
We agree, arrange a tour, and write when to be collected
All sick only Lydia did not get sick in them was an omicron a new kind of covid

This coupon I use instead of car
Call for late documents.

Sergey Sidorenko: Our membership in NATO is no longer a distant prospect
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in Donbas, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, to grow.
After the start of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine’s accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens – more than 75%.
Despite support for Ukraine’s accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO provides in wartime, there is now a lot of criticism of the Alliance and member-countries for the untimely supply of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the unwillingness to “irritate” Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon the desire for membership in the Alliance because of the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the podcast "Cursed Questions" together with the editor of "European Truth" we talk about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our prospect of NATO membership is close, as never in history, and why security guarantees are discussed with Russia.
What do you think is here
I have a volt partner marked that my Statement is under consideration.

Yes, my heart was sick.
I had a sincere feeling for this man, but he did not do it very decently and I left him.
After a while, he came back and apologized to me.
I turned him down.
Then, after a while, he called that he had had a heart operation.
I just wanted to talk to him and I felt sorry for him.
I have supported him psychologically for almost six months.
We talked a lot during that time.
I had problems at work at the same time.
His support also helped me at the time.
Such mutual help.
And I thought, maybe we really need to look at it differently.
And he asked me to marry him, and two days later he died.
God has decided our fate.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
He only speaks Czech.
I wanted to say that I managed to find a place to live, and I am very happy about it <0xE2><0x98><0xBA> now I have a place to live and I have a place to be with my child.

I perfectly understand the price of unskilled labor and understand that such a job as I had at home in Kiev, I will not be able to have here and the money that I earned at home, I will not get here now either.
But just to sit and do nothing, I can not, because then all sorts of bad thoughts creep into my head, so you need to engage yourself in some physical activity.
At the airport, documents are drawn up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., at other times you can just wait.

I don't remember this schedule.)
The Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kiev: they say “never done this before”
Konashenkov: “We see attempts of sabotage and the task of strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the armed forces of the Russian Federation will strike at decision-making centers, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army previously refrained.
The Russians launched missile strikes on Kiev from the first days of the full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles, which were shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system, fell on an apartment building in the capital Pozniaky.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a high-rise building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit the TV tower in Dorohozhychi near Babi Yar, killing 5 passers-by.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defense building over the Southern Railway Station.
On March 14, the wreckage of a downed occupier’s rocket smashed a house and a trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kyiv
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential area on Vinogradar, killing one person and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping mall in Vinogradar, killing at least 4 people.
The mayor of Kiev Vitali Klitschko once again said on April 13 that it is too early to return to the residents of the capital, who were evacuated from the city.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians can still launch missile attacks on Kiev, and in addition, there are a lot of mines and unexploded ordnance on the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning to conduct a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to blame the Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil depot exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, local authorities in Belgorod said that a “Ukrainian shell” had allegedly fallen near the city.
It is obvious that the elites in both Washington and Berlin are throwing themselves into a cold sweat at the very thought that NATO fighters will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much with them as with their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of people in the squares of the largest cities in Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who choose those politicians.
And these speeches, this graceful fusion of power, emotion, and sometimes despair, are gradually reaching their goal.
While the same Biden is categorically against the closure of the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels is against the acceleration of Ukraine’s accession, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want to be seen as a fraud.
The money you collect is better to give to people more in need.
I can come to you and we will decide on the spot. I still want to help

Tell me how you want it and I will do it.
I didn’t want to write today, for some reason.
Don't worry, I didn't come here to ask for anything.

Your brain can’t take it.
He's clinging to the old reality.
You call for work, find out whether to go out to work today or not.
You decide to leave your children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There's hope... it won't be for long.
Now... make a deal... something will happen.
The brain refuses to accept...
Where to go ?? I have no one and nowhere.
I've got $50 in my pocket, and we've spent everything we've had at home.
Many of our managers have not been paid a salary at our jobs.
Where do I go ?? Who needs me ? How do I provide for children ? Where do I live ?
You can't take a lot of things.
You didn't take anything out of the house... you have to drive 1,000 kilometers.
You don't know if you'll have anything to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag children all over Prague.
What's next? We don't know. How much is that? We don't know. Children ask for sweets. And you can't. It's expensive for you.
And from each iron - we do not have it.
We have a choice - to stay there and call the children to danger, or to try to save ourselves here.
She was very happy with the hearts and the things the kids gave her when she came to school.

These are tractors that actually go into the field under fire, because it's time to sow.
These are bus drivers who today agree to go in rubber convoys to the temporarily occupied territories in order to take help there and take people from there.
These are heroic leaders who, without fear, go to the combat zone, calm and help refugees in wagons, and help volunteers load humanitarian aid into wagons at peaceful stations.
These are gas stations that stood on the Zhytomyr highway in the early days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are utility workers who take out garbage under fire, repair water pipes and power lines to provide people with what they need.
These are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day, without complaining about anything, and in their free time they also volunteer, collecting first aid kits for the front.
In Ukraine, the juice stops when the little ones have leaves)
Please tell me, little children - what age do you mean?
My daughter is 8 years old, is this age acceptable?
I am looking for accommodation for me and my daughter for 3-4 days every day to come to the Czech Republic and transfer passports for a visa to Canada.
In Warsaw there are a lot of people in the visa center and do not work on-line queue.
I wanted to come for a day, but it is far away, it takes a lot of time to travel by train, the child will be difficult.
So I decided to look for accommodation in Prague or near it.
No, we are all satisfied

But I can't change my password when I click on a link because it gives me the following error:

The Czech Republic began issuing visas after March 22, in my opinion.
By that time - put stamps such and then equated these stamps to visas
The Foreign Electoral District of Ukraine (ZVO of Ukraine) is an electoral constituency that unites electoral precincts located outside the territory of Ukraine, and consists of voting premises in embassies and consulates of Ukraine and premises at military bases abroad,[note 1] on which the Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and DR of the Congo District) are located.[1]
In the Foreign constituency, only nationwide votes are held: elections of the President and people's deputies and all-Ukrainian referendums.
Local elections in the ZVO are not held.

Very tasty apples, what kind is it?
The head of the President’s Office, Andriy Yermak, said that Russia is launching a “fake operation” on weapons transferred to us by allies.
Yermak's direct speech: "They understand that they are losing the war, see their backwardness and seek to "crush" the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the last fakes is the alleged destruction of the S-300 air defense system transmitted by Slovakia.
This information has already been refuted by Prime Minister Edward Heger.
What will happen next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. The name of one of them.
They can run fakes that Ukrainian soldiers are allegedly surrendering with weapons from the allies, and it massively goes into service with the Russian army.
I want to warn you about such fakes right away.
Because the weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine exclusively send the enemy to the next world.
Excuse me, I forgot to ask how much a garden costs in a month and will it work in the summer?

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after the appearance of evidence that Russian forces committed atrocities against the civilian population in Ukraine, and Moscow rejected these reports as a “provocation”.
"Reports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops are worthy of condemnation," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
“Russia must answer to the world for what they have done,” she added, noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incident a “violation of international law.”
The statements came after reports emerged that hundreds of civilians had been shot and thrown into mass graves or left on the streets in the Kiev suburb of Bucha by Russian troops who had withdrawn from the area after weeks of occupation.
The photos, which allegedly depict the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for tougher sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there were signs that Russian troops had committed “war crimes” in Bucha.
“What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures,” Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should target Russian coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Russian troops could go so far as to commit “genocide” in Bucha.
“We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished,” Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the accusations as a "provocation".
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO “ordered” the image to discredit Russia.
“In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials, there is no doubt about who “ordered” this story,” – said Zakharova.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also said without evidence that the image of Bucha was “another staging of the Kiev regime” and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow has asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a “provocation by Ukrainian radicals” in Bucha.
On April 4, the Investigative Committee of Russia released a statement in which it announced an “investigation” on charges of spreading by Ukraine “knowingly false information” about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing “genocide” in the city, and told Kremlin leaders they should come to Bucha to see what their military had done.
“I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see their orders carried out,” Zelensky said in a video message, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
There is a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for shots in the back of the head,” he said.
He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held responsible for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
“When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and decapitated, I don’t understand,” he said of the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
A correspondent of the Ukrainian service of Radio Liberty on April 2 saw on the streets of a small city the bodies of civilians.
In just one place, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP reporters have seen the bodies of at least 21 people at various locations in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people – all in civilian clothes – were scattered on the ground near the site, which local residents say was used by Russian forces as a base.
The victims appear to have been killed at close range.
In total, Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the Kiev area, which until last week was controlled by Russian troops.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told: there is no Kyiv." How the occupiers despicably took Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, tortures.
In this list, there is another item about which there is currently much less information – the export of the local population to the territory of the enemy.
Since about mid-March, Russian occupiers have been “evacuating” Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually handed over to the Russian military training ground.
Ukrainska Pravda searched for the deported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" is taking place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text agreed to voluntary and forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with their families.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under severe coercion.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took out from there children without parents, including 12-year-old Myroslava, the daughter of the deceased champion of Ukraine in swimming Joseph Zachepinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander just got a job at the airport "Antonov", located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.
As true Plast members, Denis and Marina pre-assembled alarming suitcases, but in the morning of February 24, they did not have time to evacuate.
They did not have their own car, and the suburban buses no longer took anyone.
At about 12 noon on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them ran into a neighboring house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In all, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone has decided to go.
"At 6 p.m. on February 24, people came to the entrance who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
They ask, “Who is there?” – I say so. – “Come out!”.
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, if there were any weapons.
All the men were asked if they had served in the army.
The women were told, “We have come to protect you at the direction of Ramzan Kadyrov.”
It was the Chechen OMON, not even the army, young guys aged 25-35.
They said: "Here we were helped in the war by Ukrainians, Sashko Bilyi (commanded the detachment of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO Viking, who fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have come to help you."
On the third day, they asked us what we lacked.
We say water, there was a big problem with it.
They broke the store, took the goods from there under the pretext "the Russians will take it anyway" and brought us 6 bottles.
There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.
So, after the robbery of the store, they brought sausages and say: "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
No one wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child there says, “You have 7 days to give up our phones” – they laughed.
They constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they did not want war, Ukrainians are supported and generally good: “Putin is a freak, Kadyrov too, but we can’t do anything, because our families are there.”
And basically they did not fight, but went to rob shops, looted.
Chickens were brought to themselves, one was tied to one leg of St. George's ribbon, and to the other - their white tape and called it "militia".
They came to Ukraine not prepared at all.
I don’t know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten on Bucha, so that they didn’t even take the dead, they asked us, “Do you have artillery?”
Moreover, we had consolidated detachments – the Chechens did not know each other, in the first days they asked for passwords to find out whether they were their own or someone else’s.
They were with us until March 13, after which the Russian OMON arrived, and after them – the Omsk landing.
They put 30-40 pieces of equipment between the houses – our constantly fell into it from the Bayraktars.
But these came and told us that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are no longer there, but there is Azov, and, according to them, Azov has about 100 thousand in Ukraine.
The narrative of "Kiev has already surrendered" has been progressing since the beginning of March.
One day, a Russian came to us – either a landing officer or a representative of the FSB – and says that there will be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio – there was about Bucha, Gostomel, we thought, maybe we were given a “green corridor”.
From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: "You are taken to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov."
We say we don’t want to go there or there.
To which they replied: "Then pity the psyche of your children!"
How it worked: they chased us into the basement and started shooting from under the house – whether with Grads or mortars.
And then it flew back... Neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct hit on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand us over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
The part did not go, saying that it was for traitors of the homeland – he said, “you will be shot there, they will sell you for organs.”
We were taken through Chernobyl, there were fires on both sides of the road, broken equipment, although the Belarusians said that the Russians immediately took the equipment to them.
A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Mosquito", we passed improvised control, many were completely without documents, because they burned down.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, given tea.
And here we hear shots! A rocket shoots, and you can see the trace – it worked "Iskander" in Kiev.
Although those from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, these are planes flying, deploying at the border."
But we are from aviation, we have education, we understand what it is.
Then we were put on a bus and taken to the sanatorium "Chonki" near Gomel.
His manager, Wenger Vasyl Stepanovych, came and said: “Here I am, I’m from Chernihiv.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these thieves of yours are caught.
The poor people are suffering!
Lukashenka is so good!
As he says, so it shall be.”
They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "You are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN mission (at least they were called that) spread misinformation that men cannot go to Poland.
Many believed this and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, although we had a problem with the documents – the daughter did not have a passport.
We had to get it on Monday, and on Thursday the war began.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us at all, and in Minsk at the station they said that without passports no one would take a bus.
I would like to say that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were settled in Minsk, and escorted.
The sanatorium was not kept by force.
To our second group, the migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found an internal carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Driving near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border – UP), we saw the launches of ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the missile first takes off, glows beautifully, and then goes out.
People who got on the bus in Mozyr, said that the Russians there are constantly shooting from the training grounds.
But I can say that the Belarusians do not want to fight at all.
Generals are dismissed from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something of her son if he was called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk, do not believe at all.
They say, "You're lying, we're a peaceful people."
They do not perceive that their ranges are used for shelling of Ukraine.
In Poland, friends were waiting, who took us to Estonia.
Now we are going through the registration, we decide what we will do next.
There are probably as many Ukrainian flags in Estonia as there are Estonian ones.”
Maryna lived on the territory of the military town in Gostomel with her brother’s family – his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening, they went to spend the night in the basement of a neighboring house.
Marina herself could not return home and in principle will not be able to – the house is no longer there.
No one knew anything about the evacuation.

April 1, the mayor of Bucha Anatoly Fedoruk announced the happy news – the Ukrainian military on March 31 liberated the city from Russian invaders.
The next day, the occupiers were expelled from the entire Kiev region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should feel at this moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that at least 280 civilians were shot in Bucha alone.
They were killed just on the street, some were tied hands and shot in the back of the head, some of the killed were minors.
The mayor of the village Motyzhyn Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and son Alexander, who were kidnapped on March 23, were found dead and with traces of torture.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in the mass grave, Igor – in the sewers.
On both sides of the road 20 km from Kiev found the bodies of several naked women, wrapped in a blanket.
The Russians tried to burn them.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the Office of the President, writes “European Truth”.
“All the equipment, all that they are already sending, for some types of equipment it is too late.
So what if, for example, we are talking about Mariupol, when you are losing thousands of people, and now what?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100 percent support, it really is.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," Zelensky said.
When asked if Ukraine had enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied, “Not yet, not yet.”
The President also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, this war would not have happened, or it would have a different appearance.
“It would have unfolded differently, we would have the shoulder of close neighbors, we could have fought together.
But I am sure that there would be no war,” he added.
We will remind, the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military assistance, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.

He was a very rich man, after a while he called and reported that he had had heart surgery.
He asked me to just talk to him and support him, and I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man and thought maybe I was his toy and maybe I needed his money.
And then he made me an offer.
"There was a car in my yard that looked like a crocodile, and it was racing.
And they kept me in the house, then they took me to the basement, and there were a lot of people there, about 400 people, there was nothing to breathe.

“I tell her that the repair of the TV and radio was delayed due to imported parts, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to do too much when they call.”
“We have been hiding information about the war from our mother-in-law for a whole month.
So far it succeeds.
However, in Spots (cat – UP) on the pug and hind legs licked the fur – it can be from stress, changes in feed and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, but the stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The spot, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, hears both sirens and explosions."
Due to the fact that Olga does not hear well and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived for a month in an apartment with her "incognito".
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polova took up arms for the first time in her life.
"For 33 days I lived with her in an apartment as a partisan.
The war was hidden from her, and the fact that I was there – I formally came as usual for a few hours.
But when her friend spoke, I gave her the receiver – she listened for 4 hours, then 2 hours of singing.
The radio was always on the bed.
Most of the time the mother-in-law spends in her room.
It’s hard to hear – it allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "walking", I hid in my room.
First of all, I hid the receiver and the TV from her.
Then I called everyone who talked to her. That's 6-7 people.
She asked me to talk to her about anything but war.
I will ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end
It is April 17 - I have 2 apartments cleaning :)
Good evening, I never thought about it :)
Hey, if we need any more help tomorrow, we can come.

I'm telling you, the embassies are only here,
The British, who in the ranks of the Armed Forces defended Mariupol, says that they are ready to surrender to the Russians
The Briton, who is a serviceman of the Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: Twitter page of Aidin Aislin, a British man who served in the Armed Forces of Ukraine since 2018, the Air Force with reference to family members and friends of Aislin, Atlas News with reference to the words of Aislin's friend, who spoke to him
“We received a message from him: “48 days have passed, we have tried everything possible to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian troops.
We had no food or ammunition.
Thank you all, I hope the war ends soon.”
Details: Aislin served in the 36th Separate Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which participates in the defensive operation of Mariupol.
Air Force reporters contacted the mother of the serviceman, Ann Wood, and she confirmed that her son had reported on the phone that they were planning to surrender.
A friend of the military Brennan Phillips also confirmed to reporters that in the last telephone conversation, Aislin said about the plans of their unit to surrender.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Atlas News journalists contacted his friend, who said that Eislin's unit intends to surrender to the Russian units, so as not to fall without weapons and bullets into the hands of the troops of the so-called Kadyrovites.
Also in social networks distributed an audio recording of a telephone conversation, in which Aislin allegedly speaks with his American friend, who plans to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Aislin said that they tried in civilian clothes to get out of the city, but they failed.
Earlier, the Briton said that on Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company Wagner.
Aislin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 went to take part in the fight against terrorists of the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took the oath.
Aisle's friends and relatives called him Johnny, and in social networks he is better known under the nickname Cossack Gundi.

When you can bring things
You have a very interesting tradition, we go so on Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted bill 7176, which is called "On the monitoring of potential threats to the national security of Ukraine in the field of economy".
It is surprising that, in fact, the only potential threat to Ukraine’s national security in the economic sphere was... the place where the members of the supervisory board of state-owned companies and state-owned banks hold meetings.
The initiators of the bill believe that the adoption of decisions by the supervisory board of a state-owned company in conditional Kiev can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new risks for state-owned companies, but we do not yet know of any company that has a need to physically hold a supervisory board meeting at the location address.
The potential threat from such a law is clear – it is a great basis to “destroy” all the gains in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then install manual control.
The same as it was before 2015.
Why do state companies have supervisory boards and who should be included in them?
Moreover, if one harmful bill flies under patriotic slogans, others may fly tomorrow – for example, it is possible to demolish the public procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
A lot can be written off for war.
By the way, this initiative appeared even before the beginning of the war and bill 7176.
So, on February 22, this norm was included in the comparative table of the bill 5397.
In general, the desire to disperse the supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some people’s representatives for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will analyze the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our suggestions on how to solve the issue of managing state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such innovation by the risks of loss of the Internet and other means of communication, which will make it impossible for the supervisory boards to work remotely.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in connection with which the work of the company may be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but will it prevent members of supervisory boards from moving to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire composition) will put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the bill, they can be released.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum necessary for the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the Supervisory Board, since the law provides for the need to conduct a competitive selection, which on average lasts 3-4 months.
Therefore, the decision proposed by Bill 7176 will most likely not be able to protect the Supervisory Board from losing the ability to make decisions, but rather on the contrary will lead to this!
MP, author of the bill Dmytro Natalukha provides other arguments in support of it.
In particular, he notes: "many enterprises, in particular the military-industrial complex (MIC), now need relocation" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna on Zoom to discuss addresses and other sensitive information."
For starters, there are almost no state-owned defense enterprises in Ukraine that have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is only in Ukroboronprom, which in fact manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in Ukroboronprom, in accordance with the legislation, the supervisory board has rather limited powers, and all its members perform their duties on a non-free basis.
All power in Ukroboronrom belongs to the General Director, who, incidentally, will decide on the need to relocate a particular defense industry enterprise that is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not withstand criticism also because bill 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
Mr. Dmytro on his Facebook page also gives arguments that can be attributed to the category of "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, but let's try to analyze some of them: "respectable experts-foreigners at the first word "war" in 2021 leave Ukraine, but at the same time remain members of supervisory boards in state-owned enterprises of Ukraine with a real salary of several hundred thousand games."
First, it is a manipulation – most of these members of supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they “leave Ukraine” is, to put it mildly, unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been widespread in world practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
We should also not forget that membership in the Supervisory Board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other employment, and it is the means of electronic communication that help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not express identical claims to members of supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
They are also not located at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt of deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and war is only a new convenient opportunity.

In Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchansky districts of the Kiev region, which were liberated from the invaders, will introduce an increased curfew for 2 days.
In the settlements of Brovary, Vyshgorod and Buchansky districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew has been tightened!
On the territory of these cities and villages, the restrictions will be in force from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5.
Details: According to the head of the regional administration, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can only go outside during an alarm to go into shelters.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression – to clear and clear the territories.
Omelianyuk urged people who left these areas to refrain from returning home.
In the rest of the Kyiv region, the curfew will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.

The Serbian defense budget has been growing exponentially for several years in a row.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the renewal of military equipment and the acquisition of modern systems, rising to 22 places in the list of the most powerful military states in the world.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries quite seriously took the prediction of a possible aggravation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complicated and globalized.
If you don't mind, I'd like to come.

The Lukashenka regime detained three Belarusians, aged 27 and 28, who were involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signal unit near Osipovichi, which provides for the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radio Liberty", human rights center "Viasna", the head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, which is quoted by the state news agency "BelTA"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, with the support of special forces "SOBR" detained three residents of Bobruisk, one was wounded.
According to "Clear", when the men were detained, they actively resisted and tried to escape.
The security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were given medical assistance on the spot.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus Gennady Kazakevich said that "acts of terrorism on the railway of the Republic of Belarus will be severely stopped" by security forces using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovichi branch of BZD and the administrator of the thematic resources of BZD in VKontakte and Odnoklassniki Valentyn Samasiuk.
Where he is now and in what condition is unknown, reports <0x40>belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
The formation of BYpol, declared extremist by the Lukashenka regime, continues to call on Belarusians to sabotage railway transport and infrastructure facilities in Belarus as part of the “Victory” plan.
Belarusian “rail guerillas” are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, through Belarus, the Russian Federation transfers to fight, to Ukraine a living force and equipment.

We are now a week from Prague, we have a car, we are ready to partially pay for accommodation.
city or village does not matter, it is desirable that it was a separate apartment.
I pushed something into the water and connected two unnecessary shares for which I withdrew funds and I can not turn them off
and also removed the money from the card on which they were not
and I don't understand why the money was withdrawn
The cost of the repair is paid by the owner = Mr. Dedina. He should appear on Tuesday.
Be home on Tuesday and wait for the repairmen.
Can I ask you for a cigarette?
Can we change the mobile tariff if you have time? Is it too late?
U.S. bans investment in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, are imposing new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russia’s largest banks Alfa Bank and Sberbank, and also prohibit all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in the message on the website of the White House.
Sberbank is Russia’s largest government-owned financial institution and Alfa-Bank is Russia’s largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the U.S. financial system and prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in Russia.
To this end, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens regardless of their location.
“This step is based on the decision taken by more than 600 multinational companies to withdraw from Russia.
“The private sector’s output includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as law and consulting firms,” the White House said in a statement.
The third step of the new sanctions from the United States were restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sphere.
This would prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with these organizations and freeze any of their assets under U.S. jurisdiction.
A detailed list of the Ministry of Finance will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of Putin’s adult children, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including ex-President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
The sanctions disconnect them from the U.S. financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.
You will be able to get only to this place, then the passage is closed and I will come to you
Vera, can we wash the dishes in the car now?
My name is Olga, before the war I worked as a flight attendant of SkyUp, my mother - a seamstress of industrial products, son Makarchik went to kindergarten.
We lived well, but did not even think that we would be forced to run away, because there is no longer any strength to hide in the cellar.
I was lucky and found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
Therefore, we hope that someone will shelter us for the first time) We can even pay for a room or an apartment, but if we can afford it.
Cleanliness and order are guaranteed.
We don’t have bad habits.
We will be grateful for such help in such a difficult time for us.
I had one English lesson in the afternoon and after that I went to work in the children’s room.
I explained to Margarita there how to fill out all the documents.
I hope she understands and will do well.
And I also met Mrs. Lena and she talked about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She brought an ad from the pool.
It's a free swim.
You can call the school, Kira does not pick up the phone, does not answer, do not know if she has reached the school
They are isolating the Russian office: they are stopping investments and stopping supplies.

We'll meet on Thursday and tell you all about it.
It's all good.
How often do you clean?
I clean every week.
I don’t have a plan, but I’ll try to figure it out.
I dreamed of being a teacher.
My girls can’t move anywhere now, so I didn’t write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you that if you hear about housing information, you let me know.
I would be happy to rent a house with some decent girl.
If you can find one, let me know.
For my part, I will not let you down.
Thanks in advance.
I did not write you another person Natalia 54 years.Please write the exact address and how much the courses cost

Hello, Mr. Reyrard! Sorry I did not see it. I will do it now and send it to you right away.
We're going to the medical office now.
We don’t have to work another day.

Both beginners, apart from the alphabet, know nothing
Nothing's happening.

Children can take with them, toys are enough here :)
I guessed about Dad.
I’m probably very naive or very in love, but I’ll figure something out with that money.
We'll do it somehow.
But how it will be paid, please, no loans.
Write to me and I will help.
We are your partner, or I am not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
Should I bring the clothes I gave you?
today is not my day. broke the blinds in the living room. in the morning one. now in the evening another
Something came from you, I don't see what it is.
I am also very sad.
I'll tell you about the account later.
Do you speak and understand Russian?
What day does a colleague want to do house cleaning and how many windows does the house have?
I am ashamed to distract you from your business.
Good evening, I can not but share with you. There is a little girl from Mariupol for her son - alive and in service.
I advise you to read Joe Dispenza, he scientifically conducts experiments on the influence of external factors and the formation of new connections neurons
The journalist of the TV channel "1+1" Natalia Nagorna released a video on the morning of April 12, which was handed over to her by the military of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the military say that they have no weapons left to take part in the battles, and the mountain of the wounded.
He said, “The clock is ticking.”
Before that, on April 11, the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the fighters for two weeks.
The social networks expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny assured that the command’s connection with the defense forces in Mariupol is, and the details of the defense operation should not be subject to public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, the Russian occupiers dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
As reported by the leader of "Azov" Andrey Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the plant "Azovstal", which is held by the soldiers of the regiment "Azov".
Thank you, I will adapt to you. That would be very good
The situation is the same as long as we stay here.
2 hours drive )) walk, mom shopping and back)!
It's not a big deal.
She forgot what she was doing here.
The squadron of Czech drones has started flying over Ukraine from today. The squadron is now flying over Ukraine.
Almost 50 professional copters will be used for detection, and some of them - for the direct destruction of the enemy invaders.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers “birds” were sent to Ukraine yesterday thanks to the deputy of Mukachevo City Council Vladimir Labutenko.
Today, their friends in the mountains, led by the head of the village council and the coordinator https://www.facebook.com/example101/ Vasyl Shchur, delivered drones for their intended purpose: they were received by special units of Ukrainian troops in various cities where hostilities are currently ongoing.
In order to make the most effective and safe use of copters - the place of their deployment is currently kept secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop at what has been done, say: in the coming days, many interesting “gifts” will be sent to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I did not care, everything is fine. I love sweet, but I can do without it
I'm worried we won't make it.
I’ll be back in Ukraine soon, keep working.
All right, if it's okay, I'll take it.
I'll try it myself, but if there's any trouble, I'll text you if I can.
The main thing is to understand each other
We were personally in the old lady in the village in Jiva,she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there is no housing
Perhaps she will rejoice and her mood will rise
I got my phone repaired today.
And I think I'm freezing on the street today.
I drank medicine and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm sorry too, but I'd better meet you when I'm healthy.
When you have time, drop me the music you like.
I wonder what kind of music you have?
Mom and Dad have to listen.
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's stroller.
Today it was cooler and raining. Tomorrow should be warm.
But no pity for the destroyed houses, pity for the people who are bullied by the occupiers
In Kherson, the occupiers mocked the "Glory to Ukraine" memorial in Kherson on Perekopska Street.
It is noted that unknown persons tore the flag of the European Union, broke the panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and those who died in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers tore up portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the dead participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
They took down the flag.
Good morning, thanks to the children for the carol, we do not have such a custom so we did not know, gave the children only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else needed to give
In Czech, there is someone to talk to, if anything.
'Cause I'm living in a dorm, and there's gonna be people here at twelve, and then they're going to work.
Hello is a little better.
I was in the nursery today.
I slept there today.
We are already making great progress.
I'll definitely bring the dumplings another time!
I don’t have the strength to do them today.
Since I push away from the days and times when there is work on cleaning the apartments after the guests, I can say about the month of April because I already have an approximate schedule of cleaning the apartments.
For May month - I can say about the end of April or the beginning of May.
I just asked if you had anything to say about it.
Hi, I'm sorry that I did not write off for a long time, I cooked dinner and slept a little
If you don’t mind, can I come today?
We will meet you after your arrival.
He is modest with us, he has been learning a lot lately. I realized that he needs this very much in his life
Hi) everything went very well.
I was a little shocked to work with people in such a high position.
Today I had a lesson with a lady who is the director of the economy department of the edge of the heights.
She was very pleased with my work.
Grishko behaved well in the manger.
On Monday I have to bring proof of employment and cash payment for the nursery.
I've been moaning since Friday.
I don't do anything but do a lot of them and sleep a lot (and drink a lot of water).
If I go to the doctor tomorrow, I’ll go with you.
I need to do another analysis.
You won’t have to go again.
The drain tank works very badly, it washes badly. A master is needed. It needs to be adjusted.
That’s all there is to it.
Can you send me the correct email address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language course you have signed up for.
Do I have to bring my kids with me or do I have to bring them with me?
And now for a moment you can go there is one question
If you still need help, write.
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating Easter today, right?
We didn’t really want you to raise money so people wouldn’t think we were speculating on it!
But for online filling it was not enough for me two items:
I will lie down to rest. Gain strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. Good night
This is a great idea. I'm going to watch the video now. It's going to be good, because the whole family is going to draw.
Karazin University encourages employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.
Focus only on official information.
You can count on me, thank you!
my other brother who stayed in Ukraine also helps the army
I did some work on the portfolio.
After the holidays, they have to spend the Internet.
I would like to be your backup designer.
How to count the day that I was not at work is a pass
Staff: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of “aggression against a neighboring state.”
Literally: "It is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation conduct provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive grouping of troops for action in the Slobozhansky direction.
Probably, in the coming days, the occupiers will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Preparation of weapons and military equipment is carried out at the point of permanent deployment of the 60th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also, to restore the loss of personnel of units of the battalion tactical group from the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzya, Trans-Baikal Territory) of the 29th combined-arms army of the Eastern Military District, military personnel from the said brigade are recruited.
A special problem the enemy feels when filling the positions of drivers and mechanics-drivers.
Departure of selected personnel from the point of permanent deployment is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the places of combat operations, will continue attacks on transport infrastructure facilities on the territory of Ukraine with the aim of destroying or disabling them.
Certain units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansk direction, separate units from the 6th Combined Arms Army and Coastal Troops of the Northern Fleet continue the partial blockade of the city of Kharkov, artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
On the Izyum direction continues aerial reconnaissance of the area in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
To do this, the enemy uses the UAV "Orlan-10".
With forces of up to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to carry out an offensive in the directions of Dovhenke and Dmitrovka settlements, had no success and retreated to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus its main efforts on taking control of the settlements of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nizhne and Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out assault actions in the area of Zolote, had no success.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aircraft, the occupiers continue assault operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
By the forces of individual units, the enemy carried out artillery attacks on the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopillia, Trudolyubivka and Maryanske.
On the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine over the past day repelled four enemy attacks, destroyed five tanks, eight armored vehicles, six vehicles and eight artillery systems of the enemy.
Don't understand your thoughts?
Of course we will try to make it, but I doubt it.
How can you want to sleep and I'm holding you back?
You sure you don't mind if I come?
maybe you just don't want to see today, then tell me, I will understand)
Thank you. We did not watch TV at home and especially 1+1. We do not need to adjust :)
I turn on the TV here only to listen to the Czech language
I'm running out of money for a month :)
Can we do this on the phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, thread for embroidery
I know, I can prepare material in this area.
I'll ask her. I'm a little embarrassed to ask, she gives us so many pies.
We'll meet my father later, I'll be sure to meet him later.
I read the ad on Facebook ,but apparently Google wrote something in its own way. , I think the phone number is enough
Good afternoon, we brought things that you took, but are there things that we small can bring them to you in 10 minutes?
I thought about work.
If the director is satisfied, then I can start going to work next week because tomorrow before lunch I plan to go to the labor office to submit documents (if possible, because the queues are very large) and on Saturday it rains :)
I am looking for a team at the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I am learning Czech to know perfectly, I dream to work at Tevi
Friends old and not so old, friends with whom I do not know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Hard times have come for you, too.
Over the past month, I have spoken to many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, has turned upside down, as has the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted to feeling guilt and shame about your country’s actions toward your neighbors.
Because of why they are subjecting Ukraine on your behalf.
Some of you activists have long been under threat, and you have been preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, a very old friend of mine from the Memorial.
I'll tell you a little later, - as usual, Sasha replied succinctly. - Now after the search we are walking through the ruins.
Others – cultural figures, artists, critics, writers – are struck by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let’s be honest: with the exception of very few of you – those who worked at Memorial, Novaya Gazeta, Echo of Moscow, Meduza, Navalny’s organization, and in a number of other places – did many of you do anything to oppose this regime?
Except for the fact that they were still in the closet when it happened.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "It's late to hide, it's late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your long-term indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which are now probably a great burden on your soul and heart?
This was not always the case.
There was a brief period in the 1990s when you had some measure of freedom and democracy — messy, even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you end up with such a strong fear of embarrassment that you seek salvation behind the king’s back, whether his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still think it's safer around him.
In fact, mistakes were made.
Instead of capturing and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans did from the Stasi, you took your soul to the monument to Dzerzhinsky – and allowed the KGB to sink to the bottom, renew itself, reform itself and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with the choice between plundering the country and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option – and humbly accepted the plunder.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass rallies for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with the terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you still either voted for it, or preferred not to vote at all.
When he began to level Chechnya again, most of you turned a blind eye to it.
I remember those years well.
I was then working in Chechnya, helping the victims of Putin’s “anti-terrorist operation”, and saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurta, Itum-Kala and other cities.
Sometimes on the weekend I returned to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the children who were killed, the soldiers who sold the bodies to their families.
You told me, "Brad, we're tired of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
In response, I was indignant: “Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your government that is bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens.”
But no, it was all too difficult, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise of the mid-zero, driven by rising oil prices and Putin’s willingness to look through his fingers that some of the stolen money would remain in middle-class pockets.
Many of you have made a good living, some have become rich, and even the poorest of you have bought a new home and found a better job.
Prices have gone up, but is that a problem?
Moscow festively shone and shimmered with chic.
When several opposition figures – Yuri Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others – were killed, many of you were shocked and horrified at what was happening.
However, the matter did not go further.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the post of President Medvedev, and he took the place of Prime Minister, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.
When, after several months of Medvedev’s rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or fell silent.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in a cafe and in the Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that it is unlikely that we in the West did a lot, if anything at all.
A little outrage, a little sanctions; but what does it matter that Russia blatantly violates international law when there is such a great temptation on the part of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the hard 1990s, that was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin switched places with Medvedev again and took the presidency as before, many of you decided it was too much, and you went to the protests en masse.
Navalny’s name became a household name, you did not leave the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually felt with horror that it was losing ground under its feet.
After that, he struck back.
At first, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were behind bars.
Some have been given huge deadlines.
"And what could we do?"
I have heard it so often and I still hear it today.
“The state is so strong, and we are so weak.”
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angered by a pro-Russian president who had betrayed their European aspirations, they once seized the Maidan – and never left it.
They built a tent city on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, fittings and Molotov cocktails.
Eventually, the police opened fire.
But instead of running away, the protesters went on the attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and the Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to independently elect leaders and expel them if they do their job badly.
Maidan did not like Putin very much.
That was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he captured the Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but there was little use in it.
How many of you were excited!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
A new myth was suddenly born from somewhere, and many of you who despised Putin and his gang suddenly returned to the 180 degrees and began to adore him.
I find it difficult to find a reason, because immediately after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
“We don’t care about politics,” he said.
And you hid the new one in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, just like new after the restoration that the mayor of Moscow began in 2012, with their bingo, public wifi and hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful – and only gets better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
ISIS or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it in an interview, because I didn’t seem to understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw myself on the streets of Homs state snipers cold-bloodedly shoot at the peers of my children.
Among all the citizens of Russia, there were only your soldiers, who in 2015 began to bomb thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niemeller:
“At first they came for the socialists, but I didn’t say anything because I’m not a socialist.
Then they came for the trade unionists, but I didn’t say anything because I’m not a trade unionist.
Then they came for the Jews, but I kept silent, because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say anything in my defense.”
How many of you have spoken about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you have done it.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some really speak now – as, for example, Dmytro Glukhovsky, Mykhailo Shishkin, Mykhailo Zygar, Maksym Osipov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking to get into a new gulag or to form a company of Navalny.
As far as others are concerned, you know best what country you live in.
So I’m sure you understand that when Putin gets to grips with the Ukrainians — or, which seems very likely, if he doesn’t, he’ll get to you.
For all of you, my friends, for those who courageously, but mostly alone, went out to protest and have so far passed a minor term, but will soon receive a more serious one.
For the thousands of you who signed petitions, who disagreed on social networks (even if only with a black square on Instagram) or spoke in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given simply for anecdote, remained not in such a distant past – and now they, with a high probability, are waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you then? Who will remain?
The example of Ukrainians – even more so than in 2014 – frightens the Putin regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that reason, motivation, and courage can stop him, no matter how oppressive his superiority may be on paper.
In view of everything, few people in Russia are aware of this, as well as the fact that the war is going on at all.
But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be prepared.
You know where everything is going.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your choices are just hochma, your laws, if you do not take into account the repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media is no more, your economy is collapsing faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if some flights are still left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your obedience.
And if you don’t give him what he wants, you can try to either somehow leave, or you will be crushed.
I doubt you see any other option.
And yet there is one more.
Which will eventually bring down this regime.
And, perhaps, in the current conditions, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not flash from you: due to the economic collapse that is coming on Russia, it will most likely catch fire in the provinces, in small cities.
When prices soar and wages do not pay, those people who voted for Putin all these years, because they wanted bread and peace, will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people far more than he fears the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to the rallies on its own, as it has periodically happened, it will not be difficult to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be needed. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.
You have this wonderful magic tool – the Internet, which the mode can limit, but which still works and which can be set up under almost any circumstances.
Navalny’s organization has been defeated, but it is possible to create others that are more informal, more decentralized.
There are so many of you, millions of you.
The Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps hundreds of thousands.
If you get more than 300 thousand, she will be stunned.
We will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to business?
After all that he forced them to do in Ukraine, all that he forced them to go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel an understandable fear; those who have children will fear for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
If I were you, I would be scared too.
On the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dares not only to demand freedom, but really tries to get it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will throw a joke in a computer game chat – and be arrested; your daughter will express outrage on the Internet – and be arrested; your close friend will make mistakes – and die in a gray cell under police batons.
That’s what’s been going on for many years – and it’s only going to get worse as it gets bigger and bigger.
So you don't have a choice. If you don't do anything, you know how it's going to end.
Act coolly, think strategically, and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday, we were told we could come on Monday.
We'll be home in the evening.
What do you think of me as a press secretary?
How often do you go to an expensive restaurant for dinner?
Once a year I go out to dinner at an expensive restaurant
I’ll try to explain it to her.
So we liked it very nice and we wanted something closer so it's the best option
I was in a room with a lot of people. I got tired energetically.
I feel bad, cough, fever, voice gone, weakness and head spinning
I have to go to that labor government.
