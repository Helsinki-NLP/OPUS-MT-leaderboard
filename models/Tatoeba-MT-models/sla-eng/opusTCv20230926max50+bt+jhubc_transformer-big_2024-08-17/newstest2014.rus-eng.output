In Kineshma and the area, two men committed suicide
Earlier, one of the hanged had already attempted suicide.
On October 30, around 1-00, in the village of Lugovoe, at the place of his residence, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging.
It is known that he had previously attempted suicide.
What prompted the man to take such a step is unknown.
On October 31, at 11-50, at the place of residence, a 41-year-old man, a resident of Kineshma, committed suicide by hanging.
No signs of violent death were found, the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs "Kineshemsky".
Is there a black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair a crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box neatly attached to the dashboard of your car.
These devices, which track every mile a motorist drives and relay that information to officials, are at the center of a contentious effort to modernize America’s outdated highway financing system by the planning agencies of Washington and the state.
Usually, the boring planning arena of highways has suddenly given rise to intense debates and colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to give the government the right to use small boxes to track the number of miles you drive and even possibly where you drive them — and then use that information to compile tax returns.
The tea party is in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about privacy.
And while Congress can’t yet agree whether to continue or not, several states aren’t going to wait.
They are thinking about how, over the next decade, we can move to a system where drivers pay for every mile of the road they drive.
Thousands of motorists have already tested these black boxes, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is really necessary for our country.
“It’s not an issue that we can have a choice on,” said Hassan Ihrata, executive director of the Southern California Government Association, which is preparing plans to begin tracking the miles driven by each California motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
Technology already exists for this.
The need for this is aggravated by the lack of funds from the Government Fund for the Construction of Highways, financed by taxes that Americans pay at gas stations.
Americans don’t buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars travel more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not been raised for 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise the tax even by one cent at high prices for gasoline.
“The gasoline tax simply cannot be maintained,” said Lee Mannich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices were recently installed on cars to test the system of erroneous payment.
“It will be the best alternative in the long run,” he said.
Bored people call this an erroneous user fee.
Unsurprisingly, this idea appeals to urban liberals, as taxes could change the nature of travel to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Planners in California are eyeing the system as they develop strategies to meet the targets set by the state’s ambitious global warming laws.
However, Rep. Bill Schuster, a Republican from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he also sees the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free-marketers at Reason are also excited about making drivers pay for every mile.
“It’s not just a tax that will go into a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also backed by two former U.S. transportation ministers who in 2011 called on Congress to move toward a false payment.
The U.S. Senate approved last year a $90 million pilot project that would have involved about 10,000 vehicles.
However, House leaders rejected the proposal because of fears of rural legislators representing voters, who often have to travel many miles in their daily lives to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities, however, follow this path on their own.
The greatest enthusiasm is shown in the state of Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are involved in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon be paying the state for miles of mileage instead of a gasoline tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
It is under consideration in New York.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transportation departments of 17 East Coast states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is exploring how they can implement these changes.
This concept has not been universally recognized.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government could track their every move.
“Worrying about Big Brother and things like that is a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the tests were in full swing, the Nevada branch of the American Civil Liberties Union warned on its website: “It will be very easy to turn these devices into full-scale surveillance devices.”
There is no need to create a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to store records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states that are struggling to find an inexpensive technology that would allow state authorities to keep track of the miles driven by the car, but without information about the place and time.
If you can do that, Khan said, society will feel more at ease.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, this company was not engaged in assistance in the collection of state taxes.
It sought to enter the emerging market for a type of auto insurance in which drivers pay on the basis of mileage.
But the devices it tests attract road designers because they don’t use GPS and provide a limited amount of information that is periodically downloaded using a modem.
“People will be more likely to do this if you don’t track their speed and track their location,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.
There are much less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with giving drivers different options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they may abandon the device altogether, opting instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles all residents of the state drive.
Elsewhere, they hope to sell the idea to a wary public, forcing the devices to do more, not less.
In New York City, transportation officials are seeking to develop a tax-paying device that will also accept parking meter payments, provide “pay as you drive” insurance, and collect a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
“Motorists will be attracted to the participation of the benefits that they will be offered”, – stated in the document of urban planning.
Some transport system designers, however, are wondering if all the talk of erroneous payment is just a huge distraction.
In the San Francisco Bay Area city transportation commission, officials say Congress could very easily overcome the bankruptcy of the trust’s Highway Construction Fund by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on hybrid car drivers and others whose vehicles don’t use a lot of gasoline to make them pay their fair share.
“There’s no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the Commission on Legislation and Public Relations.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and a lot of other things.
The EU is preparing measures to support Ukraine in case of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a contingency plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on an emergency loan, if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius summit.
The IMF is negotiating a stand-by loan, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their goal is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
At the same time, in addition to a potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts polled by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF are able to overcome long-standing disagreements over funding conditions.
He does not believe in the possibility of reforms necessary to obtain assistance, and the international rating agency S&P, which on Friday lowered the sovereign rating of Ukraine by one step - to "B-" with "B".
However, EU officials say that the IMF can show flexibility in terms of lending, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the plan of financial support for the country, the EU has a backup option to provide Ukraine with gas, the vast majority of which now comes from Russia.
Perhaps it will be gas from Nord Stream or reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way in case Russia “isolates” Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reverse deliveries to Ukraine can be used only for a few weeks, and is likely to lead to a decrease in supplies to other regions.
“Negotiations are underway between EU countries and Ukrainians on how to create favorable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes,” the source added.
Russia out of the fight for pollution of cities by cars
Attempts to solve the transport problems of large cities have been observed in most megacities of the world since the second half of the twentieth century.
As a rule, it was either about their reorganization and expansion of the highways, or about attempts to reduce the demand for road trips, the number of cars and the time of their use.
A well-known example of Singapore, which introduced a strict quota for the growth of the number of private cars, and the right to purchase them is purchased at auctions.
Its price can be two to three times the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced a fee for entry into the city center.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, the so-called green zones are introduced, where only cars with a certain eco-class are allowed to enter, which also use high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric cars).
Beijing’s Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved a “five-year clean air plan” in 2012 with a total value of about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
According to Li Kunsheng, director of the Transportation Pollution Control Division of Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, the main goal of the five-year plan is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, increase the number of private cars to no more than 6 million (now 5.2 million), and increase the use of fuel per vehicle by no more than 5%.
According to the agency, now motor transport in Beijing is responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the program is the restriction of the use of road transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, the urban measures of the "green five-year plan" include an accelerated transition to European fuel standards compared to the rest of the country, the introduction of a local system of eco-standards and marking of cars and fuel, a restriction on the entry of cars into the central part of the city, a ban on the use of outdated vehicles (in addition, the creation of public transport and the development of electric vehicles to replace old cars with electric vehicles).
Beijing's automotive innovations also include a ban on all private cars to move within the fifth transport ring (there are six in the capital of China) one day a week (the relevant information is contained in the license plate of the vehicle), as well as the issuance of registration plates for cars based on the lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of operation of the lottery, the total number of cars in the registration part).
According to the current state program “Environmental Protection for 2012-2020”, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Natural Resources, in 2011 “mobile sources” accounted for 41% of all emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere of cities.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than industrial, and in St. Petersburg - nine times.
Russia is just beginning to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
Mikhail Blinkin, Director of the HSE Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for road travel are obviously unpopular, they can be taken by society only if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem associated with the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters of weakly sensitive to any regulatory influences - office and personal cars, as well as cars of "privileged" users, the total number of which is at least 200 thousand (about 5% of the total number of Moscow's fleet).
Recently, urbanists from the ECOM center in St. Petersburg prepared a study that analyzes the balance of urban areas between residential development, the area of the road surface and the number of vehicles.
The main findings of the researchers: the city center is provided with roads half as much as required, and most motorists living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time in parking lots or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build not parking lots, but car storages, not to expand, but to reduce the roadway (so that the streets become more pedestrian-friendly), as well as to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the territory of the protection zone of the historical center (a total area of about 3,212 hectares, covering a number of central areas of the city).
Fines for unauthorized street trade in Vologda will increase at times
According to the city authorities, increasing the size of fines will help to restore order in Vologda and free the streets from spontaneous tents and trays.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, the products they sell often do not pass the appropriate sanitary control.
And this means that the health of moisture is at risk.
Thus, the lower limit of the fine for citizens for unauthorized trade from November will increase by six times - from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, the press service of the Administration of Vologda.
Goldman Sachs warned about the risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs has warned of growing risks to Russia’s main driver of fragile economic growth – consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of non-payment on unsecured consumer loans and mass layoffs of workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather the structure of that growth.
Recently, it is entirely due to consumption, which almost does not reduce turnover, ”said the chief economist of Goldman Sachs for Russia, Clemens Grafe, presenting yesterday the quarterly report of the investment bank on the Russian economy.
Now the nominal wage growth in Russia is about 10%.
With an inflation rate of 6%, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at about the current level, Goldman Sachs expects.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so most likely they will be engaged in optimizing personnel costs.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages grow by 10%, then GDP - only by 2%, - Mr. Grafe explained.
Companies are facing a reduction in profitability.
If it does not grow, it can lead to layoffs and an increase in unemployment.
Russian business can not not raise wages, comments the chief economist of Barclays Capital for Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantyushin.
Unemployment near historic lows, competition for workers is high.
To lure employees away or keep current ones, employers have to raise wages.
Consumption in Russia is supported by a very rapid growth in demand for credit.
According to Mr. Grafe, due to the extremely high rates on consumer loans, this type of lending does not have a multiplier effect on the country's economy.
“We have not seen any benefits for the economy from the growth of lending, money does not diverge across the economy, but returns to the same banks in the form of interest payments,” the economist said.
But the problem is the other - Goldman Sachs expect an increase in late payments on unsecured loans.
They are taken mainly by poor people who have nothing to provide.
The interest rates on these loans are high.
As a result, they are often not returned,” said Mr. Grafe.
Therefore, the second threat to economic growth in Russia is a possible crisis of non-payment on unsecured loans.
Vasyl Solodkov, Director of the HSE Banking Institute, is already seeing signs of an impending banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to cheap resources, such as state banks, were forced to attract public funds at high interest rates.
In response, state banks came to the path of war and began to reduce credit rates, - continues the economist.
Small credit institutions cannot lend at the same interest rate, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If the state banks do not abandon dumping, Russia faces a full-fledged banking crisis, believes Vasily Solodkov.
The deprivation of licenses of a number of banks in recent weeks, the economist considers a harbinger of mass collapse.
"The state banks themselves will not cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis," the head of the institute warns.
But consumption growth will slow down without a crisis of non-payments, the investment bank believes, due to the refusal to index the salaries of civil servants and the military, laid down in the current version of the draft budget.
Partially, the impact on consumption will be mitigated by the freezing of natural monopoly tariffs (and, as a consequence, a decrease in inflation).
But only partially: if investments do not grow (and there are no prerequisites for this yet - see the reference), consumption growth will still slow down, Goldman Sachs is sure.
Vladimir Pantyushin of Barclays Capital does not yet see the prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
“The main risk is still falling oil prices,” he says.
According to him, the economy of Russia will begin to decline at the cost of oil below $ 90 / barrel.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank is not yet able to reduce interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical picture: inflation has decreased, and banks have begun to raise rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the Central Bank, which announced the transition to inflation targeting, "- said Clemens Grafe.
The interest rate policy of the Central Bank does not affect market rates, it only affects interbank lending rates.
“For the Central Bank, this is a collapse of all hopes,” said Clement Graff.
The money received at the Central Bank auctions is used by banks not to lend to the economy, but to manage their liquidity.
As soon as the rate decreases, the exchange rate changes immediately, this means that the funds are trying to go to speculation against the ruble.
“Sooner or later, the Central Bank will understand that this strategy does not work,” said Mr. Grafe and recalled that the state plans to release the ruble into “free circulation” by the end of 2015.
But you will either have to do it sooner, or raise the key rate of the Central Bank (5.5%), he believes.
According to him, the ruble is now artificially inflated by 10%.
There is only one way to lose weight, the expert concludes.
But if the Central Bank plunges into the financiers even a shadow of doubt that the elimination of the currency corridor is not part of the policy to weaken the ruble, it can bring down the ruble much stronger.
The Second Congress of the Peoples of the Southern Urals was held in Chelyabinsk.
The forum is timed to the Day of National Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of Russia.
The congress was attended by delegations from all cities and districts of the region, representatives of national cultural associations, religious confessions, legislative and executive authorities - a total of about 350 people.
The course of the forum is aimed at strengthening interethnic harmony.
Here we can show an example not only to other regions, but also to other countries.
We have no differences and disagreements.
We live in full mutual understanding,” says Feofan, Metropolitan of Chelyabinsk and Zlatoust.
During the meeting, a number of issues were considered, including the education of patriotism, cultural cooperation.
As a result of the congress, a resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued in the Opera and Ballet Theatre.
An exhibition of national and cultural associations of the Chelyabinsk region was opened here.
Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany on the issue of U.S. intelligence
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence whistleblower, said he was ready to travel to Berlin to testify to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, could not answer questions about their activities.
German lawmaker Hans-Christian Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter from Mr. Snowden, which the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, he said: “Although the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political statements with criminal charges that do not provide any protection.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the US government to drop criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany’s interior minister, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible.”
Relations between the U.S. and Germany have become strained after allegations that the NSA tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Opperman, a lawmaker who heads the parliamentary group overseeing the intelligence service, said that if there is an opportunity to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness, “without putting him in danger and destroying relations with the United States completely,” it should be used.
Mr. Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele, a member of parliament from Germany’s Green Party, tweeted a picture of himself with Mr. Snowden.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Stroebele said that, according to a lawyer for a former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden would not have been able to return to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be “safe there,” the lawmaker said.
Mr Snowden said in his letter that he faced a “hard and steady” harassment campaign that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said he was encouraged by the world’s reaction to “his political statements.”
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking officials — including in the United States — have found exposing an unchecked system of pervasive surveillance beneficial to society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved”.
Frontier Airlines will charge a fee for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for carrying hand luggage on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday said passengers would be able to keep the entire can.
The new hand luggage fee applies to bags in the upper luggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if travelers will only pay once they are at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O’Malley said the $100 fee should force passengers to take care of payment in advance.
“We don’t want to charge for it,” she said.
Airlines began charging for the first and second handbags in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges are stuffed as much as they can into hand luggage placed in the upper luggage compartments, which is why there is often not enough space in these compartments.
Charges are one way to get passengers to carry less on board.
O'Malley said that this new fee isn't really about making money.
The fact is that the most loyal Frontier customers say that finding a place in the upper luggage compartments is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in the queue at the exit of the Frontier flight can get the opportunity to carry a bag for free, while the next passenger in the queue can pay $100 for the same bag.
O’Malley said the change of procedures on the website and at Frontier check-in counters is designed to ensure that passengers will be aware of the pickup before they get to the boarding gate.
The new Frontier hand luggage charge will not start until the summer, although the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They argue that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need this service have to pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, most of them did not relate to the fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first hand luggage charge three years ago, and another Allegiant Air discounter later followed suit.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the surcharges.
According to his estimate in a December 2011 report, the fee for hand luggage brings Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines top manager, recently flew on a Spirit flight, and was curious about what he would find at the boarding gate when passengers faced an unusual Spirit charge for hand luggage.
“The landing process was the smoothest I’ve seen in my airline career,” he said.
I expected to see teeth grinding and a skirmish at the landing gate.
The plane was full, he said, “and the landing was swift.”
Frontier also follows Spirit on a $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier said that passengers who receive soda or juice can keep the entire can and that the coffee will be served free of charge.
She will continue to give away water free of charge.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for the drinks in 2008, but declined seven months later after passengers began complaining and no other major airline followed suit.
Frontier’s initiative to charge for hand luggage when passengers don’t buy tickets directly from the airline is its latest move to attract customers to its website.
Airlines pay online ticket sellers, such as Orbitz, $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, rather than contacting an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began giving half the bonus miles of a frequent flyer to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it cut the premium number of miles to 25 percent of the trip’s miles.
For example, a 1,000-mile trip with Frontier, purchased from an online travel agency, would allow you to get 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can choose a seat in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in her hometown of Denver, but its business is shrinking and becoming unprofitable.
Revenue fell 9 percent and flight capabilities fell nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released on Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sale.
The NSA blames “internal error” and not hackers in the termination of the site
The National Security Agency, shrouded in secrecy, said on Friday evening that the shutdown of their website for several hours caused a technical glitch, not hackers, as alleged on the network.
“NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update,” the agency said in an official email.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack are incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems registered that the NSA website had been down for at least six hours and the site was still inaccessible to some users.
Earlier, a representative of the NSA told ABC News that the internal secret network of the agency “not at all” was hacked.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one online group of activist hackers said it was responsible for disabling the NSA website through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to overwhelm the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site fails.
Hackers’ tactics are relatively simple, and attacks are not designed to penetrate the target system’s internal network.
The previously super-secret NSA, once nicknamed “No Such Agency,” has been in the spotlight in recent months after a string of revelations about its extensive surveillance programs abroad and domestically — all a reaction to classified NSA files stolen from the agency and published by a disillusioned former NSA employee.
The growing controversy surrounding the agency has sparked speculation that today’s incident was the result of targeted hacking.
Bombardier profit declines with falling deliveries and number of aircraft orders
Bombardier Corporation, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported a 15 percent reduction in net profit on Thursday due to a decrease in orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in its rail division.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its newest CSeries aircraft, nor did it provide new information on whether ambitious plans to commercialize the aircraft by next September would be implemented.
After the first flight of the prototype aircraft, which took place about a month and a half ago, it flew only three more times, which raises questions about whether the stage of testing is on schedule.
The results did not meet forecasts and led to a fall in shares of more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerken, an analyst at National Bank Financial, downgraded his valuation on Thursday from “above-average” to “average” due to a belief that stock growth is limited in the coming quarter or two.
“While the decline in aircraft shipments was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the revenue performance of the transportation department,” Doerxen said in a stock market review.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will allow it to win a place in the lower price segment of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first prototype of the aircraft was presented in March and flew for the first time in September after several months of delay.
However, firm orders for the CSeries so far are not too many – 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to verify the company’s claims about the fuel efficiency and potential economy of the new liner.
In total, there are now 403 orders and agreements with 15 customers and operators.
CEO Pierre Baudoin was confident that Bombardier would reach its target of 300 firm orders by the time the first aircraft was put into commercial service.
On Thursday, executives also assured analysts and the media that the program is moving forward as planned.
"The test model of the aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Baudouin said during a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned for the aircraft's downtime.
All manufacturers plan tests differently.
We decided to make the first flight and take a break for updates, so we did.
This will be the case throughout the flight test program.
The second of five test samples is due to fly in the coming weeks and all the others will soon follow, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical about the claim that the first customer will be able to start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said it was assessing the timing of the commissioning and would provide new information in the next few months.
“This slow pace of flight testing – while apparently consistent with Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that commissioning will be pushed back to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerxen said.
In the third quarter ending Sept. 30, Bombardier’s net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Gross income decreased slightly - from $ 4.2 to $ 4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and gross income of $ 4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it delivered 45 aircraft per quarter, down from 57 the previous year.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The aerospace division’s order book totaled $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31.
"In the aerospace field, the results were in line with our goals, but the small number of incoming orders and the overall market conditions have become an unpleasant factor," Baudouin said.
Gross revenue in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train maker, said gross revenue in the sector rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport division amounted to $32.6 billion as of September 30, which is slightly higher than the figure of December 31.
The revenues of the transport unit were negatively affected by problems with the execution of several large contracts.
The management said that a new development plan will be presented in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that Google chief financial officer Patrick Peachett will join the board of directors, fell 8.5 percent to C$4.83 at mid-Thursday's auction.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest competitor, said on Thursday it had cut its quarterly revenue by 10 percent.
Sony expects a lower annual profit
Japanese electronics manufacturer Sony Corporation, having completed the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced its forecast for profit for the current fiscal year.
Sony’s performance between July and September 2013 was more disappointing than expected due to the drop in demand for Japanese-made TVs, camcorders and personal computers.
Sony’s television business, which brought the company its first operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in three years in the second quarter, fell again to 9.3 billion yen in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is going through hard times, especially due to the decline in demand for televisions.
And while competitors are looking for a way out of the difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony’s main rivals, Panasonic Corporation, has recently shifted its focus to industrial components: here the company’s sales are growing at a high rate, especially due to automotive systems and environmentally friendly technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion yen operating profit against the previously expected 230 billion yen.
At the same time, according to the Thomson Reuters agency, analysts assumed that this figure would be significantly higher and amount to 221 billion yen.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding its product line.
In the middle of this month, it was announced the start of sales of “smart” watches from the Japanese corporation, endowed with a number of fashionable functions that will eliminate the need to get a smartphone out of your pocket 100 times a day.
After Sony lowered its annual profit and revenue forecast, the company’s shares fell more than 11 percent at the opening in Tokyo this morning, dropping to 1,668 yen per share.
The gene of speech was a stimulant of synapse formation
Scientists from Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai School of Medicine have discovered a protein through which the “voice gene” Foxp2 performs its function by stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, on the website of the journal you can read its summary.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
His role was established in 2001 thanks to the discovery of a family of several people who could not pronounce words correctly and sometimes did not even understand each other.
The researchers found that the Foxp2 gene was disrupted in the family members, but how it performs its function remains unknown.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of its functions Foxp2 performs as a stimulant of the formation of new synapses in the brain area associated with the formation of speech.
It does this thanks to another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of the search for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 turned out to be one of the 10 similar genes found by the authors, with Foxp2 showing only its activity.
The fact that SRPX2 really affects vocalization, scientists confirmed in an experiment on mice.
When the animals’ gene activity was artificially reduced, they screamed less when separated from their mother.
If the activity of the gene was restored, the frequency of sounds emitted was also restored.
Previously, mice were also shown to be associated with the vocalization of Foxp2 itself.
The animals injected with a human copy of the gene ate more actively and at a lower frequency than normal mice.
So far, however, scientists do not know whether Foxp2 and its SRPX2 are related to purely “mechanical” sound-forming properties or to more subtle processes.
A cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned the leader of a criminal group about a police investigation has been jailed
42-year-old Basharat Detta passed information to criminal authority Neil Scarborough
The lawyer feared that his secret drug addiction would be revealed.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Royal Court of Liverpool.
A prestigious lawyer who told the drug lord about a major police investigation because he was afraid of exposing his secret drug addiction was jailed for three years.
The 42-year-old Basharat Detta was leaking classified information to criminal authority Neil Scarborough about an investigation into his drug-trafficking activities after he was threatened by his cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed Bash and dubbed a “cool lawyer” among criminals, was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police surveillance operation on Scarborough, which he represented earlier in a drug-related trial.
Officers noticed the 32-year-old Scarborough leaving three bags of cocaine at a lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was at a lawyer's association dinner with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta “regularly used” a class A drug, after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
During the eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two people on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police surveillance at the time as part of a large-scale investigation into the heroin and cocaine trafficking ring in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later jailed after police seized <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine and more than <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash in a series of raids.
The 42-year-old Dita passed information to criminals out of fear that his cocaine addiction would be exposed.
Today at Liverpool’s Royal Court, Ditta, who works for the law firm Forbes Solicitors, based in Blackburn, was shamed after being found guilty of two counts of intentionally obstructing the administration of justice following a three-week trial at the Liverpool Crown Court.
He confessed to possession of cocaine at a previous court hearing.
The lawyer’s exposure came after police investigating Scarborough’s activities found out that he had regularly spoken to Ditt on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and found him approaching Ditt’s home in Blackburn and placing drugs of 60 percent purity in a black golf glove under the lawyer’s trash cans.
Shortly after the show, Scarborough repeatedly called Ditt, who was at a dinner party at Blackburn Rovers' Ewood Park football stadium.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; there were nine conversations between them.
The court learned that Ditta “regularly used” cocaine after tests found traces of a class A drug in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, said he spoke to the suspected dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their communication was a “lawyer’s secret.”
During his detention, Ditta took his wallet and tried to take out several credit cards, but they were all confiscated, he also had a hair sample taken.
At the police interrogation, he said that along with the workplace, he had a home office, and clients came to his home for legal matters.
However, the court learned that after important arrests, he called the largest participants in drug trafficking, a number of which he had previously represented in court to tell what detectives knew about them.
In the indictment, White said, “If anyone knows that you shouldn’t break the law, it’s a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer because he has entered into too close a relationship with certain clients.
The contact we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly prove legitimate since he was their lawyer.
However, this has to a large extent gone beyond the boundaries of the usual lawyer-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as possible to allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but disgraced it.
He became too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, and allowed his disinterest to be questioned.
Ditta pleaded not guilty and said: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and would like to pass the information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, I would do it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Senior Officer Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said, “Mr. Ditta went from a criminal lawyer to a criminal as soon as he started buying drugs from organized crime.”
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the purposes of the main members of the criminal gangs, who entrusted him with obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire trust and confidence in society.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to cover up his profession.
The investigation into Mr. Ditt was led by Lancashire's Specially Dangerous Organised Crime Unit, which has already convicted him of three cocaine possession cases and now of obstruction of justice, demonstrating our commitment to achieving fair punishment for criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 people involved in the fraud were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditta organized a question-and-answer conversation in which he says that his dream job is a lawyer representing clients on death row in America, the ideal companion for him at dinner is Mohammed Ali, and the motivation behind the job is inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslavl is not ready to receive 22,000 spectators, said police officers who were present today at the meeting of the RFU KDC.
The ticket program is inflated, in their opinion, about twice.
During the match of the 1/16 finals of the Cup of Russia with Spartak, only a thousand stewards were involved, with a regulatory norm of nine thousand.
Spartak fans were supposed to have 2,200 seats, that is, 10 percent of the capacity of the stadium, however, according to the agreement with the Moscow club, they were sold 5 thousand tickets.
These data were announced by the head of the CDC Artur Grigoryants.
U.S. eavesdropped on Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, November 1, a U.S. intelligence official who chose not to reveal his name said the U.S. was eavesdropping on the phone conversations of high-ranking Japanese officials.
This man confirmed that in the land of the rising sun there are several points intended for listening.
At the same time, he noted that the United States, Great Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand do not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
According to him, this happened during the Second World War, when these countries were allies.
But Japan, like Germany, despite allied relations with the Americans in the post-war period, are objects for intelligence activities, NHK reported.
Officially, none of the parties has yet commented on this information.
We will remind, news about the surveillance of the US intelligence services for the Chancellor of Germany appeared last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA has been able to tap Merkel’s phone for the past ten years.
The chancellor herself, according to some reports, took the news of her wiretapping very painfully.
She said that the allies, which, in her opinion, are Germany and the United States for decades, such surveillance of the head of government is unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden said that he was ready to share details about the wiretapping of Angela Merkel’s phone conversations with employees of the German prosecutor’s office.
The German flew to Moscow to meet a former CIA officer.
Bashkiria may put the grain on the auction no earlier than the beginning of 2014
Bashkiria in the course of public procurement interventions may put grain on the auction no earlier than the beginning of 2014, said the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
As long as the price in the market is higher, and there is demand.
"Perhaps the grain will be put up for auction after the New Year," he said at a press conference yesterday.
The Minister recalled that this year, crops under the 2013 harvest amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including the area of grain crops - 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% more than last year.
Under the harvest of 2014 planted 550,000 hectares (105 thousand hectares more than in 2012).
The areas for winter wheat and triticale have been increased, the rye remained at the same level.
In the databases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs there is no group "Brotherly Circle", to which Leps was included in the United States
In the databases of the Russian security forces of the “Brotherly Circle” group, to which Washington has included the singer Grigory Leps, is not listed.
As noted by “Interfax” in law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after the media reported on the inclusion of the US Treasury Department Gregory Leps in the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian crime syndicate “Brotherly Circle”, all databases were checked, but such a group was not found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to maintaining the myth of the so-called “Russian mafia”, which allegedly operates abroad, according to law enforcement agencies.
"Even in the very name - 'Brotherly Circle', there is an element of mystery, there is a hint of a secret bed.
“All this is very similar to a PR campaign,” the agency’s source said.
On October 31, the U.S. Treasury announced the inclusion in its control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian crime syndicate "Brotherly Circle" of Arthur Badalyan, Grigory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergey Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalsky and Igor Shlykov.
The individuals on the list are suspected of having links to Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rakhimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on U.S. sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Grigory Leps "serves as a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev."
In the production center of Grigory Leps refused to comment on the US accusations against the singer, calling them “delusional”.
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama classified the Brotherhood Syndicate as a “substantial transnational organized crime group” and instructed the Treasury to “undermine and prohibit their global criminal operations.”
The inclusion of a person on the blacklist of the American Ministry of Finance entails the blocking of his assets in the United States and a ban on business contacts with him by persons living in the States.
Scandalous video went to the police
The head of Toronto Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and frankly reckless antics, got caught smoking crack.
Police in the Canadian city said they had the video and were ready to launch an investigation against the mayor.
He said he would not leave his post, CNN reported.
Information that the authorities have evidence of drug use by Rob Ford, appeared on the website of the Toronto police.
The head of local law enforcement, Bill Blair, held a press conference on this issue.
The sheriff said that he was not authorized to share the footage with the public, but he vouches for their existence.
According to Blair, compromising Rob Ford video was discovered during an anti-drug raid conducted by the guards in the summer of 2013.
Previously, the existence of this video has already been written by the Canadian press, but until recently there was no confirmation.
The mayor himself has not commented on the matter.
He just says that he is not guilty of anything and is not going to resign.
The video, discovered by police, is one of the evidence in the case of 35-year-old friend of Ford Alexander Lisi, who is accused of light drug trafficking, extortion, obtaining illegal income, as well as criminal conspiracy.
Sometimes Lisi served as the driver of Rob Ford.
Residents of the city have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He repeatedly fought with journalists, appeared in public drunk, allowed himself racist and sexist statements.
JSC "Rostovaeroinvest" recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender for the choice of the general designer of the object.

Turkish politician goes on hunger strike against wall on border with Syria
In mid-October, authorities began building a separation wall near the town of Nusaybin in southeastern Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the pro-Kurdish party of the PMD strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaybin, located on the border with Syria, Aishe Gekhan announced a hunger strike, protesting against the construction of a separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, RIA Novosti reported in the press service of the Peace and Democracy Party (PMD) on Friday.
The police have repeatedly dispersed the protest demonstrations.
Turkish Foreign Minister Muammer G<0xC3><0xBC>ler first denied the fact of construction, then said that the wall is being built to ensure border security.
"Nusaibin Mayor Ayshe Gekhan, a member of the PMD, has declared a hunger strike, thus turning her protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle," the party's press service said.
The mayor believes that the construction of the wall is designed to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, the Kurds crossed this border freely for half a century.
"This is an inhuman situation that the Kurds will never agree to," Aisha Gekhan was quoted as saying by party officials.
According to the press service, on November 7, a rally against the construction of the separation wall is planned in Nusaybin.
Venezuela will set the exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate of its national currency - bolivar - against the dollar for tourists.
This was reported by Bloomberg on November 1, citing a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange amounts equivalent to ten thousand US dollars per year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 percent of the bolivars purchased in the country at the time of departure.
The specific exchange rate of the bolivar against the dollar will be determined at a later date.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivars per dollar.
On the black market, however, one dollar is valued at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 percent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 percent.
Oil Minister and Vice President for Economics Rafael Ramirez said on October 18 that Venezuela has no plans to devalue the bolivar.
According to unofficial information provided by the agency, Caracas may still decide to reduce the exchange rate of the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of restraining the prices of food and consumer goods, as well as the high degree of overregulation of the Venezuelan economy, led to the shortage of a number of goods and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media wrote that there was a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
Director of Ugra Andrey Belmach noted that it is difficult to say how long it will take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
The resignation took place just a few hours ago, so to say how long it will take to find a new coach, I am not ready, - ITAR-TASS quotes the words of Belmach.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We are exploring all possible options.
Priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
I want not just to find a coach, but a person who will work in our club for several years and achieve certain results with him.
Kenyan press outraged by provocative media law
“This is a terrible place, and there are grounds for the question: what can prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?” the newspaper said, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, the parent company of CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news site.
He said the new media court “will always be biased because it is an extension of the government” and that restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope that the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and return it to the deputies,” he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new law would essentially allow the government to “take the media to the dead end,” and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had “taken a serious hit” and criticized the bill as “draconian.”
The bill is part of measures taken to strengthen national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at Westgate shopping mall.
Kenyan media have angered authorities by broadcasting surveillance footage where troops who were sent to the site of the attack are believed to be looting an expensive shopping mall.
Police Chief David Kimayo's response was to call two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the call was cancelled after mass media protests.
Under the new law, publishers can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists up to one million with an additional risk of being “excluded from the lists”, that is, banned from obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the offender's property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one fine is enough to paralyze most FM radio stations.”
She also said the measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya’s so-called “revitalized blogosphere.”
Politicians understand that by silencing the media, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Matthew, describing Kenyan media as a key source of deterrent and balancing forces in public life.
“The politicians left to themselves will ruin the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to scrap the cuts set by the National Wage Commission and restore their huge salary of about 532,000 shillings a month, tax-free, one of the highest in the world.
In the utility bills of Voronezh residents there will be a new line of expenses - deductions for major repairs of the house.
According to the most approximate calculations for a standard two-room apartment from the new year will have to pay from 100 to 400 rubles per month.
The exact standard will be determined by the government of the region.
But when to paint the entrance, put the stairwells in order or even replace the elevator - the tenants themselves will decide.
This law was approved by the deputies of the regional Duma.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, noted: "In this case, too, it is necessary to restore order - to establish the order of repair of houses, to accumulate funds not in management companies - which we often register in Moscow, then in Orenburg, then somewhere else, it will be the establishment of state control over the spending of funds that residents collect for the repair of apartment buildings."
Under the control of the state now share construction.
The law, which protects against fraudsters, is approved by the regional Duma in the final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, 4.5 thousand people were affected by dishonest developers.
Most of the problems have been solved.
By the way, the new law prescribes rights and obligations for all participants in shared construction.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh regional Duma, said: "It is no secret that in this area also began abuses related to the fact that in 98-m year the same shareholders got, and in 2000-ies the same shareholders."
People began to make money on it to cover the loophole, including adopting these two laws.
Under Voronezh, it was decided to build a temporary residence center for foreign citizens subject to deportation.
The regional parliament passed such a law not only under the pressure of the federation.
The problems of illegal migrants in the region are at least solved.
So, last year, a little more than 100 thousand foreigners took part in the migration registration.
Only one in five people have a work permit.
Where others work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh regional Duma, said: "They violated the law, but they are not criminals."
There is no court, and they must be deported - they must be kept somewhere.
Such a decision the Federation decided that at the expense of regional funds to equip such places.
In the Voronezh region, such a place is defined - this is the Old Olshanka of the Semiluk district.
Well, finally, the regional parliament gave new privileges to large parents.
First, families raising 5 or more children are completely exempt from the transport tax.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million - but the same savings and large parents.
Secondly, and this is the main thing, those who adopt 3 or more babies will be given housing subsidies from the new year.
For each family member, the new law provides for 18 square meters, at a price of 30 thousand per meter.
The family, for example, of 6 people - dad, mother, child and 3 - adopted.
For them, according to the regulations, the state acquires housing area of 108 square meters - for 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left bank or the South-West microdistrict is quite an acceptable option.
Well, in the district center for this amount you can buy a whole cottage.

US Secretary of State: intelligence agencies sometimes “went too far” when collecting data
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that when collecting data and wiretapping, U.S. intelligence agencies sometimes “went too far”, however, the politician noted that the information appeared in the media about the wiretapping of 70 million people is not true.
I assure you that innocent people were not harmed in the process, but there was an attempt to gather information.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was illegal.
I recognize that, as the president recognizes... and we will make sure that doesn’t happen in the future,” he said.
Italian workers with seniority give way to young people
Italian unemployment is breaking records.
Data released on Wednesday showed that 12.5% of the country’s population is now out of work.
Things have not been so bad since World War II.
Among young people, this figure is several times higher.
40.4% of the population aged 15 to 24 are unemployed.
According to the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is early retirement of older workers.
Such an experiment is already conducted by the largest energy company in the country, and the adopted laws allow the regional authorities to provide a part of the early pension for workers with seniority.
However, on the other hand, Italy is waiting for a common problem for Europe’s aging population.
And economists are not sure that the idea of premature rotation of personnel will justify itself.
What will lead to the construction of TPU in Moscow
Every year, the capital authorities promise to equip more and more transport and interchange nodes (TPU).
By 2020, it is planned to put into operation 255 TPU.
What the project actually turns out to be, our correspondent understood.
A couple of months ago, a construction fence arose near the metro "Smolenskaya" of the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line.
The inscription said that the arrangement of the transport and transfer hub was underway.
All this was very strange, because next to the "Smolensk" no land transport stops and, therefore, it is impossible to transfer to it.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stop at the Garden Ring, you need to overcome about 130 meters, including a land passage through Karmanitsky Lane.
Now Smolenskaya is almost finished.
The flower stall disappeared, the stand for newspapers was dismantled, and the asphalt in front of the entrance was replaced with paving stones.
That's the whole transport hub.
Transport and interchange nodes are flat and capital, - explained in the press service of the capital's Department of transport.
There's no capital TPU yet.
A flat suggest the construction of parking lots, the withdrawal of commercial facilities that interfere with the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and landscaping.
In fact, flat TPU is not even engaged in transporters, but professional landscapers from the capital repair department of the city of Moscow.
The transport hub is not necessarily a complex structure,” explains Mikhail Blinkin, director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy at the Higher School of Economics.
Sometimes there is enough roof over the head and a board, notifying about the time of arrival of transport.
Here, for example, the metro "Yasenevo" recently opened a full-fledged flat junction.
No canopies, but with intercepting parking lots and a sign indicating when the bus will arrive.
But in pursuit of the number of officials write down in the TPU everything that gets.
Back in 2011, the mayor’s office planned to build all 151 units, 59 of them with capital construction.
There are now as many as 255 TPUs in the plans until 2020.
One and a half hundred of them promise to pass this year.
Although the city has a program for the development of TPU, no quality criteria are indicated, - says Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization "City and Transport".
The number of objects is reported, but the quality of the transplant on each of them often deteriorates.
The criteria, according to the expert, should be two: firstly - a reduction in the time of transplantation, and secondly - convenience.
First of all, the ability to change the mode of transport without going out in the rain.
In Moscow, when arranging TPU, sometimes it turns out exactly the opposite.
A vivid example of the metro "VDNH".
Previously, suburban buses from the Yaroslavl highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the VVC.
Now their stops were moved to the opposite side of Yaroslavka to the Kosmonavtov street.
Further from the metro, much further from the monorail, but closer to residential buildings.
It is a gift that the residents absolutely did not want a bus station under the windows and complained to all possible instances.
With capital TPU in Moscow somehow did not immediately ask.
The first of them began to build five years ago near the metro "Planernaya".
The project was meant to be exemplary.
And it really turned out to be a sample of how the transfer node, given as a ransom to investors, turns into a banal shopping center.
No, there are bus platforms, a shed to keep out the rain, and three floors of parking lots.
However, the Khimki trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 in the Moscow TPU did not give a place in principle.
Like strangers, they were pushed away from the subway.
There is still room for trade.
Only 32 clothing stores, and in general there is almost everything - from pet products to car dealerships.
Well, really, what if one of the bus passengers needs to buy a new car on the road?
For some reason, when we build a capital TPU, we always get a shopping center.
Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion, when part of the parking lot was decided to be given to the market.
Now on the third floor of the TPU "Planernaya" among the marked on the floor parking spaces there is a buoyant trade.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech and security guards looking at our photographer.
The transfer node has finally turned into a bazaar.
The fact is that earlier the metro "Planernaya" had a market, but it was demolished.
And in the prefecture, the merchants regretted it and were allowed to enter the intercepting parking of the transfer hub.
Because of the high prices, it is always empty.
The funniest thing is that the market was demolished in order to build in its place... a new flat TPU.
That's the castling.
At the metro "Kaluzhskaya" the access distance from the metro lobby to the bus was 50 meters, - says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the shopping center, allegedly TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the entire shopping center.
After 22 hours, when it is closed, you have to go around it in the open air.
However, the designs on "Planernaya" and "Kaluzhskaya" will soon appear as flowers.
In mid-September, the City and Land Planning Commission of the City Hall approved the planning decisions for the first eight capital TPUs.
Four of them will be 25-storey, not counting two or three underground tiers.
The main monster will grow near the Tushino metro station, it will have 418.7 thousand square meters of area.
Representatives of the directorate of railway stations of the Russian Railways, responsible for the construction of the TPU near the metro, have already told reporters: in future high-rise buildings will be located shops, hotels and apartments.
At the same time, officials assure that multi-storey parking lots are tainted from a third to a half of the area.
Take, for example, the “people’s” garage.
For example, a garage for 258 cars, which was recently built on International Street, has an area of 8015 square meters. meters.
So, for parking for 2.6 thousand cars from "Petrovsko-Razumovskaya" will need about 80 thousand "squares".
That's less than a third of the machine they're going to build there.
Let one or two floors go to all sorts of platforms for buses.
There are at least 150,000 square meters of commercial real estate.
And this is, for a minute, almost two GUM.
If the railway workers build capital TPU at stations and stations, then the rest of the sites will be mastered by metromen.
They also promised that there would be many “functional facilities”, including hotels, offices and even gyms.
By the way, the property department of the city of Moscow recently told journalists that they are developing a draft resolution according to which investors will be able to apply for a plot for TPU to officials directly.
Without any competitions.
Therefore, they say that transport issues for the city are a priority.
The ideal TPU is, for example, the Harvard station in Boston or Spadaina in Toronto, - Alexander Morozov is sure.
There, trolleybuses and trams descend underground to the subway level and the access distance from the subway car to the tram is only 50 meters without access to the street.
There is no extra trade.
But Moscow officials are thrown to the extreme.
Either we will not build anything, or we will tear down 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Esser proposes to equate to extremism the insult of patriotic feelings
In order to legally protect the patriotic feelings of citizens from provocations and insults directed against Russia, Fair Russia proposes to equate the insult of patriotic feelings with extremist activity and to punish for this with five years in prison.
According to the newspaper "Izvestia", such amendments to the legislation, prepared by the Deputy Chairman of the Duma Committee on Energy Oleg Mikheev, have already been sent to obtain an opinion in the Supreme Court and the government.
Under the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional connection of a person with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for this country, responsible attitude to its fate, respect for its history and culture.
As Mikheev points out, in the domestic legislation there are sanctions for abuse of formal signs of state power - the flag and the coat of arms.
At the same time, according to the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians, whose feelings can be hurt by insulting state symbols and other manifestations of disrespect for our country, has not been sufficiently elaborated in Russian legislation.
As an example, he cites the discussions that unfold annually on the eve of Victory Day, when some media persons allow themselves to question the heroic feat of the people of the USSR in the fight against the Nazis.
On the eve of the main national holiday - Victory Day on May 9 - a real bacchanalia unfolds annually.
Practicing wit and an “alternative view” of history, some publicists come to the conclusion that it is a pity that the cultural Germans did not conquer the wild Soviet Union!
I consider this absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main "spiritual bond" of the nation," - outrages Oleg Mikheev.
In addition, according to Mikheev, there are much more patriotic people in Russia than religious, but the law punishes for insulting the feelings of believers, and it is possible to insult patriotic feelings almost with impunity.
According to the MP, it is necessary to equate the insult of patriotic feelings with extremist activities and to prescribe an appropriate punishment in Article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides for punishment for insulting patriotic feelings: from a 100,000 fine to a five-year sentence.
An earthquake of magnitude 6.6 occurred on Thursday, October 31, in the city of Coquimbo in central Chile, reports Reuters.
The focus of the earthquake was in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and at a distance of 54 kilometers southwest of the city, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said on its website.
The tremors were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 on November 1 in Moscow).
The victims or the destruction caused by the tremors have not yet been reported.
Recall that Chile is located in one of the most seismically active areas of the Earth, so earthquakes of varying strength are not uncommon there.
One of the most serious things happened in 2010.
The 8.8-magnitude earthquake and the resulting tsunami killed more than 550 people and destroyed 220,000 buildings in Chile.
In addition, Chile had the most powerful earthquake in recent history: in 1960, there was recorded a magnitude of 9.5.
As a result of this natural disaster, more than five thousand people died.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace case will be considered fairly
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists will be considered in strict accordance with Russian law.
France can be sure that the case will be conducted in compliance with the law, we hear all the concerns.
“We can guarantee compliance with the law,” Medvedev said at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.
Among the detained Greenpeace activists is a French citizen.
Pierre Pisan, like other activists, was charged with hooliganism.
“I asked whether we can expect a humanitarian gesture in relation to the detained citizen,” RIA Novosti quoted Mr. Ayrault as saying.
“Our country cannot support activities that can cause damage to the environment, no one has the right to violate the laws,” Medvedev said.
According to him, the activities of any structures that try to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy production, are dangerous.
He stressed that these objects are “like a powder keg”, and recalled what was happening in the Gulf of Mexico, RIA Novosti reported.
The United Nations has set new goals for poverty alleviation.
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty worldwide.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in advancing the “Sustainable Development Goals” to replace the MDGs, which are due to expire in 2015, ahead of the UN summit on sustainable development, which began in Rio de Janeiro the night before.
They were included in the final version of the document, which will be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit that now was the time to “go beyond national interests.”
“I am glad that the UN member states have agreed to launch and take control of the process of creating universal sustainable development goals – the SDGs,” he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development vision.
I will make every effort to use the powers given to me by the member countries to realize our vision of sustainable development goals, which are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Concerns about security in Mozambique are growing due to the conflict of influential people
Under a top-down statue of Mozambique’s founding president, Zamora Machel, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to chant slogans about peace at one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of the investment firm.
Fearing for her country’s future, she changed her business suit to a T-shirt emblazoned with “We demand security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd at Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there were almost daily reports of clashes between government troops and Renamo, one of the most violent clashes since the armistice was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a well-known insurgent movement that was supported first by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the apartheid-era government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country’s independent government.
After the 1992 armistice, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to slide back into full-scale conflict, but recent events have made foreign investors and local residents nervous.
The stakes are high for a fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal fields in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling Frelimo party, a leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo party accuse each other of creating tensions.
Renamo's party claims that the government was the instigator of the latest clashes, attacking its members in Sofala province, the traditional Renamo stronghold, on October 17.
Attacks on former rebels then escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, Fernando Mazanga, a spokesman for Renamo, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armandu Gebuza has sought to allay fears of instability.
Gebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama felt like a “loser” who wanted to use “all that is left of his strength to try to prove that he can impose his own decisions on the government.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, concerns grew after reports that Mazanga had announced Renamo's rejection of the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he was referring to Frelimo’s non-compliance with the agreement.
“Our goal is to get back to negotiations, but in all seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions, which have been exacerbated by a series of clashes this year.
“These are two influential people (Gebuza and Dhlakama) who collided with their foreheads,” said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them are good negotiators and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo's party, which is trying to push through electoral reforms, has already said it will boycott municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The share of votes for Renamo has been declining since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was founded by a former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in this election.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebuza, who was due to step down next year when his second term ended, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want a multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what Renamo's capabilities are, but it has already carried out devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on a key highway leading from north to south.
Most of the skirmishes took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but includes Beira, a port that mining companies including Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railway tracks for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazanga was evasive when asked if Renamo would repeat the threat.
Renamo’s party wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going very well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has fueled discontent with the government, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent increase in kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop.
“People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies with the government and the president, who must find a solution to these problems,” he says.
Omar Sultan, a participant in the demonstration, said people just want stability.
“Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want a renewal of the world, they want free access to the roads,” he said.
The series of premiere film screenings "Art-mainstream" will be held in Moscow
A series of film screenings "Art-mainstream", where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their release, will be held in the cinema "Rolan" from 1 to 5 November, RIA "Novosti" reports with reference to the organizers of the project.
The program "Art-mainstream" will open the French comedy director and actress Reim Kerici "Paris at any price".
This is the story of a model working in the French capital, Maya (Kerichi herself), who is deported to Morocco due to problems with her visa.
In addition to the Kerichi film, viewers will also be shown a new film by the famous South Korean director Kim Ki-duk "Mebius", melodramatic biopic by Oliver Hirschbigel "Diana: a love story" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the title role and the main film of the Cannes film festival "Life of Abdel" held in May.
The only Russian participant of the "Art-mainstream" will be the film won at the festival "Kinotavr" by Alexander Veledinsky "Geographer of the globe drank" based on the novel of the same name by Alexei Ivanov.
The main role - the charming loser-teacher Viktor Sluzhkin - in the film was played by Konstantin Khabensky, whose work was also awarded the Kinotavr prize.
Children should study myths and legends as “lifestyle models,” says the author.
The tales of the Torah could show that “rough power cannot defeat subtle cunning,” and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many myths would be “too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene to teach in schools,” Crossley-Holland advocates “careful selection” of age-appropriate texts.
“I think it’s wonderful that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been advocating for them to be introduced to the curriculum for twenty years.
He added that “excessive moralizing” of authors and teachers “takes away interest” in children, and the main ideas are “sublimated” into fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon, and also wrote The Collection of Norwegian Myths for Penguin and British Folk Tales, said, “You may have intentions, but you’d better keep them to yourself.”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but it is necessary that there is an innate understanding of good and evil.
And this must be sublimated; revealed through history, not clearly articulated.
The old principle is to show, not to tell.
In the Voronezh region detained a football fan who broke a window in the waiting room of the station
At nine o’clock in the evening of October 29, at the Gryazi-Voronezh station, transport police officers removed two football fans from a passenger train – natives of the Moscow region.
Going to the game of the favorite team, the guys on the way staged a drunken deboss on the train.
The young people were taken to the duty station of the police line office at the Gryazi station to draw up a protocol on an administrative offence.
There the fans repented of their anti-social behavior.
The police issued them with administrative material and released them.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and at the station began to wait for his arrival.
In the middle of the first night, fans left the building of the railway station, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly returned and broke the window of the entrance door in the waiting room of the station.
At the sound of the broken glass rushed the transport police officer and the guard of the CHOP "Russian Railways".
They managed to arrest the attacker who was trying to escape from the scene.
Employees of the South-Eastern Lu Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia is being checked.
The issue of initiating a criminal case is being resolved, said Sergey Olkhovik, senior officer of the information and public relations department of the South-Eastern Lu Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia on transport.
Vitaly Mutko: Water cannons?
I think we went back 15 years.
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion about the riots in the stands during the match of the Cup of Russia "Shinnik" - "Spartak".
I am a supporter of the fact that the organizers of sports events are responsible for all this: clubs, the league, the RFU.
But we see that they have taken a different position.
They expect someone from the outside to come and clean it up.
This is a very good position, but not quite the right one.
It is necessary to organize fans, clubs should invite their stewards, and not let the business go by itself.
We have now developed a special government regulation on the rules of conduct in stadiums.
Once it is adopted, we will deal with this issue closely.
But I will definitely invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read an interview with Leonid Fedun.
The state, they say, let's make the law faster.
It seems that it was the Bavarian fans who came to Yaroslavl and arranged it all.
We are outside observers.
In general, it is terrible to see how the tribune is watered from the brandspout.
And this is in a country that is preparing for the World Cup.
“I feel like we’re back 10-15 years ago,” Mutko said.
Snowden could be interrogated in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence official Edward Snowden is unlikely to travel outside Russia to testify in cases involving wiretapping of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone conversations.
As a source familiar with the situation told Interfax on Friday, the American can answer questions from representatives of the German Prosecutor General’s Office in writing or face-to-face in Russia.
The departure of Edward Snowden from Russia is almost impossible.
"In this case, he will lose his refugee status and can be extradited to Washington by countries that are allies of the United States," the source said.
"At the same time, in principle, the Prosecutor General's Office of Germany could send its representatives to the Russian Federation or hand over written questions to Snowden," the source added, adding that this issue should be worked out at the interstate level.
Earlier, the deputy of the German Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebele said that Edward Snowden is ready to testify in the case of wiretapping by the American special services of the negotiations of the German Chancellor.
Snowden is ready to testify to German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow or in Germany.
The ex-CIA officer made it clear that he knew a lot.
Despite the fact that the US NSA blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, for this it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival," Strebele told Euronews TV channel.
Snowden's lawyer Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on the statement of the source of "Interfax", said that his client can cooperate with German investigators, but when and how - will decide on his own.
US citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he published information about secret operations of US special services on Internet surveillance.
Snowden flew through Moscow in transit, but was unable to leave the airport due to the fact that his passport was canceled by the US authorities, who in absentia presented him with serious charges, and until early August remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport.
On August 1, Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum in Russia for a year and left Sheremetyevo on the same day.
Yesterday, the American lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said that his client got a job in a “large Russian company”.
German media reported on the NSA surveillance of Angela Merkel last week.
According to journalists, the telephone conversations of the Chancellor, the Americans began to listen in 2002.
The surveillance station was allegedly located at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
German authorities, after the publication of this information, said that surveillance of Merkel violates the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
Ponomarev left "Fair Russia"
The deputy of the State Duma from the party "Fair Russia", a member of its branch in Novosibirsk Ilya Ponomarev filed an application for withdrawal from the political organization.
According to the parliamentarian, he submitted the statement to the Novosibirsk regional branch of the party.
According to its charter, this automatically means that Ponomarev left the ranks of the "spravedross".
We sit, we drink tea...
"For some reason, many want to see the picture "Ilia Ponomarev puts a party ticket on the table," but there is nothing so epochal about it," the deputy commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintains good relations with the regional branch of the SS.
Meanwhile, the mandate of the State Duma Deputy Ilya Ponomarev does not intend to refuse.
He explained that despite leaving the party, he remains a member of the faction and by law cannot leave it.
Reports about Ilya Ponomarev's intention to leave the party "Fair Russia" appeared on October 30.
It was reported that Dmitry Gudkov and Valery Zubov would leave SR with him, but the latter soon denied this information.
Japan will discuss with Russia the issue of concluding a peace treaty
Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"We would like to openly exchange views on the further development of political dialogue, discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty," Kysida said at the meeting.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between the countries became warmer and became bilateral.
The Russian minister, in turn, noted that Russia will meet Japan in solving complex political issues.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the issue of the disputed Northern territories.
In this regard, Tokyo today held a protest to demand the return of the country lost after the Second World War land.
In the Japanese capital, cars drive, from which the loudspeaker says: "Return the northern territories!".
The police do not stop the protesters, they make sure that the noise level is not exceeded.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It is safe to say that New York is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a century ago, pop artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conference host at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.
Fey's innovation over time was picked up by others, most recently, the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and curated by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these headliners started at Carolines and then had more success, reaching a level where they’re already too famous to perform at the club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year’s event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Katie Griffin, and Bill Mara, as well as Standup for Heroes, an annual music-comedy benefit concert for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby among others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy expanded.
Several of the comedians participating in the festival this year have gained popularity in an unconventional way, for example, thanks to shows on small TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll gained fame for his role in the comedy series on a little-known cable TV channel (especially the ragged “League” on FXX on the theme of fantasy football), and now leads his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate joined the cast in both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for her viral series Marseilles - Shell in Boots.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with distinctive style (surrealistically pessimistic Anthony Jesselnik, cunning, focused on the racial theme of Kamau Bell), are the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be David Steinberg’s interview with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but later became a successful director on television and in film, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held at the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“This city is certainly a central element of all of Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he comes here, he sometimes walks along some street between two houses and thinks: “If I am left completely without money, maybe I will live here.”
Pakistani authorities begin talks with local Taliban
The Pakistani government has begun talks with the Taliban.
This was reported by the Embassy of this country in the UK, where the Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif is on a visit.
The head of the Pakistani government made a statement about talks with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed Pakistan-India relations, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The prime minister has announced that dialogue with the Taliban has begun," Pakistan's embassy in London said in a statement.
"He said he hopes and prays that the dialogue will work in accordance with Pakistan's constitution," the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the Afghan movement of the same name, but operate independently in the northwestern areas of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are trying to create an Islamic state.
Earlier, the government of Islamabad tried to start negotiations with the local Taliban, but the movement refused to dialogue.
It said it would only negotiate if the authorities withdrew troops stationed in areas where the Taliban were active and released the arrested Islamists from prison.
Nawaz Sharif arrived in London for the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, October 29, British Prime Minister David Cameron, the head of the Pakistani government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a trilateral meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil fell in price to $96 per barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about the formation of large reserves overshadowed a report showing that China’s energy-intensive manufacturing sector is gaining strength.
The benchmark grade of U.S. oil in December supply fell by 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 per barrel later in the morning European time in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract fell by 39 cents, which in total amounted to a fall in the price of October by 5.8 percent.
Rich oil reserves have affected its value in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. stockpiles have increased by 4.1 million barrels over the past week.
In five weeks, the reserves were replenished by more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, according to two reports of Chinese industry showing a surge in its activity.
This indicates that China’s economic recovery may continue to pick up strength after its third-quarter growth rate rose to 7.8 percent from a 20-year low in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark grade of international oil also used by U.S. refiners, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
The head coach of “Colorado” Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release goalkeeper Semyon Varlamov from the first minutes in Friday’s match with “Dallas”, expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars did not shake his confidence in the Russian, reports from Dallas sobkor “SE” Natalia Shmeleva.
“What are we waiting for?” said Rua after the morning roll of Lavin.
Of course, what happened worries us all, but we are confident in him and feel that it will be useful for him to go out on the ice today.
We want him to come out on the ice and show his usual level.
So you are absolutely sure that the situation did not affect the conditions of the goalkeeper?
We'll see today.
Undoubtedly, our players will support Varley by helping him guard the goal, as it was in previous matches this season.
The main thing is that no one in the team is going to draw any conclusions until the court understands this situation.
In Siberia, you should not be vegan: greenhouse tomato will not replace soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, found out the correspondent of RIA Novosti.
People who have completely abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here they can not endure the winter without loss of health, and no greenhouse tomatoes do not compensate them, according to Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors interviewed on the eve of Vegan Day.
Drink oil in liters
Strict vegetarianism, when they refuse not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, nutritionists believe that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia to adhere to such strict norms in nutrition, at least, is not healthy.
A complete rejection of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain essential amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate with vegetable ones.
It is necessary to include at least milk or eggs in the diet," says dietitian Marina Bogay.
She cites the example of fish containing the essential fatty acid Omega-3.
The richest vegetable oil is flaxseed.
"In order to consume it in the quantities necessary for a person, you need to drink liters!" - says the nutritionist.
Doctors believe that the inhabitants of Siberia should pay special attention to the diet in winter.
In this season, vegetarianism is especially questioned.
In the conditions of our realities, there are high requirements for food.
In order not to freeze, you need increased caloric content.
"If a person limits himself on animal products, respectively, he does not get enough of this caloric content," the specialist says.
Dietitian Olga Poznyak agrees with this.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not the way out.
It is better for a person to eat mainly foods that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is tuned to better digest and digest these foods.
And in winter, people do not want to bite a cucumber, but a hot soup or something more filling,” the doctor explains his position.
According to her, from the fact that vegans can eat, various cereals, cereals, legumes, local vegetables, apples remaining in the winter, frozen berries are really useful.
But this is definitely not enough for a full meal.
According to the doctor-gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, Siberians have sufficient levels of vitamins in their bodies only from mid-August to mid-September.
A complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees per day and in May the snow is lying, is inexpedient.
The body needs energy for life, and this, first of all, fat," the doctor says.
Doctors note that veganism is especially harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children are growing up, they need building material, including in the form of amino acids.
And by sticking to vegetarianism, we give them inferior.
Pregnant women also need an increased content of protein, vitamins and trace elements in the menu.
“Vegans don’t get them,” God says.
Arifulina says that an adult is free to choose whatever he wants, “to play with whatever toys he wants.”
He has already formed an organism, a skeleton, organs.
And the children still need to eat full.
If parents deprive him of some trace elements or amino acids, choosing for him what he will eat, it is simply a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of certain substances for the development of the brain, vision, bones will not be restored tomorrow," she says.
All interviewed medical specialists agree on the low quality grown in winter in greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruits.
What is brought to us and grown in greenhouses, contains less microelements necessary for us than (grown) in open ground.
"The quality of the products is not the same," says Bogay.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to collect a larger harvest is detrimental to quality.
"Apples do not turn brown at the cut, cucumbers quickly turn yellow and moldy, tomatoes are tasteless and unflavored," the medics cite examples, adding that they are most likely stuffed with excess fertilizer.
And they become suppliers not of vitamins, but of fiber.
With this I do not agree with the laboratory of the Siberian Physical and Technical Institute of Agrarian Problems, the candidate of agricultural sciences Vera Petruk.
She says that with the right approach and compliance with all norms and requirements in greenhouses, it is possible to grow full-fledged vegetables.
If they try to expel more from a square meter, then, of course, watering will become more frequent, and overfeed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when there are too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow quickly, they are large, but watery and unsweetened," she explains, adding that the issue of quality, first of all, depends on the conscience of the manufacturer.
The court suspended the execution of the decision on the practice of “stop-and-search” in the New York Department of police
On Thursday, the Federal District Court of Appeals suspended enforcement of a court order requiring changes to the NYPD’s “stop-and-search” program and removed the judge from the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said the enforcement of Judge Sheera Sheindlin’s rulings would be suspended pending the results of the appeal filed by the city.
In August, a judge ruled that the city had violated the constitution in the way it carried out a program of street arrests and interrogations.
The city filed an appeal against her decision and the corrective action orders, including an order to appoint a supervisor to help the police department change its work practices and related training program.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard the parties' debate on the motion to stay the case.
The appeals court said it needed to dismiss the judge because she violated the U.S. judge’s code of conduct and did not consider it necessary to avoid showing bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to the court’s criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unreasonably appealing to blacks and Latinos under the “stop-and-search” program.
It has appointed an external controller to oversee sweeping changes that include policy, training and control reforms, and has decided to launch a pilot program to test body-mounted video cameras in police stations where most arrests take place.
In August, New York decided to stop the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were terminated after a police check.
The city's appeal hearing is due to take place after March 14, 2014.
The “stop and search” tactic has been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
Stop-and-search has been practiced in some form for decades, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 people in 2011, most of whom are black and Latino.
In 2004, four individuals, all from national minorities, filed a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the Stop-and-Search program in the New York Police Department say the changes would put an end to unfair practices, create a more reliable and efficient police service, and could affect how other police departments implement the practice.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce the morale of police officers, not the crime rate, will lead to unnecessary waste of money and will not solve the more global problem of difficult conditions in the police due to the reduction in the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she does not stop the “stop-and-search” practice, which is in line with the constitution, but changes the way the NYPD stops people.
In the area of the Tretyakov Gallery opened a pedestrian zone
A new pedestrian zone has appeared in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Tretyakov Gallery and occupies a plot of two kilometers from the metro station "Novokuznetskaya" to Bolotnaya Square.
Street floor lamps, flowerpots, benches, urns and toilets were installed throughout, deaf fences and illegal advertising were removed.
In addition to Klimentovsky and Lavrushinsky lanes, which were already pedestrian, five streets were closed to cars - Ordynsky dead end, Big and Small Tolmachevskiy lanes, Kadashevskaya embankment and Bolotnaya square.
Traffic on the streets of Maroseyka and Petrovka is not limited.
On the section of Pyatnitsky street from the lobby of the station "Novokuznetskaya" to Klimentovsky lane conditions for pedestrians created without removing traffic and cutting the roadway, reports newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Tretyakov Gallery, the Church of St. Clement of Rome, museums, libraries, monuments and other attractions.
Previously, the Tver Passage, Stoleshnikov Lane and Kuznetsky Most Street became completely pedestrian.
Bolshaya Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, it was decided to close for cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson resorted to hacking the phone to check the confidential message
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm false information about the novel by Charles Clarke, who was then the interior minister.
The prosecutor, Andrew Addis, told the Old Bailey court that in May 2005 the News of the World had received untrue news that Clark was meeting with his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Polby.
The newspaper instructed private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Polby’s voicemail and keep her at home to interview her, but Coulson also called her and left voice messages.
“The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who would stand outside someone’s house hoping to catch someone by surprise, he’s the kind of person who likes to offer a story to people to see what they say,” Mr. Addis said.
He said the News of the World newspaper used three ways to investigate the stories: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, about surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hack?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yes!"
Rumors of Clarke's novel first caught the attention of News of the World when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby was told, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A tape of voice messages received from her phone at least three times was seized from Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on the computer of a private detective, in which Ms. Polby and her sister appeared as "Projects".
During the period when she was under surveillance, Ms. Polby’s grandmother and grandfather received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis said.
At this time, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weserap were monitoring Ms. Polby's movements.
Leaving her a voice message on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story we plan to publish tomorrow that I would very much like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Addis said that Coulson’s involvement in the story followed the same scenario as that of other influential people, such as former Home Secretary David Blankett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had engaged in a confrontation with Mr. Blankett over an affair with a married woman while he was dating the defendant, Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny colluding with others to break into their phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weserap have admitted to hacking their phones.
Snowden says he is ready to talk to the authorities of Germany in the case of wiretapping
Former CIA officer Edward Snowden is ready to come to Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity to do so, and meet with representatives of the German authorities, RIA Novosti reports.
A letter from a former CIA officer to the German authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented by Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Strebele, through whom Snowden conveyed a message to the German authorities.
Strebel met with Snowden in Moscow the day before.
As a result of the fire on Tverskaya street injured four people
As a result of the fire in the collector in the center of Moscow, on Tverskaya Street, four passers-by were injured.
According to Interfax, citing a source in the emergency services, one of the victims was hospitalized.
According to the source, injured passers-by who were during the fire in the smoky underground passage.
According to RIA Novosti with reference to the head of the capital's Department of fuel and energy management Pavel Livinsky, currently in all houses on Tverskaya street completely restored power supply.
A fire in a heat collector near the house 15 on Tverskaya Street occurred on the evening of October 31.
Heavy smoke came from the storm drain hatches, and smoke formed in the underground passage, located near the Armenia store.
As a result of the fire, 11 houses on Tverskaya Street were de-energized.
At 21:45 Moscow time the fire was extinguished.
U.S. cuts food allowance for poor
The food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $ 36 per month
Since Friday, the financial security of food stamps, known as “food stamps”, has been reduced in the United States, as the relevant state program expires.
A family of four will now receive $36 less per month in food allowance than before, officials say.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in the 2012 fiscal year, the allowance per person was an average of $133 per month.
U.S. food aid spending has soared to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
About 14 percent of Americans rely on free food aid issued by “food stamps,” which have been called food stamps since the days when they were in the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the program was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
Republicans in Congress, however, are demanding further cuts to the program, saying it should be aimed at helping those who need it most.
Food store owners across America worry that the cuts will reduce consumer spending.
U.S. lawmakers continue to argue about how to further cut government funding.
Blizzard has released a free 19-year-old platformer
Blizzard released its 1994 platformer Blackthorne for free on PC.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to him, the game became available on Battle.net in the section of classic games Blizzard.
However, some gamers note that at present it can be downloaded only by those users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service.
For Russian users, the game is not available yet.
As reported by the media, the version that Blizzard has now released on PC, outwardly does not differ from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack for Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platformer, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, originally came out on the SNES console.
Its events unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light kingdoms.
Once the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the bright King Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main character of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was saved from death by being sent to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Toul to fight Sarlak's henchmen and protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game that the studio released after its rebranding as Blizzard Entertainment.
Previously, it was called Silicon & Synapse.
The publisher of Blackthorne was Interplay.
In the Moscow metro there will be new machines.
But they will sell tickets to passengers not for money, but for squats.
One trip worth 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger in 30 seats.
The number of squats will be calculated by a special device with the help of modern technologies, ITAR-TASS reports with reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first device will be installed at the Exhibition Station on November 8, 2013.
The presentation of the new ticketed athletes will be attended by the President of the Olympic Committee of Russia Alexander Zhukov and Olympic gymnasts Alexey Nemov and Elena Zamolodchikova.
National Security Agency confessions increase corporate paranoia over state surveillance
On a warm afternoon in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital.
According to the instructions of the Federal Service for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany’s internal intelligence service, his task was to photograph the roof of the US embassy building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hoped to detect the antennas of the listening devices, and these actions led to talks between the U.S. and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, again assured in September that the U.S. was not using foreign intelligence capabilities “to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies in the interests of U.S. companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But ever since Edward Snowden — the contract officer who became the whistleblower — began publishing his treasure trove of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and company executives are no longer sure if the director can be trusted to keep his word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency was monitoring Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gaining access to data stored by U.S. cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised corporate paranoia caused by state surveillance to new heights.
The latest drop was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been tapped, perhaps for about a decade.
If Europe’s most powerful person could become a target, then, of course, business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden made clear the intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies.
I think it is quite likely that these data are being used with mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” says Oliver Gruen, president of BITMi, which represents Germany’s small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the U.S. now poses almost the same risk as China in industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by EY.
In all the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, however, there was still no evidence that the U.S. was passing on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain information technology and Internet capabilities, and suggested that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business owners are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament says that we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again.
“It’s not an option,” says Gasso Plattner, president of the German software company SAP.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
Yet the reach and technical sophistication of U.S. spy agencies, made famous by Snowden’s revelations, came as a shock to some companies that previously thought China posed the greatest risk of surveillance.
The big shift is happening in cloud technology, where European company executives are better aware that data stored in the U.S. is in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by the trade association Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of its non-U.S. participants abandoned plans to use the services of a U.S.-based cloud provider after the disclosure of the U.S. program for intelligent data analysis Prism.
Jim Sneeb, one of SAP’s chief executives, said: “We see consumers asking a new question that didn’t arise a year ago, namely where my data is stored and whether you can guarantee that they will physically remain in that jurisdiction.”
Many German leaders argue that the latest reports are just a confirmation of what they already knew: powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore, this data must be protected at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is not surprising.
It's always had a place.
“This has been a subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current controversy,” said Kurt Bock, chief executive officer of BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, and we are spying on them too, because it is in our national interest to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders usually do not like to boast about the retaliatory measures they have taken, as this can provide an advantage to the enemy.
In large companies, it has long been learned that taking a free flash drive at an exhibition or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is at least imprudent.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi’s board of directors, says it has been standard practice for many years to assemble mobile phones before board meetings so they can’t be used as listening devices.
Germany’s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution recommends that company executives consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during overseas travel due to smartphone vulnerabilities.
Prepaid mobile phones are then thrown away.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are world market leaders in their specific niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack the expertise, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,” the BfV report warns.
The U.S. is warning its own companies about economic espionage by other countries.
The U.S. national intelligence report in February placed France, along with Russia and Israel, in the second row of violators who engage in hacking for economic intelligence, after China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Scarsini, former head of France’s domestic intelligence agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: “The services are well aware that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies.”
Parents of Georgia teenager who died by 'ridiculous accident' believe their son was murdered
The parents of a Georgia teenager whose body was found inside a rolled-up sports mat in his high school gymnasium believe their son was murdered, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a upright mat leaning against the back of the stands in the gymnasium of his high school.
Investigators from the Loundes County Sheriff’s Department concluded that Johnson died by tragic accident, but the 17-year-old’s family disputes this.
“They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff says.
“They think it’s against logic, against the laws of physics, against common sense,” Crump said.
They think it's a cover to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he was returned to them in a body bag,” he said.
U.S. attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson’s death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What caused the death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made the statement at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I will examine all the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I am of the opinion that there are sufficient grounds” for a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy revealed that Johnson died as a result of “positional asphyxia.”
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, showed another cause of death.
“There are a few issues that need to be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to demand a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson’s death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
A spokesman for the Loundes County Sheriff’s Department was not available for comment when he was approached on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all CCTV footage that investigators had viewed.
The teenager’s parents said they hope the videos hold the key to figuring out how he died.
"Spartacus": For information about persons who posted fascist symbols
On the official website of "Spartacus" there was a statement of the Moscow club regarding the appearance of the fascist flag on the rostrum in Yaroslavl.
"At the Shinnik-Spartak Cup match on October 30, unknown provocateurs demonstrated fascist symbols at the stadium in Yaroslavl.
We appeal to all who have reliable information about the perpetrators of this criminal crime, with a request to provide it to the "security service of FC Spartak-Moscow" at the e-mail address fcsmsec<0x40>spartak.com.
“Remuneration is guaranteed,” the statement said.
We are looking for fans who hung a fascist flag in Yaroslavl
Recall that in the match of the 1/16 finals of the Cup of Russia "Shinnik" - "Spartak" was interrupted several times due to riots in the stands.
Also in the sector of fans of "Spartacus" was demonstrated fascist symbolism.
In the form of punishment, Spartak can hold about three matches without spectators.
There will be a committee meeting on Friday.
If you have information about who carried and hung this symbol, please contact us.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for schools regarding allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for controlling food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the U.S. government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is growing.
One out of every 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide provides information for schools on how to raise the awareness of teachers and staff about food allergies in children and how to help in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep a stockpile of epinephrine—most commonly an automatic medical syringe called EpiPen—to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures recently amended regulations to allow schools to stockpile adrenaline with less difficulty.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have had an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is sticking into my tongue,” “it feels like I have hair on my tongue,” or “the tongue is pinching.”
Parents of intersex children can choose ‘undefined gender’
Germany became the first European country to recognize a third gender in children born with external genitalia of the intermediate type.
Newborns will no longer necessarily be attributed to the male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to name any gender of such children, allowing parents to indicate gender as “unspecified” or “unspecified” on their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to relieve pressure on parents who can make hasty decisions about sex reassignment surgery for newborns, and to counteract discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex man, according to the BBC, said many years later, “I’m not a man or a woman.”
I will remain a doctor-made patchwork with bruises and scars.
About one in two thousand babies born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of "sexual development disorder" - a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or unusually developed external genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identity is still not well understood, but most experts in the U.S. say that if gender cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and assign it than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identity issues, said the new German law “sounds like a good idea.”
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening disorders that require surgery, but most children don’t,” he said.
You can assign a gender without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child develops any gender identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It's like a mystery about why people are homosexual.
The report, sent to the European Commission in 2011, describes intersex people as different from transgender or transgender people because their condition is not related to gender, but to their biological makeup, which is not exclusively male or female, and typically for both at the same time or is not characteristic of either of them.
These characteristics may be manifested in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breast and body composition; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and crimes based on prejudice.
Boys with gender differences now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to put male, female or “third gender” in their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Welby became the first person in the world to be recognized as “asexual”, defending in court the right to preserve the “undefined” sexual status for life.
According to the Interior Ministry, the German passports will use a third designation in addition to M and F-X, that is, intersex.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from France, a strongly Catholic country, signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The U.S. website Catholic Online also disagreed with German law, writing that “in a situation where the world is being dragged into a new state where gender is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we are turning over two more pillars of civilization.”
One mother of a newborn baby from Maryland also told the Baby Zone website that she would prefer that the babies be gendered at birth.
“Growing a baby is hard enough and without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your baby’s gender,” she told the website for parents.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites – after a beautiful Greek god who had signs of both sexes.
And just a decade ago, the medical community perceived gender as a sheet on which you can erase everything and then draw again.
But now many are challenging the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how a child will perceive the gender assigned to him when he grows up.
“In the mid-20th century, it was called an ‘emergency psychiatric case,’” Drescher said.
When these children were born, you didn’t call a psychiatrist — you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with intermediate-type genitalia was proposed by Dr. John Many of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was easy to change.
He coined the term “gender identity” and argued that environmental cues, including social cues — the way parents raise a child — interact with a child’s genes and hormones, determining whether a person will consider themselves male or female.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/Joan, his theories came into question.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged during careless circumcision to castrate the child completely, also removing his testicles, and raise him as a girl.
“Manny presented the case as a successful example of transition, but it wasn’t,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that now some doctors are still “applying this model.”
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who survived these sex-change operations declared themselves “unhappy with the result.”
That was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male XY chromosomes but intermediate-type genitals.
Doctors could not determine whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live a “full life” of a man.
Therefore, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce’s external genitalia and testicles were surgically removed and he was brought up as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was prescribed vaginoplasty.
But being depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he learned was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with impaired sexual development, which prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for the normal development of the genitals.
Learning the truth, he became a man again, getting testosterone injections and removing his breast.
The operation rendered him infertile.
Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of people with intersexuality.
But Ann Temar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law “encourages labeling and stigma.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make hasty decisions and give the child an ‘undetermined gender’,” she said.
We fear that he will facilitate the intervention.
We believe that it is better to assign a male or female sex, and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Temar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it "allows adults to make choices in favor of the third sex."
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal gender,” she says.
German law implies its appropriation at birth.
This is a battle that young children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Barac, a Pittsburgh-based mammologist-radiologist who has a daughter with a developmental disability and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said the German law would “support” both parents and children.
Barac’s daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual development disorder called “complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.”
Because her androgen receptors are not working properly, Katie has developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Now, at the age of 29, Kathy is married and doing a residency in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
“The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions on their own,” Barac said.
It gives them time to do some tests and sort out the situation, as well as a period of time before they write “male” or “female”.
In this case, you are fine - raise a child, love a child.
You have a wonderful child and you feel joy.
We don't need to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
“It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the excitement that drives parents because they don’t feel like they’re doing the right thing,” she said.
In the end, the child will decide which sex he or she is more comfortable with – and that’s great.
This gives children the opportunity to make their own decisions.
Chicago goalkeeper Nikolai Khabibulin stressed: he understands that he should play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two meetings of the Hawks, Khabibulin first missed six pucks from Tampa Bay, and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed puck.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I have not managed to do that,” CSNChicago said.
“I need to find confidence in training, maybe I should treat them as games and try to achieve a better result.
You should study your past games and work on the shortcomings that were.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in training I feel quite decent.
But for some reason, after a few heads, everything turns into some kind of snowball.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
The goalkeepers – I don’t think I’m the only one – always try to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not thrilled.
It doesn't matter what happens at my door.
I'm still working on myself not to miss so many pucks.
It’s great that my teammates support me, but in principle it’s simple: I have to play better.
Two games isn’t the whole season, but I wanted to make them a lot better.
But what happened happened.
I have to put this aside.
I’m just going to try to play the next game better.
In the Altai turned over the bus.
In the Rubtsovsky district of the Altai Territory turned over the PAZ bus.

Medvedev expects SSJ-100 to be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that after the consolidation in the markets of Latin America and Asia, Superjet 100 aircraft will be delivered to Europe.
“We expect that in total we will receive such agreements for more than 170 aircraft of this type,” Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said at a press conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.
The head of the Russian government noted that serious cooperation has been established with French colleagues, since this is a joint project.
We discussed some financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that after this aircraft is strengthened in the markets of Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
“I hope that it will someday be delivered to France,” the Russian prime minister stressed.
The SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by Sukhoi Civil Aircraft in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is designed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment of 100 passenger seats.
The power engineers of Dnipropetrovsk region have launched a unique program to save the nests of storks
In ancient times, in order to bring the storks to the court, the peasants on a high pole installed a cart wheel, and the heavy nest held well on it.
Such special supports have not been put for a long time, so the storks chose the poles of power lines - the interwoven branches are based on wires, so that the aistine house stands reliably.
Grandmother Anya, near the house of which in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovsky district for twenty years lives a true family, began to notice how the nest settles, despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds put new twigs on top, and the bottom layer has already passed between the wires, is about to collapse.
Of course, it is a pity for the family of storks, who every year nested in the yard, brought out and fed for the summer three or four chicks, but I do not want to remain without light.
As soon as the birds flew to the warm edges, Anya's grandmother called the Tsarichansky RES, which owns the support.
I didn’t expect them to react so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest is still standing at all, - said the technical director of DTEK "Dneprooblenergo" Sergey Berezovsky.
On the wires, which were, in fact, already inside the nest, weighing 150 - 200 kilograms, corrosion began.
At any moment, the birds could have died from an electric discharge.
And local residents risked being left without light due to damage to the wires.
Therefore, linear fitters began the operation to save the nest, and not for the first time in our practice.
Helped ornithologists from the Dnepropetrovsk National University, who developed a scheme for the transfer of the nest.
They also conducted trainings for employees of district networks.
The famous Dnepropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised power engineers at all stages of the reconstruction of nests.
To begin with, it was estimated that there are more than 50 truly “apartments” in the area in an emergency state.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms resembling a funnel were welded.
The base was braided with willow branches, and then the old nest was moved there.
According to experts, it is enough to lay the old branches as a basis for the birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
Later, the storks will complete their own housing.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka of the Novomoskovsk district.
Next to the electro-resistance put a new reinforced concrete pillar and placed on it a platform with an old, already inhabited nest.
The whole operation cost the power engineers nine thousand hryvnias.
And the other day the same housewarming took place in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovsky district in the yard of grandmother Ani.
Here, the platform was fixed in the same place, only raised above the wires.
Ornithologists are sure that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their "apartment" has undergone major repairs.
Until the end of the year, the same reconstruction expects four more nests in Pokrovsky and Tsarichansky districts of the Dnipropetrovsk region.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others mercilessly kill them.
The other day, the whole region flew around the sad news - in the village of Ust-Kamenka of the Apostolov district, on the day of the opening of the hunt for pheasants, poachers shot a swan family living on the local pond for entertainment.
The noble birds were not afraid of people at all - the locals fed them and did not hurt them.
When the villagers heard the shots, ran to the pond, four handsome swans were already lying dead on the water.
Now the staff of the Apostolovsky District Department of the police find out who shot at the birds listed in the Red Book.
"Russian March" is becoming more popular
On November 4, on the Day of National Unity, the "Russian March" agreed with the mayor's office will be held in Moscow.
According to the Levada Center survey, support for the Russian Marches is growing - already 40% of citizens to varying degrees approve of the idea of holding them.
According to the Levada Center, 40% of citizens to varying degrees approve of the conduct of "Russian marches": of these, 11% are definitely positive and 29% - "rather positively."
The popularity of the idea of "Russian Marches" is gradually growing - in 2006, these actions were welcomed by only 14% of Russians, and in December 2010 the holding of such events was already supported by twice as many citizens (28%).
"Definitely negative" to the "Russian Marches" are only 7% of Russians, "rather negative" - 19%.
Another 35% could not formulate their attitude to this action.
This year, the Moscow City Hall agreed to hold a “Russian March” of up to 15,000 people in Lublin, the head of the security department of the capital Alexei Mayorov said today.
This action of nationalists is held every year on the Day of National Unity since 2005.
To the question of sociologists "Have you heard that on November 4 in Russia are held "Russian marches" under the slogans of protecting the rights of Russians in Russia?" three quarters (75%) of citizens answered negatively.
Currently, only one in five Russians (20%) knows about this action.
It is noteworthy that in December 2010, almost a third of citizens (31%) heard about the “Russian Marches”.
Recall that three years ago, on December 11, a spontaneous rally of nationalists took place on Manezhnaya Square, which escalated into mass riots.
"Levada Center" also asked the Russians about what holiday is celebrated on November 4.
In two years, the number of those who know the correct answer (National Unity Day) has increased from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15% of citizens are going to celebrate this holiday.
Approximately the same number (17%) intend to celebrate the October Revolution Day on November 7.
The majority of citizens (62%) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
How the Moscow City Hall agreed on the "Russian March" in Lublin
On October 28, the authorities of the capital agreed to hold the “Russian March” on November 4 in Lublin.
This was reported by the leader of the association "Russians", the organizer of the march Dmitry Demushkin.
In addition to the march in Lublin on the Day of National Unity, there will be a rally and a rock concert of the group "Kolovrat", also coordinated with the authorities.
How was the "Russian March-2012"
On the Day of National Unity in 2012, the nationalists marched from Yakimanskaya Embankment to the Central House of the artist, where the rally took place.
The organizers estimated the number of participants at 20 thousand people, the Ministry of Internal Affairs called the figure of 6 thousand.
Obama campaign considered Biden’s exception in favor of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, the closest advisers of President Barack Obama secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 electoral list.
This discovery is the brightest sensation of all the expected book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 campaign “The stakes are doubled: the game has changed in 2012”.
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported on Thursday evening that the president’s closest aides conducted “large-scale focus group research and opinion polls at the end of 2011” to assess whether Biden’s exclusion could help raise fading hopes for Obama’s re-election.
According to The Times political columnist Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of an attempt by senior campaign officials and the White House, namely former White House chief of staff Bill Daley, to assess the impact of the election on the appointment of former Secretary of State Clinton as vice president.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully guarded at the Chicago campaign headquarters and in the Oval Office.
Only six of the president’s closest advisers — including Daley, former Obama campaign chairman Jim Messina, and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew the replacement was under consideration.
The book Double Bets claims that Daly was the initiator of the attempt to replace Biden, despite their "close personal relationship", but eventually abandoned this step when their data showed that adding Clinton to the electoral list would not "significantly improve Obama's chances".
In an interview with Martin Daly confirmed that the administration was indeed considering the possibility of replacing Biden Clinton.
“I’ve been very vocal about a lot of things, and that was one of them,” Daley told the paper.
You have to remember that the president was in terrible shape at the time, so we thought, ‘Oh my God, what are we going to do?’
Although Daley described the study as a “necessary test,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the campaign had invested heavily in examining whether the move would yield a dividend on the vote.
“Election headquarters don’t spend that kind of money on polls and focus groups unless they’re taking something seriously,” Martin said on the AK 360 program.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was exploring the possibility of a replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then-boss knew of a possible shuffle.
Although Daley said he didn’t think the president “was aware” of a possible replacement, the former administration chief admitted that, “maybe,” Obama knew.
Martin added that Double Bets does not give a clear answer to the question of whether the results of political probing have reached the Obama table.
Cooper asked Martin if he thought Obama was serious about exploring the possibility of removing Biden from the electoral roll.
“Maybe,” said Martin.
Do you want a glow-in-the-dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world’s first glow-in-the-dark jellyfish ice cream.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop glowing food.
He came up with this idea after reading a scientific article about jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue of the person who eats it, raising the pH level in the protein and causing it to glow.
Chris says that because the ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of your mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company Lick Me, I'm Delicious, says: "It's an incredible thing, but it's still very early on in terms of production, so for <0xC2><0xA3>200 you'll get about 2g of the stuff."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
Therefore, when your mouth warms up the protein, it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will start to glow.
We’ve been testing it for the past few months, and it seemed like it would be perfect to present it on Halloween because it creates such a wonderful glowing effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because the luminescence of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So each ball costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But it is quite pleasant in taste.
Charlie’s experimental company, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and the taste of gold leaf.
But his next creation should be even more ambitious.
He said, “I really want to develop an invisible ice cream.”
That’s by definition impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think we’ll find a way to do that.
Ice cream uses fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists
Avangard coach Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about the preparation of his team for the match of the regular championship of the KHL against Salavat, noted that the Omichi conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat of the Magnitogorsk "Metallurg".
The specialist stressed that the Avangard need to pay increased attention to the game in defense.
We watched the video of the match against the Magnitogorsk "Metallurg", - quotes the official website of the "Avant-garde" words Chebaturkin.
- We missed a lot of pucks, not a very nice moment.
Missed due to their mistakes, due to non-fulfillment of the game task.
We knew that the enemy had enemies.
According to statistics, they had five attacks on the go - three goals we scored.
Very good implementation.
Were these mistakes taken into account in the preparation for today's game?
Me and the guys thoroughly understand each match, talk after the game, prepare for a new opponent.
The main thing is that the installation is carried out.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against Metallurg.
The game was played and the score was 2-0.
They missed the goal "in the locker room" - and in the third period they began to make mistakes.
Given how difficult the game was, I did not see the point in connecting the defenders.
You have to defend the whole team.
Now "Avangard" has a long home series, the matches go through the day - the team has accumulated fatigue?
All teams are under the same conditions.
The main thing now is to realize your moments and perform the game task.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you perform the installation - everything is solved not so difficult.
Due to the new rules introduced by the Russian customs, hundreds of trucks have been waiting on the border with Russia for almost a week.
Today, Donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and install bio-toilets
At the border posts at the entrance to Russia have accumulated hundreds of trucks.
This situation arose due to changes in the rules of customs clearance of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm that the queue is created by the Russian side, which did not warn about the innovations in advance.
From October 28, the customs authorities of Russia began to apply additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, - said the Deputy head of the Eastern customs Vladimir Denisov.
The new model document is applicable in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Carriage.
Checkpoints are working in enhanced mode.
The “FACTS” correspondent visited the border and talked with truckers who were hostages of the situation.
Prices in the roadside shop-cafe at the Novoazovsk checkpoint are growing every day, as is the queue from the trucks.
The trucks stand in several rows, stretching for about two kilometers.
Customs terminal Novoazovsk - Veselo-Voznesenka provides one of the most important transport routes from the south of Ukraine on the international highway.
From here, goods are sent to the Stavropol Territory of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
Sunday before midnight was still allowed, and then introduced these rules, - complains trucker Alexei Golovanov (pictured), who carries goods from Turkey to Kazakhstan through Russia and has been spending almost a week in his car.
Under the new rules, to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and payment for cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the cost of the cargo and the distance to which it is transported.
The minimum insurance is 4.5-5 thousand rubles (about 1100-1300 UAH).
Those who go near (say, to Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo worth up to 50 thousand dollars, pay somewhere 15 thousand rubles (3800 hryvnia) and pass.
And the rest are stuck - because no one has so much money with them!
Imagine if a driver carries a cargo worth only four thousand dollars, but all the way to Moscow, he needs 90 thousand rubles (almost 23 thousand hryvnias) to pay for transit!
Conditions for survival at the border - no, - complain truckers who settled down to eat near their cars.
In border shops and cafes and so always expensive, but such prices as here, we have not met anywhere!
The sellers oriented and quickly blew them: 15 hryvnia is a bar, seven hryvnia - a cup of coffee, 25 hryvnia - a plate of soup.
There's only one cafeteria.
And there's no toilet.
We sleep in the steppe, we go to the toilet there.
No washing, no shaving...
I can not get out of the car for a week, my wife prepared everything for me on the way.
A week will pass, - another trucker Viktor Skotarenko consoles himself.
Will my car be ready in a week?
Why do you have a liter and a half of water? - We are interested in the only border store.
There are 11 and 15 hryvnias.
Is the bottle crystal or is the water infused with silver?
We have a cafe, not a shop.
Take it while there is something else, - the saleswoman parries.
After the situation began to be covered in the media, the plight of Ukrainian drivers drew the attention of the authorities of the region.
The leadership of the Amvrosievsk and Novoazovsk regional state administrations have been instructed to provide drinking water to all those waiting in line at the Ukrainian-Russian border, said Sergei Dergunov, acting chairman of the Donetsk regional state administration.
Ambulance teams are currently on duty at checkpoints.
Also, for the convenience of people, bio-toilets will be installed.
According to the official, the problem associated with the queues will be solved in the coming days.
According to the press service of the Donetsk regional state administration, as of October 31, 32 and 68 cars were parked at international checkpoints "Uspenka" and "Novoazovsk", respectively.
"FACTS" will monitor the development of the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow of trying to defame Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking officials of Lithuania and the Eastern Partnership countries - such a statement was made to BNS in the Department of State Security of the Republic (DGB).
This information is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to “discuss” Lithuanian President Dal Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> and publish falsified documents allegedly found in the Russian Gossarhiv, which relate to facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence service, the preparation of the information attack is conducted by the Department for the analysis of public processes of the administration of the President of Russia on interregional and cultural ties with foreign countries.
The structure is headed by Yevgeny Umerenkov, who visited Lithuania several times and took part in the congress of the Lithuanian People’s Party.
Also, the participant of the operation is allegedly an employee of the department V. Smirnov.
According to the special service, Smirnov under the cover of scientific work until the end of 2012 regularly came to Lithuania and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Now Smirnov is banned from entering the country.
On the eve of the President of Lithuania Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> said that he knew about the information on her preparing.
According to her, the main reason is the successful presidency of Lithuania in the Council of the European Union and "the country's desire for energy independence."
The Lithuanian leader has repeatedly criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
Thus, she said that the Kremlin is treated with “insufficient respect” for Lithuania.
In addition, Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> accused the head of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin in putting forward to Lithuania "only demands".
In September, Rospotrebnadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian “milk” to Russia.
It was reported that the quality of products does not comply with sanitary and epidemiological standards.
Then the leader of Lithuania said that if Russia does not lift the ban, the government of the country should prepare an appeal to the WTO.
In the United States, the headmaster of the school shot at teenagers.
The principals of one of the American high schools teenagers literally led to despair.
The man, he said, was forced to take up arms and start shooting.
The incident occurred in Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, juvenile bullies threw toilet paper at the man’s house.
Because of this, the school director opened fire on teenagers, as a result of which a 15-year-old boy received several injuries to his leg and arm.
Since the bullies were not on the property of the director, he was charged with aggravated assault.
The man was released from prison on bail of $125,000.
It should be noted that the shooting of civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible pattern.
Just the day before, a man opened fire in the center of the city of Ridgecrest in the U.S. state of California directly on a passer-by on the street.
After that, the criminal took two random passers-by hostage, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to escape.
Earlier in the elementary school of the city of Newtown, Connecticut, a shooting was opened.
Adam's mother worked at the school, she was an educator.
American school shooting: 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident occurred on January 31 at an American school, this time in Anlanta, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, it was too late not to go to bed and arrange a masquerade for our district.
I'm more of a scumbag now.
I haven’t been asked to hand out candy in my apartment in the last two years, and I probably won’t this year either.
However, statistics show that I am a white crow when it comes to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans — 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and jewelry.
The only thing I look forward to every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that the costumes will cost $1.2 billion out of the $6.9 billion spent.
This year at the peak of fashion sexual inanimate objects.
Women no longer need to be sex workers; they can also be sex food, such as pizza, hamburgers, or carrots.
As for the men, I think we’ll see a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I’m sure Daft Punk-style cosmonauts will hit our Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the costumes most often searched for are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
There is nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we weren’t the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
That means a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don’t mince words.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
That’s about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolates, lollipops, Milk Duds candy, Twizzlers chewing candy, and Clark Bar bars.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is great news for the 41 million candy-demanding children who have prepared to conquer our neighborhoods.
Moreover, we will buy and – let’s not fool ourselves – eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don’t want to eat is sweets in the form of corn kernels; and yet, according to the National Confectionery Association, nearly 35 million pounds of them are sold on Halloween.
That’s about 9 billion individual corn kernels.
This is a mystery that I have yet to solve.
Nothing expresses the essence of Halloween so much as at home with ghosts.
They have amazing names, such as “The Horror Behind the Walls” (which, by the way, is in a real prison), “Howl and Scream” and “House of Shock”.
Moreover, according to the America Haunts Society, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in America, generating about $500 million in revenue, as well as those amazing photos where you almost described yourself, which your friend posted on Facebook and you can’t remove, and then the guy you like sees this photo and leaves a comment like “cool facial expression.”
Finally, let’s talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving out Jack’s lamp is like decorating a Christmas tree, something we’ve been doing since childhood.
Luckily for us, baby fashion in pumpkins only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting out those pumpkins rather than sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
Jack’s lamp, slowly drying out on your porch, probably came from the state of Illinois, which has grown 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want more challenging tasks, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try cutting out some of their 2032-pound pumpkins.
The website of the Ministry of Defense of Estonia was restored after the attack of Ukrainian hackers
The work of the Estonian Ministry of Defence website has been restored after the morning cyber attack, the ministry’s press service reports.
According to Vice-Chancellor of the Ministry of Defense for Information and Administrative Affairs Taimar Peterkop, this was a primitive attack, the site was simply overloaded with a large number of requests.
Our specialists quickly set everything up, to date, the site has been restored.
“The damage done to the ministry is minimal,” Peterkop told Postimees.
According to Peterkop, it is too early to say who organized the attacks.
“We will definitely analyze the causes of the incident and draw our own conclusions from it, but it is completely impossible to prevent such incidents,” he said.
On November 1, the group Anonymous Ukraine posted on the network an appeal in which it confirmed the hacker attack on the website of the Ministry of Defense of Estonia and opposed the partnership of Ukraine and NATO.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We should not be servants of NATO.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member states.
Ukraine does not need a NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine does not need Russia.
Ukraine should not be anyone’s slave.
We stand for an independent Ukraine.
“Hands off Ukraine,” Anonymous said in a statement.
Earlier, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that the company of the marine infantry of the Feodosia separate battalion of the Ukrainian marines will take part in the command and staff exercises of the NATO response forces Steadfast Jazz-2013.
Due to the violence, several schools and a hospital had to be closed.
Four schools in Zimbabwe’s South Matabeleland province have been forced to close due to attacks on students by goblins.
According to the local elder, the children panicked, and it was impossible to continue classes.
The story of the goblins may sound like an invention of a child for a European, but in Africa it is quite a serious argument for closing the school.
Adults are also afraid of unclean power.
In the summer, for example, in Zimbabwe, the hospital was closed due to the fact that the medical staff was also attacked by goblins.

Drew Bowler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally participants turning to Bowler have changed.
Some of them are not experienced racers, but people looking for excitement, adventure and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to offer this route in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that this format offers a new way to try different rally disciplines in the UK and abroad, as well as to prepare participants for the difficult conditions and realities of the rally raid.
“We’ve been very excited to develop the Defender Challenge and it’s going to be a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as the opportunity to take part in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian security forces do not know anything about the group "Brotherly Circle" - Novy Izvestia
About it writes INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
"After reports in the media about the inclusion of Leps in the control lists by the US Treasury Department on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate 'Brotherly Circle', we looked through all the databases, but did not find such a group," the source said.
In his opinion, the dissemination of this information contributes to maintaining the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
Yesterday, the U.S. Treasury Department published on its website a list of alleged members of the criminal group “Brotherly Circle”.
Among them was named the Russian singer Grigory Leps.
He appears on the list as "Sin", posted the day before.
With the data of the popular Russian performer, they coincide.
The exact name is given - Grigory Lepsevridze, creative pseudonym, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, there are five other people mentioned there.
Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another citizen of the former USSR, whose citizenship is not specified.
In the United States, we are sure that Gregory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket, transported money for the bandits on their order.
This message is accompanied by a photo of the singer and all his data that correspond to reality.
Moreover, Leps really recently bought a house in Phuket.
The ministry noted that they intend to impose sanctions against Leps.
The blacklisting of a person by the U.S. Treasury entails the blocking of his assets in the United States and a ban on business contacts with him by persons residing in the United States.
Leps assistant Maya Serikova said that no notifications were received to the singer: "It is difficult to answer the question whether it is Gregory, who is now being talked about in connection with the scandal in the United States."
All Leps knows is the media.
Officially, there were no notifications to him personally, although I do not know whether they are in such cases.
"And, of course, this is all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other - amazing and unexpected," she told RIA Novosti.
According to her, Grigory Leps does not live in Phuket, but, according to the US Treasury, he really has a house on a Thai island.
She said that now Leps is on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news caught him during a flight to the city of Blagoveshchensk.
Escaped on the field in the match "Shinnik"
Became known some details about the identity of the fan who ran on the field during the match of the 1/16 finals of the Cup of Russia between Yaroslavl "Shinnik" and Moscow "Spartak".
As stated by the head of the CDC of the RFU Artur Grigoryants, referring to the data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, this fan is a Muscovite.
He is currently detained.
“In addition, Grigoryants told about how the fan managed to break through on the field: “It turned out that this, let’s call him a spectator, went to the ambulance accompanied by two spectators, referring to heart problems.
He went to the ambulance, which was confirmed by the ambulance doctor.
And then he pushed the two escorts and ran to the field.
He ran from the corner of the East and South Stands to the corner of the East and North Stands.
He ran across the field.
The stewards are responsible for that.
Until the entry into force of the law on sports, this is the area of action of stewards - the police can not interfere in what is on the field.
He ran to the rostrum, climbed over the East rostrum.
And at that time, riots began on the Eastern Stand and on the treadmills," the head of the KDC said.
Recall that by the decision of the KDC, the Moscow Spartak will hold without spectators the upcoming matches of the 15th round of the championship of Russia against Lokomotiv and Zenit, as well as pay a fine of 600 thousand rubles.

Firefighters descended on a rope on a steep slope to save the dog from imminent death
The puppy was lucky to escape after firefighters were called in to pick him up and take him to a safe place after he was somehow stuck at a height of 50 feet on the dangerous slope of a steep slope.
Ruby, a nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel, escaped after being involved in a car accident on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Its owners, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, were at Flappit's career in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They frantically searched for their missing dog and posted messages on social media sites after she fled to a quarry after a small accident.
At about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a starry dog breeder spotted Ruby stuck 50 feet high on the ledge in her career.
A technical rescue team from the Clecchiton fire station hurried to the scene, went down on ropes to rescue Ruby, and used a carry-on to lift her up the hillside.
Rescue officer Andy Clayton said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of a steep slope — 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She did not move a muscle during the rescue, she was completely frozen.
But she's fine now.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is amazing.
Rescue officer Peter Lau said: “Ruby is very lucky to have been rescued.”
There was a possibility that she might have suffered a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for an examination, and it was found that she was fine, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Mrs Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “Watching the rescue was scary.”
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing to have her back in our hands.
The vet said that if she had fainted and lost consciousness, she would likely have fallen.
The firefighters were great.
It was very brave – what they did.
We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr Alderson, from the town of Kitley, added: “We were afraid it might fall, but it stayed there.”
The firefighters were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he didn’t flirt with Katy Perry when she was 18
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star stated that she was the backing vocalist for Jagger's 2004 song Old Habits Die Hard.
Perry said she dined with a veteran rocker and noted, "He flirted with me when I was 18."
She added: “It was a long time ago and he was very good.”
A spokesman for the 70-year-old Jagger said in a statement on Thursday that he “categorically denies that he ever struck out for Katy Perry.”
The representative added: “She may be confusing him with someone else.”
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: Breaking with Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another scarecrow about independence.
This time we are being warned that an independent Scotland will have to join a pan-European free movement zone as a condition of EU membership.
There are a number of stories about passport control in Berwick and the border with barbed wire along the Adrianople Wall.
True, the newspaper Strathclyde pointed to the possible economic benefits of freer movement across the rest of Europe, although – predictably – it did not appear in the headlines.
Nor did anyone point out that EU member states spend a lot of time turning their formal rules around as they see fit.
As Scotland is not now part of the Schengen area, continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels in exchange for what it really wanted from the Scots.
So this is not a noteworthy story.
And so old that it became a fossil: the first time I heard the “duck” that “independence means passport control” was at least 40 years ago.
And yet there is an interesting moment lost in the retelling of an old fairy tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the orders of Europe?
Why change the yoke of London to the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the euro crisis, the Europe project is officially dead.
Across the European Union, parties opposing the EU or calling for the abolition of the euro as the single currency are gaining momentum.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party – founded only this year – emerged out of nowhere and won almost five million votes in the September federal elections, thus essentially ousting the Free Democrats (an analogue of our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has been a watershed moment.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the shackles imposed on national economies through the preservation of the single currency, have led many people to think that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
In fact, the euro system has locked its members in exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – something that German politicians want to preserve.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe finds itself at a pre-disadvantage in terms of production capacity compared to Germany.
The only way to save money is to cut salaries and public spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and currency problems is the deeper problem of Europe’s productive capacity.
As a result of the set of measures on “green” energy introduced by Brussels, a code that means subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers, European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than in the United States.
These are paralyzingly unfavourable price conditions, as we have seen in Grangemouth.
No global wage freeze will stop the crushing victory of cheap U.S. shale gas over Europe’s petrochemical industry.
As a result, a rebellion is brewing, especially in France, once the EU’s most ardent supporter.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policies on Europe, leaving France’s shattered economy in dire straits.
The result is Marine Le Pen’s right-wing, anti-EU National Front party has just won a crucial re-election, dropping the ruling Socialist Party to third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote – a timely warning to British Labour that it is impossible to assume that a split among the right will automatically affect the left.
What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If – and this is very likely – anti-EU parties gain support in these elections, such a bloc will be able to take a dominant position in the European Parliament for the first time.
Here is my opinion: soon the growing sentiment against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will merge to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become something of a vague “Europe of (sovereign) nations” that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and several of its dependent economies can keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I assume that the UK is distancing itself from this project, hoping to get closer to the US.
Nevertheless, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific indicates the likelihood that the UK will remain unattended in the cold of the Atlantic.
Where does that leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (essentially) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed under a freer European arrangement provided we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating Norway ' s experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party government in Scotland is, oddly enough, the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, winning an overwhelming majority of votes in 2011 thanks to objections to spending cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour’s Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, and the ensuing Tory-Liberal Democrat coalition.
It would now be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence just to take austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Aging earlier
African-American and Latino girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers, research shows.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is near
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the triggers of early puberty
The tendency to early puberty is not so pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be afraid if her daughter begins to form the germs of the breast and grow pubic hair at 7 or 8 years old?
At the American Academy of Pediatrics’ annual conference this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplovitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time calming my parents down — usually that doesn’t mean a rapid onset of full sexual maturity,” Kaplovitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair, and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there has only been a slight shift in menarche age (first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.
“Once the breasts start to develop, it’s at least two to three years before menarche,” said Kaplovitz, who is also the author of “Early Sexual Maturity in Girls: How to Cope with This Common Problem.”
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will progress.
There is a debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered "premature" when breast enlargement is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop – something the pediatrician can monitor closely.
Faster progression can serve as a basis for endocrinologist tests to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature bone aging, which can eventually lead to stunted growth and low growth in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the child's age, level of development, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about medication, but admits that “repression of puberty can alleviate girls’ behavioral problems and feelings that they are different from their peers.”
Another big problem is clear: parents just don’t want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They’re worried about the risk of pregnancy or even how they’ll handle hygiene issues,” Kaplovitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman, whose daughter began menstruating at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we were talking about menstruation, she wasn’t emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first among her friends.
There are many theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
In boys, as in girls, puberty comes earlier.
Kaplovitz argues that the premise that has the greatest weight is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped to conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years old, which links the amount of fat in the body with puberty.
Other evidence supports this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Latino girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
There are various explanations.
Around the world, early puberty appears to be affected by everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery: although boys have facial and pubic hair at a younger age, the tendency to full early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of pimples and pubic hair occurs even in infants and children of nursery age.
“We need to be careful about how we determine the true onset of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Gorieb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be ashamed to receive instructions from the pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This could mean an earlier than expected conversation,” Kaplovitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who bloom early need confirmation that even when it happens earlier than expected, this process is a normal part of life.
American Boeing, stranded in Chita, is preparing to take off
The American aircraft that conducted observation flights over the territory of Russia under the Open Skies Treaty and made an unscheduled landing in Chita on Wednesday, November 1, at 8:30 Moscow time, will leave the air port of the city.
The airport management allowed the departure of the board, having received money for fuel.
As reported at the airport, the plane will take off in Ulan-Ude.
According to other reports, he will go to the United States.
As reported, the plane flying to Ulan-Ude landed in the Trans-Baikal Territory due to fog.
Due to unpaid bills, he was not released from Chita airport.
There are 30 people on board the plane, including the crew, they spent two nights at the airport, ITAR-TASS reports.
According to the terms of the Open Skies Treaty, people on board the aircraft are not allowed to go outside the Chita airport, they can pass border control only at two airports in Russia - in Kubinka and in Ulan-Ude.
The Treaty on Open Skies was signed in 1992 and 34 States are parties to it.
Observation flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, and European countries.
The main objectives of the Treaty are the development of transparency, the promotion of monitoring of the implementation of agreements in the field of arms control, the expansion of capabilities to prevent crises and resolve crisis situations within the framework of the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do late celebrities earn - MK in the United States MK
The ranking of living celebrities with the highest income in 2013 was headed by Madonna, who earned $ 125 million.
But she was “swapped” by the late Michael Jackson, whose posthumous income from October 2012 to October 2013 amounted to 160 million.
Significantly behind him are other deceased celebrities who last year "earned" several times less.
The second in the list of the most "wealthy" departed celebrities, compiled by Forbes magazine at the end of the year was Elvis Presley - 55 million for the year, and the author of Peanuts comics Charles Schulz with 37 million.
In addition to them, the top five included Elizabeth Taylor, who was the leader last year (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million).
The list also includes Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein.

Jet aircraft manufacturers feud over seat width when big orders are at stake
A fierce dispute has erupted between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist-grade seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a fierce confrontation at the Dubai Aviation Expo this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of seats provided on long-haul flights to economy class passengers whose interests are not always in the spotlight of airlines, while the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in the claims about the effectiveness of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of an industry standard that would provide for a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy class cabins, but its main U.S. rival Boeing says it should be decided by airlines.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in sales of increasingly larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, and potentially record orders are expected at the November 17-21 event.
The layout of the rear of the aircraft – especially whether 9 or 10 people are sitting in a row – is central to the cost-effectiveness statements of the new mini-bus projects.
Boeing claims its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on economy-class seats more than 17 inches wide, accommodated 10 in each row.
Airbus says a competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch seats, each 9 in a row.
Aircraft giants often exchange blows on technical issues with the help of advertising in the professional press.
And now Airbus is addressing the public directly ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to become the leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what could be the start of a new advertising war by showing financiers a slide depicting three people in a restaurant pressed against each other, titled “Would You Agree to This?”
“Boeing offers long-haul flights on seats narrower than those of regional turboprop aircraft,” said John Leahy, Airbus sales manager.
With a change in diet, people gain weight, but the aircraft seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 set the standard for modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American male between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
The waist circumference of the average 21st-century American man is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health service statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the 1950s seat concept, when the average waist circumference of those recently dubbed the “reactive public” was already.
Airbus says it has commissioned a study showing that an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes Airbus’ figures on seat sizes and says manufacturers shouldn’t meddle in decisions about how airlines strike a balance between fares and amenities.
According to her, studies show that the comfort of the cabin depends not only on the width of the seat.
“It really comes down to giving airlines the choice and opportunity to do what they think they need to do to succeed,” said Boeing salon specialist Kent Craver.
They do not want us to decide for them what will bring them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the question is to increase the space on the sides, but for suppliers it is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
The dispute is being fought over aircraft orders valued at at least $700 billion at catalog prices in the coming decades — enough to change the balance of U.S. and European exports.
As first reported by Reuters in July, the location of the seats is exactly what fuels the rivalry in the battle between the newest jet aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing are reporting a 20 percent increase in profitability per seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing’s stated specifications are based in part on a comparison of the 777X’s 10-seater series with the original 777’s 9-seater series design.
The gain in unit cost is reduced when compared to the 10-seater layout currently in use.
“The reason Boeing is doing this is to squeeze in more seats and make their aircraft more competitive compared to our developments,” said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Airbus in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that salons with full 10-seater rows for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a dense seating arrangement that can go hand-in-hand with lower fares.
“An eighteen-inch wide seat would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, Airbus’ offer is driven by the threat posed by the 777,” said interior specialist Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer a catalog of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
World-traveling jet aircraft vendors even carry roulettes with them to check out competing layouts.
Inflating comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very tight cabin layout for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10-seater rows, but says it hasn’t sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for additional cabin modifications, offering wider aisle seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, according to experts, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to “take off”, but can distract attention from the wave of sales of the 777X model.
A new anti-nicotine vaccine may deprive the process of smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could deprive the process of smoking cigarettes of pleasure.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before human trials begin, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Wall Cornell College of Medicine in New York said the first results were encouraging.
“We very much hope that this vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit by trying all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine addiction is strong enough to overcome it with these modern means,” said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information to produce anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
Antibodies track down any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing a smoker from getting a nicotine kick.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice, who were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And mice who were not given the vaccine were “relaxed,” a sign that nicotine was reaching their brains, the researchers said.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain a high level of antibodies, injections had to be done so often that they proved expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if a future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to children before they have the desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t get that pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them get rid of that habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but cautioned that more research was needed.
Oleinikov: a third of rural settlements near Moscow fully subsidized
Deputy Governor of the Moscow region Yuri Oleynikov said that almost a third of rural settlements of the Moscow region are fully subsidized
In total, 187 out of 288 settlements receive subsidies from the region’s budget.
In 2013, 187 out of 288 settlements received subsidies from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the budget revenues of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50%, and 83 - one hundred percent subsidized.
As part of the budget provision, about 25 billion rubles are sent from the regional budget," Oleinikov said.
Also, the Vice-Governor noted that only three urban settlements - Mytishchi, Odintsovo and Pushkino - the volume of budget revenues is more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million rubles, "this is completely lacking."
The cost of maintaining the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements of the Moscow region is over 70%, "there is a decrease in the quality of services," said Oleinikov.
Earlier, he instructed the heads of the municipalities of the Moscow region until the end of November to think about which settlements need to be enlarged, amalgamated into urban districts or change the system of administrative management.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Earlier, the governor of the Moscow region said that as part of the administrative reform in the Moscow region, it is planned to reduce the number of subsidized rural settlements.
Also in Mozhaisk, Kashir, Solnechnogorsk, Kolomensky districts, Lyubertsy and Kotelniki there is a request for the enlargement of municipalities.
Discussions on this issue in the cities and areas of the region will begin in November.
The Chairman of the Mosobldum Igor Bryntsalov also said that about 30 rural settlements in 12 districts of the Moscow region are planned to unite in the framework of the upcoming administrative reform.
This is due to the fact that out of 178 rural settlements in the Moscow region, less than a third have an "acceptable" financial base, and 100 - subsidized.
Diana Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not hide how much pleasure she gets from raising her children.
Despite the fact that right now Arbenina especially devotes a lot of time to creativity and social activities, she still finds the opportunity to mess with Marta and Artem, and not only spends time on their training, but also entertains as much as she can.
Over the past week, Diana has twice reported to her fans about her teaching talents.
She first posted a photo on Facebook showing how she teaches children to read.
And yesterday, she was out partying with fans, showing how she dressed Artem and Martha for Halloween.
For the broom races are ready! our first Halloween" - so Diana called a photo of her children dressed in festive costumes.
Which is not wise, because they, like no other Russian boys and girls, are related to this holiday, since they were born in America.
Germany is the first in Europe to introduce an “undefined gender” in the registration of children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to allow hermaphrodite-born children to be listed as “undetermined” instead of male or female.
The parents of the child will have the right to temporarily leave the column "sex" in the birth certificate unfilled.
Instead of "F" (female) or "M" (male), parents can temporarily write "X" (indefinite).
This decision is aimed at not pushing parents to rush with the operation to "clarify" the sex.
According to statistics, one in 2,000 newborns in the world is born with a hermaphrodite.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the state’s anti-corruption watchdog.
Former New South Wales Secretary of State Joe Tripodi has denied making changes to the lease of seaside properties at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who secretly owned stakes in three state-owned properties.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Commission (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid lobbied several state ministers to extend leases on Serkular Key, where the Obeid family owns two restaurants and a cafe, without going through a tender after they expired in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid’s secret involvement in real estate, following testimony given by Mr. Tripodi’s former deputy chief of staff, Lynn Ashpool, on Thursday.
During several years of discussions that began in 2005, the government insisted that the lease be put up for open tender.
Tenants were against this, and also wanted longer lease terms.
In 2009, the leases on the Cercular Key businesses, which brought the Obeid family about $2.5 million a year, were extended without being put up for an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially campaigned for open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who admitted that Mr. Tripodi had urged changes to the government's lease policy.
In the ICAC transcript of telephone conversations, conversations were made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dann, a senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under Mr. Obeid in the fisheries department.
“Was the issue discussed in these telephone conversations a question of developing a commercial lease policy?” asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Willie to Mr Tripodi.
“No,” replied Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't that.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
According to a senior official, Israeli warplanes are attacking targets inside Syria
A senior administration official confirmed in an interview with Fox News that Israeli warplanes struck a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was a Russian-made SA-125 missile.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out air strikes on shipments of missiles inside Syria.
Foreign workers on visas of subclass 457 can be tested for "authenticity"
The “authenticity” test for foreign workers on Class 457 visas is under review by the government as it outlines an expansion of repressive measures.
This test, if accepted, will be applied on the basis of criteria aimed at preventing the use of Class 457 visas to fill unskilled positions or as a loophole to move family and friends to Australia.
The document submitted by the government for discussion was published today, while former Labour MP Maxine McKew criticised the government’s rhetoric regarding foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia’s neighbours.
“The loud statements like ‘foreigners at the end of the queue’ and ‘working for Australians first’ represent a very unpleasant setback to the times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australia-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was white labor that needed to be protected — and if some in the region saw echoes of this historic artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The paper outlines 12 measures previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O’Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday to meet with officials about human smuggling, has already made five of the recommended changes, with the rest under consideration.
If the “authenticity” criteria are adopted, the visa applicant can be examined for “whether the application is genuine in the circumstances where the applicant is a relative or close acquaintance of the owner or a person related to the financing of the enterprise.”
Enterprises may also be required to report on the number of holders of visas of subclass 457, since previously enterprises that intended to sponsor a small number of employees then employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The man’s grief-stricken nine-year-old son accompanied him on his way to Australia, and since his father’s death on Wednesday, he has been supported by a cousin who was also on board the ship.
Australian authorities rushed the man to the hospital of the island of Christmas, where he died.
Friend of Semena Varlamova said that the hockey player suffers from alcoholism
A friend of the hockey player Semen Varlamov Evgenia Vavrinyuk said that he suffers from alcoholism, reports the Russian News Service.
“He has no idea how to stop drinking,” the woman said.
Recall that Vavrinyuk filed a lawsuit for beating the goalkeeper of the Russian national team Semyon Varlamov, who is also a member of the club "Colorado".
According to her, the hockey player dragged her by the hair, and also beat - after the attack, her hands, chest, stomach and neck were damaged.
Varlamov himself confessed to the Denver police and confessed to the beating, describing in detail what happened.
He was arrested, but later released on $5,000 bail.
The court did not limit the athlete in the movement around the country, but forbade to approach Vavrinyuk.
He also faces up to six years in prison for domestic violence.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact for Scotland of the HS2 railway project.
The HS2 project involves the opening of high-speed communication with Scotland and the north of England, with the start of the First Phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would “unite the UK”.
Scotland’s Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was “enthusiastic” about the prospect of working with the UK government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase Two is completed, lines will be laid to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and the north of England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in railway capacity and reducing travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the opportunity to make the journey from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal under HS2 is to create a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it’s also about connecting cities to each other; across the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will get a better connection thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "unanimously" support Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “High-speed rail has every chance of bringing huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds the economic weight of Scotland to the overall argument for high-speed rail across the UK.”
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the UK Government to consider options for building a high-speed railway in Scotland, creating benefits for all and continuing the Glasgow-Edinburgh railway line already planned by the Scottish Government.
I look forward to reviewing the results of the study with British ministers next year and jointly deciding on the next steps.
Thorium - the new hope of nuclear energy?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to meet their energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they exist) has a negative impact on the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
Nuclear energy does without both, but leaves behind a lot of expensive in the disposal of waste.
Recently, scientists have paid attention to thorium - another radioactive element of the Mendeleev system.
It is found all over the world, and, according to experts, its splitting does not leave waste that must be stored for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia will remain in force for the time being
Passengers of Australian airlines will need to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing, despite measures in the United States to soften the rules regarding these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during takeoff and landing, provided they remain in “Flight Mode.”
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are annoyed that they do not have access to their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which required American airlines to carry out a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also noted that they are considering this statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight are still in place in Australia.
“The Civil Aviation Safety Authority currently does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,” it said.
This issue is governed by regulations that require air carriers to maintain safety at all times, and passengers to comply with the safety rules notified to them by crew members.
Virgin, which has already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the expanded use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on board, was not against the changes, but said it would follow the regulator’s instructions.
“We would welcome consideration by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority of allowing the use of electronic devices because we really think it will improve the quality of customer service now that it (the on-board wireless entertainment system) is on our aircraft,” the spokesman said.
Qantas said it would abide by the current rules.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not plan to change it anytime soon,” she said.
The FAA ruling applies to U.S. airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly carefully study the FAA’s decision and the reasons that caused it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the order will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to radio interference from mobile devices, as well as revise manuals, training materials, rules for the carriage of hand luggage and instructions for passengers.
“Once the airline has verified and confirmed the noise resistance of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-books and smartphones at any altitude,” the FAA said.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during boarding.
In addition, according to the group’s recommendation, heavier devices should be placed under the seats or in the upper luggage compartments during take-off and landing.
The head of Dagestan can be heard in the Kuban anthem notes of extremism
The football match between Anzhi and Kuban resulted in a political conflict between the authorities of the Krasnodar Territory and Dagestan after the fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the Kuban anthem sounded differently.
The head of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatipov on Thursday suggested that republican parliamentarians go to court, because the anthem of the Krasnodar Territory allegedly gives calls for interethnic discord, in particular, calls for war with the “basurmans”.
Take the anthem of the Krasnodar Territory, it is in our time in 1995 approved this anthem.
It’s a shame and no one is doing it.
"Remembering you here as a native mother, as an enemy, as a Basurman, we are going to the battle of death" - for which such words should be written in the anthem, to poison some believers on other believers," Parliament Speaker Hizri Shihsaidov expressed solidarity with Abdulatipov.
Putin has achieved impunity for his friend Assad
And now news from overseas, namely from Syria, where, as we know today, Israel struck Russian-made missiles, which were reportedly intended for Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition - to destroy its chemical weapons production by November 1.
This was done as part of an agreement brokered by Russia that allowed the U.S. not to conduct the military operation it came close to this summer.
Our main international correspondent, Richard Engel, will tell us more about the weapons and what they mean for the Syrian president.
Washington has said that the Assad regime will be punished for this.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August from the poison gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombing, but in the form of a deal made by Assad’s friend Vladimir Putin.
Syria will give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
Today is an important milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria had decommissioned the declared chemical weapons factories.
The longer-term and more difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and their components.
As we understand it, it is about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say that Assad’s days were numbered.
I think Assad should go.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will happen.
He's no longer legitimate and has to go.
But Assad remains.
And he feels even more confident.
Its troops continue to use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His opponents are divided and poorly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many are starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar al-Assad escaped punishment for mass murder.
The agreement on chemical weapons is called the success of diplomacy, inspectors were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself gave the impression of a person ready to cooperate.
Today in Washington, the US Ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child starves to death, his mother is hardly relieved that he was not killed by chemical weapons.
Assad is holding on.
He changes weapons to power.
The President of the Russian Federation created a separate Ministry of construction and housing and communal services
Russian President Vladimir Putin has created a new ministry, which oversees construction and housing and utilities issues, and offered to head it to the ex-governor of the Ivanovo region, Mikhail Menu, during a personal meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Men in the residence in Novo-Ogarevo, and Men did not refuse to head the new department.
Press Secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov explained that all functions related to construction and housing and communal services are transferred to the new ministry from the Ministry of Regional Development.
Mikhail Men - the son of the famous Orthodox priest Archpriest Alexander Men, graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petrochemistry named after Gubkin.
Since 1995, his political career began - he was elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergiyevo-Posadsky district, was a deputy of the State Duma, the first deputy prime minister of the Moscow region government, and the deputy prime minister of the Moscow government.
From 2005 to October 16, 2013, Mikhail Men was governor of the Ivanovo region.
Pawnshop owners in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is struggling
In a pawnshop in Singapore’s Bendemir shopping mall, Janani Amirthalinga pawns a gold bracelet, a ring and earrings to pay for her daughter’s schooling.
“My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is invested there,” says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family’s monthly income isn’t enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of Southeast Asia — where household debt is rising — is such that ValueMax, where it conducts its deal, this week became the third pawnshop to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
A mortgage on jewelry is not just a quick way to get money (S$1,300 in Ms. Amirthaling’s case), but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Pawnshops in Singapore typically charge an effective annual interest rate of 17% — just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank branch, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require a credit check or proof of salary and can issue loans faster than banks.
Therefore, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel pressured by rising cost of living and the rapid rise in household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of steady growth following the global financial crisis and cheap credit fueled by free monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to compensate for declining incomes as their economies slow.
This week, Standard & Poor’s, a rating agency, pointed to an increase in the family’s leverage, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia topped the list with 80% of GDP compared to 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week barely came out of a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continued declines in exports and weakening consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that as prices rise, people in the middle and bottom of the [income scale] will look for ways to top up their income where they can,” says Song Seng-wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The record high gold prices over the past two years have intensified the haste with which people pawn their personal belongings as they take advantage of the opportunity to get paid for their family jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the things laid in the 200 pawnshops of the city-state are gold products.
People say, “The price of gold looks good, let’s put on Grandma’s gold chain and get it back next month.”
In Thailand, the largest pawnshop operator EasyMoney has seen an increase in the number of customers using its branches in recent months, up to 20%.
The growth in the pawnshop business is such that ValueMax, the operator of the Bendemire branch and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia too, says Yeah Li Ching, CEO of ValueMax.
The company will fund the expansion, using 60 percent of the S$66 million raised this week as a result of the stock offering on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some lenders have caused fire criticism due to high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says that the pawnshop not only offers cheaper tariffs than other lenders, it also does not increase the debt directly.
“Clients mortgage items they already own, and monetizing personal assets doesn’t increase household debt,” she says.
The institution is gaining increasing public recognition as a means to obtain short-term, secured funding.
And at the same time, pawnshops are used not only by those categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax branches, pawning gold bars or Rolex watches, which can give up to 60 percent of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
“These include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for short-term commercial projects or investments, or small businesses who need to overcome temporary monetary difficulties,” says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money very quickly.
Today, it is not the number of available medical institutions and their status that is important for the population, but the quality of medical care provided.
The implementation of the program "Modernization of health care in the Tula region for 2011 - 2013", the reorganization of medical institutions of our city will create an optimal structure for providing medical care to the population, including gynecological patients, pregnant women and mothers.
So, after combining with the hospital, there was an even greater opportunity to attract narrow specialists from the NGKB State Institution for consultations of pregnant women with various pathologies, to conduct additional examinations on the basis of the hospital.
During the implementation of the modernization program, the material and technical base of the maternity hospital was significantly improved, modern equipment corresponding to world standards appeared.
During these years, about 8 million rubles were allocated for major repairs of premises, 112 pieces of equipment were purchased in the amount of 42 million rubles.
The most modern equipment is equipped with an intensive post for newborns.
In the operating room, during a cesarean section, the Sell-Saver apparatus is used, which allows you to collect blood from the operating wound and after special treatment return it to the woman in labor, avoiding transfusion of foreign blood.
Modern equipment is also equipped with a department of clinical and laboratory diagnostics.
In the women's consultation there is an electronic registration, in the near future it is planned to introduce electronic maps and patient histories.
Thanks to the development of telemedicine, it became possible to consult gynecological patients, pregnant women, midwives and newborns with regional specialists.
Chechens beat and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechens arrested by French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been ongoing since March of this year.
About 60 women complained about the actions of the Caucasians.
The bandits reportedly ordered prostitutes to one of the Strasbourg hotels and then beat and robbed them.
The leader of the gang was a 27-year-old previously convicted native of Chechnya.
Bayern defender David Alaba became the best athlete of Austria in 2013, according to the official website of the Bundesliga.
In this dispute, he was ahead of representatives of winter sports, which traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was taken by skier Marcel Hirscher, and the third - ski jumper from the ski jump Gregor Schlierenzauer.
Last season, a 21-year-old Austrian of Filipino-Nigerian descent helped his team win the Champions League, the championship and the German Cup, as well as the UEFA Super Cup.
Ex-wife of Arshavin rests with actor Andrey Chadov
The former civil wife of the football player of St. Petersburg "Zenith" Andrei Arshavin Yulia Baranovskaya spends a vacation together with the actor Andrei Chadov.
Yulia rests in Italy in the company of actress Anastasia Zadorozhnaya, her fiancé - skater Sergei Slavnov, and actor Andrei Chadov.
Photos from the joint walks of couples are published in Instagram by Anastasia Zadorozhnaya.
This is not the first joint photo of Andrei and Julia.
October 5, Zadorozhnaya published a picture in which the couple is hugging on the shore of the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, Zenit midfielder Andrei Arshavin admitted that he lives separately from his civilian wife Yulia.
Yulia Baranovskaya and Andrei Arshavin have been together since 2003, they have three children.
Recently it became known that Arshavin is dating an ex-model Alice Kazmina.
Arshavin’s new girlfriend was married to a top manager of the corporation.
$325 million rescue package for Tasmanian health
The federal government insists the $325 million rescue package for Tasmania’s weakened health care system will be complemented by tough conditions that ensure the state government doesn’t waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking “urgent measures” to avert a crisis caused by the island state’s aging population, higher rates of chronic disease, and system restrictions.
The decision on funding for four years was made after consultations between the government and independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed an emergency rescue package that we believe will address the specific challenges facing the state,” Ms. Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for a planned blitz campaign.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopedic and cataract surgery, will help overcome the backlog.
There is also money for non-prescription clinics in Hobart and Lonceston to improve after-hospital care, train health professionals, mental health services, and implement personal electronic health card systems in local hospitals.
“These investments will go to the best doctors’ ideas on how to better help Tasmania’s health care system,” Ms. Plibersek said.
The Minister insisted that the Tasmanian Government would operate under strict accountability and responsibility.
The state will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth funds and report monthly on where it spends those additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
Wilkie said today that $325 million will not solve anything “unless it is followed by genuine reform that puts Tasmania’s health care system on a more sustainable footing.”
Nevertheless, he commended the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he had first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will contribute significantly to bringing this state’s health care system out of critical condition,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional sampling procedures largely compensate for recent reductions.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s statement is “a solution similar to a leukoplasty.”
“The reason we’re here is because the state’s Labour government ripped $430 million out of the health care system,” he told ABC TV.
When the state government rips off nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million, you can’t pretend that’s good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plibersek to ensure that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The film adaptation by Guillaume Niccolo of the novel by Denis Diderot boasts exceptional staging and historical details, but it is also harder to perceive than it should have been.
The film, set in 1760s France, tells the dark story of Susannah, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she begins to rebel, she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of a sadistic abbot and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never goes down to vulgarity or sensation – and that’s the problem.
Because of its solemnity, the narration risks becoming a test like a hairdo for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production facilities, the monitoring group says
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, an international monitoring group said on Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the north of the country near one of the sites where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
Also Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people have been killed since the country’s civil war began nearly three years ago.
The statement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before the
A November 1 deadline set by this Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or “make inoperable” all chemical weapons production facilities and mechanisms that allow chemicals to be mixed with toxic gas and filled with ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all of Damascus’ chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
This statement was made during the fierce fighting on Thursday in the city of Safira, which, according to experts, is a facility for the production of chemical weapons, as well as the place of its storage, according to the British-based Syrian Center for the Protection of Human Rights.
A group of activists who tracked the losses through a network of activists in Syria said on Thursday that 120,296 people had been killed.
Of that number, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, the group said, 29,954 people are members of President Bashar al-Assad's armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government militants and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah fighters.
Also among the dead, the statement said, were 2,202 army defectors and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
According to the United Nations, an estimated 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
This figure has not been updated since.
The conflict has forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad’s forces have been fighting rebels in Safir for several weeks, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda groups.
The centre said there were casualties on both sides on Thursday but did not provide specific figures.
The fighting highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, driven by the tight deadlines of their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal, in the midst of an ongoing civil war.
In a statement, the OPCW, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, said its team was “now satisfied that it has verified and seen destroyed all critical production facilities and equipment for mixing/refueling declared by Syria.”
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned.”
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites claimed by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the two sites for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said both sites were, according to Syria’s statement, “abandoned and ... chemical weapons program items contained in them have been moved to other declared sites that have been inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the Safir site was one of two sites that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which is due to be approved next month by the OPCW’s executive committee.
“I welcome the courage and bravery that you have all shown in carrying out the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said the group’s director general, Ahmet Uzumju, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
For the third year in a row, the civil war has pitted rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, against the Assad government and its security forces, which are made up of members of its Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam.
As for other events, the head of the center, Rami Abdurrahman, said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air defense facility in the coastal province of Syria, Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over the sentence of the organizers of the terrorist attack in Bali
Survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in a bomb blast in Bali in 2002 reacted angrily to the verdict handed down to the last of the conspirators, who stood trial, and said Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia’s most wanted men, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in building the explosive devices used in the attack.
He can be released within 15 years if he receives parole.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, in which 202 people, including 88 Australians, were killed and dozens more injured.
He was also found guilty on a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of church bombings across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have demanded a life sentence, although they could insist that a man dubbed a “bomber” for his reputation as a master of explosives should be sentenced to death.
The decision deepened the painful memories of Perth mother June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in a terrorist attack carried out by Patek and his accomplices nearly a decade ago.
Barely holding back tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
“I really think he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He must appear before the firing squad,” said Ms. Cortin AAP.
“I have to live every day knowing that I won’t have grandchildren anymore and I won’t see my daughters.”
The Sari Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was detonated in a parked van just after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack filled with explosives, just 20 seconds earlier.
After this attack, he fell into a coma for a month and “died” three times, being connected to the life support system.
Mr Hughes said Patek should share the fate of three other members of the Jama’a Islamiya terrorist cell responsible for the massacre, Amrozi, Muhlas and Imam Sumudra, who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty more than anyone.
To save his life, well, there's no reason to save his life.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds is not that much.
Patek is the last person to stand trial in Bali.
He had been in hiding for nearly a decade, but was eventually detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. troops killed former al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent revealed that the intelligence data testified that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to restore ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t give up,” said Mrs. Cortin.
Until recently, he had no regrets about how much grief he had caused to other people.
The verdict comes on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” says Ms. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal his conviction.
FAU: “Air passengers can now use gadgets on airplanes (but not call from a mobile phone)”
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not talk on mobile phones, according to the long-awaited new guidelines published Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect the changes to happen immediately.
How quickly such a change is implemented will vary depending on the airline, FAU administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to show the FAA how their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they are updating their flight crew training manuals and device stacking rules to comply with the new guidelines.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
“Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve an expansion in the use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAU said.
Passengers are now required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the plane door closes.
They should not restart them until the plane reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the captain gives a "good".
Passengers should turn off their devices again when the plane is descending for landing, and not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are adequately protected against electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.
“Once the new policy is safely implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this) it will be a win-win,” Glading said.
We are frankly tired of feeling “on duty at school” when it comes to this issue.
But internet connections for surfing, exchanging emails, texting or downloading data will still be banned at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.
Thus, there are still no "Words with friends" - an intelligent Internet game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when a sensational case occurred: the actor was removed from an American Airlines plane for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was at the gate for landing.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still need to be stowed in the luggage compartment, as they can injure someone if they fly around the cabin.
Calls from mobile phones in flight will also continue to be prohibited.
Regulatory powers over telephone calls belong to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert at CBS News, said cell phones were still considered a risk.
“Cell phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference for navigation devices, but we know through the FCC that they can create interference for cell towers when the plane is in the air,” Rosenker said.
The industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to look into the matter recommended last month that the government allow for greater use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, there has been increasing pressure on the FAA to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill, argue that there are no compelling security reasons for the bans.
Compliance with the restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce, as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to reports of interference to navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began carrying FM radios, high-tech gadgets of the time.
New airliners are much more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also being developed and approved by the FAA as being resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi at cruising altitude for several years.
Aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airliners are geared for wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices typically emit radio signals of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, emit only minimal signals when browsing pages.
But signals become more powerful when devices load or send data.
Among those who sought to ease restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company downloaded an entire airliner with their Kindle e-book readers and flew on it to check for problems, but never found them.
Members of the FAU Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of the devices posed any risk.
Douglas Kidd, of the National Air Passenger Association, said he believes the interference from the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members have said there are only individual pilots’ reports confirming that the devices can interfere with aviation systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to require passengers to turn off devices during instrument landings in conditions of limited visibility.
A group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a sensible step towards the passengers, who are now using many technological devices.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and security,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Driving schools will be able to conduct exams for obtaining a driver's license
Private companies with their own computerized racetrack will be able to take the driving license exams.
About it writes "Kommersant" with reference to the draft government resolution "On admission to driving".
According to the newspaper, there are currently only about 30 such autodromes in Russia.
It is assumed that students of such "privileged" driving schools will count the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the State Traffic Inspectorate will monitor the passing of exams every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30% of the exams in theory and more than 20% of the site students do not pass the first time, such a school will be deprived of privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for autodromes contained in the draft government decree come into force on November 5, 2014.
The project also contains requirements for training in driving two-wheeled vehicles.
From January 1, 2015, motorcycle owners will have to pass an exam in urban traffic to obtain category A rights.
In addition, from May 5, 2014, companies will not be able to hire drivers of foreigners with foreign rights.
Such workers will have to obtain Russian rights after passing the exam.
A bird airlifted to safety from a North Sea drilling rig is released back into the wild
A bird airlifted to shore after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the North Sea has been released back into the wild.
The water cowherd was placed in a helicopter bound for Aberdeen last month and then released by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals’ (SPCA) Scottish branch at a rescue centre in Alloa.
Center Manager Colin Seddon said: “This water cowherd is most likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe who has fallen into a zone of strong winds over the North Sea.”
It seems that the bird has become exhausted and was able to find shelter on the oil tower.
He added: “She was unable to take off again, so we were asked for help.”
The water shepherd was healthy and in good condition by the time he was released.
Is the elite of Europe ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to bring together business representatives and identify what changes Britain’s wealth and jobs creators want to see in its relationship with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts on the UK, business and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a wide range of businesses in the UK by size, sector and region.
The findings of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are currently looking for export opportunities outside Europe, with a particular focus on countries that are modernizing and growing while EU countries are stagnant.
They want the government to prioritize new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than wasting time on the long and difficult process of reforming the EU’s tangled institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy issues, from antitrust regulation to product laws, most business leaders felt that control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, with business representatives saying that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits of being in the European trade zone, even 40 percent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European of all companies, agreed with this.
Last but not least, our survey of business leaders revealed that a clear majority wants the UK to pursue a treaty change and a relationship with the EU based on trade rather than politics.
This result, which has been observed among businesses of all sizes and the largest business groups, shows that businesses are pushing for a “significant change” that will bring powers back to the UK.
The stakes are high – achieving treaty changes and more favourable terms for the UK would provide a 16 per cent shift in the vote to remain in the EU.
The prime minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that British business supports his plan to revise the terms of Britain’s EU membership.
It also shows that businesses expect the revision to lead to a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.
Better conditions for British business are possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on the path of closer economic and financial integration.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in the UK and, as our survey results show, for business this means an increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels’ regulatory activities.
U.S. Secret Service taps Pope's personal phone
The activities of the Vatican are under the watchful control of the American intelligence services.
New documents from Edward Snowden’s collection show that U.S. intelligence was listening to all the talks of the previous Pope Benedict, and now closely cares for Pope Francis.
His phone began to be tapped even before he became the head of the Vatican.
The process of electing a new pope was also monitored.
What was given special importance in the United States?
The secret service connected to the cell phones of the cardinals who gathered in Rome to choose the next pope.
The phones of the residence where the conclave members lived were also tapped.
American spies listened to all the main contenders for the papal throne in order to prevent the appearance of an undesirable figure for Washington.
The magazine Panorama writes that the “big ear of the United States” continued to intercept the prelates’ conversations until the conclave ended on March 12.
It is alleged that the Argentine Archbishop Bergoglio has been singled out in the United States since 2005 as the future Pope.
U.S. intelligence also tracked the negotiations related to the election of the new president of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine writes that a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives continues to work at the U.S. Embassy in Rome, extracting information about policies and financial flows.
In turn, the Vatican conciliatoryly announced that it does not care about the American "wiretapping", even if it happens.
From the leadership of the United States of America, the Holy Fathers have no secrets.
Snowboarder for the Olympic bill was specially photographed
The Bank of Russia on Wednesday issued a commemorative banknote dedicated to the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
The denomination of the bill is 100 rubles.
But in the network, bloggers are already actively ironic about the commemorative banknote.
After the presentation of the Olympic bill on October 30, they drew attention to the fact that the image of a snowboarder from the banknote can be found in photo banks.
In particular - in the free photo storage StockExchange, where this photo is dated 2005.
The same photo is used in a Photoshop tutorial published on the Russian website Megaobzor on January 18, 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in advertising smartphones RugGear.
The Olympic banknote is made in blue and blue.
On one side is a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other - a view of the Olympic stadium and the Firebird.
The author of the design of the banknote is Pavel Bushuyev, who won the competition among students of the Repin St. Petersburg Academy of Arts.
At the presentation, it was noted that several sports were considered - skiing, freestyle and jumping from a springboard, but in the end they chose snowboarding, since it is a relatively young sport.
According to a source close to the Central Bank, the regulator is not indifferent to the opinion of the public about the wide distribution of the image of the snowboarder with the Olympic banknote and are now studying the situation.
But Goznak is not too worried about the hype around the Olympic banknote.
Head of the press service of Gosznak Natalia Nikiforova told Izvestia that all the arguments about plagiarism are ridiculous.
The snowboarder on the banknote turned to the right, on the photos in the network - to the left, - said Nikiforova.
The person in the photo shoot to create the bill was removed from different points, then the final image was selected, on it - the characteristic position of the snowboarder.
She also noted that copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic banknote, as the artist received a salary for his work.
According to experts, the discussion around the image on the Olympic bill is quite positive.
Recognition of the image on the bill - a plus for its promotion, - said the Executive Director of the NP "RusBrand" Alexei Popovichev.
It is quite difficult to prove the one hundred percent similarity of the images on the banknote and in photo banks, so lawsuits to challenge the intellectual property of this image are unlikely to come.
For the first time the Olympic banknote appeared in China - for the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008, a commemorative banknote of 10 yuan was issued.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Legislative bans forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
According to their estimates, beer consumption in the country next year will remain at the same level, and this is at best.
Initially, the company was looking for growth.
After all, this year is bad for them: sales fell by 7 percent.
All this was told by the head of one of the largest brewing companies in the country, the chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers Isaac Sheps at the III annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute "Commodities of Daily Demand in Russia", which has just ended in Moscow.
It discussed state regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already declined by 18 percent, since in recent years the country has seen a significant increase in the regulation of the brewing industry in terms of production and turnover of beer - a drink with a low alcohol content, - said Sheps.
No country in the world has such a strict restriction of the beer market, the unpredictable introduction of more and more illogical prohibitions, which are justified by the alleged fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewer complained that many legislative bans designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse do not have much impact, however, new initiatives are constantly emerging.
The most painful for beer producers was hit by the ban imposed since this year to sell alcohol in kiosks.
“We immediately lost 35,000 consumers,” said Isaac Sheps.
Next year, the brewers have two forecasts.
Optimistic - the one that Sheps talked about: sales of a foam drink will remain at the same level.
Pessimistic - will fall by another 2-3 percent.
To save their profits, businessmen are forced to move away from varieties designed for the mass consumer, to the "premium" class: beer will become less, but it will cost more.
Meanwhile, the radical consequences of falling sales with a small amount of alcohol are not yet visible.
"According to my observations, the level of diseases of alcoholism remains approximately at the same level," - said the doctor-narcologist Alexei Sotnikov.
However, the proportion of patients who use surrogates of strong drinks, as well as those who "settled" on alcohol-containing tonic drinks such as "Jaguar", increased, while ten years ago it was "beer" alcoholism that prevailed.
In September, 600 people were dismissed from the Ford automobile plant in Vsevolozhsk.
As they say in trade unions, all dismissed received compensation.
However, the question of reducing industrial production in the region is much more acute than the problems of workers.
Deputy of the regional Zaksa Alexey Etmanov at the meeting said that the plant of the company "Ford" in Vsevolozhsk reduced about 600 people.
According to him, this happened in September: then under the voluntary dismissal program, which was developed together with the union of the organization, about 600 people left the plant.
Workers who decided to resign of their own free will were offered “golden parachutes” in the amount of several salaries.
Because of this, the vast majority left jobs of their own free will.
However, according to Atmanov, such a number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think it's gonna be limited.
However, in the next two years, the authorities do not plan to adopt any programs to support regional enterprises in difficulty," he explained, adding that the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and a large reduction in jobs when adopting the budget.
At Ford, this information is neither disproved nor confirmed.
We are waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as it appears, we will definitely publish it.
Talks about the reduction of workers at the Ford plant in Vsevolozhsk have been going on for a long time.
For example, the company’s plans to lay off 600 people became known in September.
Earlier, the plant announced the suspension of production of cars.
The reason for the plant was the drop in demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrostat, according to the results of nine months of 2013, the volume of industrial production in the Leningrad region decreased by 5.4%.
The production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5%.
In the United States, it will be possible to use mobile phones during the takeoff and landing of the aircraft
New rules for the safe use of mobile devices during takeoff and landing of the airliner have been approved in the United States, according to the BBC.
U.S. airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, with the new rules set to take effect by the end of 2013.
However, communication with the Internet for receiving and sending e-mail will be prohibited during flights at altitudes below 3 kilometers.
Due to the risk of interference to aircraft radio equipment, cellular voice communications will continue to be banned.
Thus, passengers of flights will be allowed to read e-books, play games on tablets and other gadgets and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to check the safety of using electronic devices during the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the US Federal Aviation Administration that they will be able to cope with the alleged impact of mobile on aircraft and aircraft control devices.
According to the source, following the example of the United States, the UK may also revise the current rules for the use of electronic devices in flight.
The “Russian mafia” in the United States finally fixed a new name – “Brotherly Circle”
This week, the blacklist of the “Russian mafia” in America was replenished with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Treasury Department introduced into the “Brotherly Circle” three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli.
One of the Russians was the famous singer Grigory Leps, whom the United States suspects of transporting money for members of the group.
In total, 22 people involved in the “Brotherly Circle” and six affiliated organizations are on the U.S. blacklist.
However, many experts doubt that such an organization really exists.
"The 'Brotherly Circle' statement is more like an attempt to bring together disparate criminal groups," said Mark Galeotti, an expert on organized crime and a professor at New York University.
In his opinion, the “Brotherly Circle” reflects the popular perception of the “Russian mafia”.
“I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement or anywhere else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization,” Mr Galeotti was quoted as saying by the US Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Professor Liz Shelley of George Mason University agrees with Mr Galeotti.
“If they act together, it’s more like a criminal network, but not an organization,” the Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime said.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the “Brotherly Circle” unites more closely the Russian thief in the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as Grandfather Hassan.
The criminal authority was killed in January of this year.
Thus, the activities of Lasha Shushanashvili and Zakharia Kalashova, who added to the list in 2012, were closely related to Grandpa Hassan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was Grandpa Hassan’s nephew.
However, Mr. Galeotti noted that some of the personalities were not related to Usoyan.
In his view, all of them shared rather common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion in the "Brotherly Circle" of Grigory Leps - the favorite singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin - attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we expect to receive more detailed information from our American colleagues-partners, in connection with which such a decision was made, why it was included in such lists, - said the press Secretary of the head of state Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, his interests will be protected.
Gazprom CEO Alexey Miller says Bulgaria’s pipeline marks a new era in the gas sector
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the head of Gazprom said.
“Today, a landmark event has taken place: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller said in a statement Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is designed to diversify Russia’s export routes through Europe.
The dispute over the contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which contains most of Russia’s European-bound gas, raises the risk level for conventional routes, officials say.
Miller said a direct link with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries have been eliminated “forever.”
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced price as soon as the entire project starts working in 2015.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other countries further along the pipeline route by the end of the year.
The pipeline’s annual design capacity is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA Officers Charged with Sexual Offences Before Jonathan Lord Charges, Royal Commission Reveals
Two YMCA NSW employees were charged with child sex crimes before charges were brought in 2011 against an employee of a childcare facility in Karingbach, Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse said.
But in its opening statement, the commission said it had “never dealt with cases of child sexual abuse within its organization.”
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about one case where a YMCA employee was accused of child pornography offences and another case where a gym instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual offences against children under his custody in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew of the first case but did not know of the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA had also made an inaccuracy in its opening statement to the commission, arguing that “there have been external YMCA inspections that have acknowledged that the YMCA is at the forefront of ensuring children’s safety.”
The evidence presented to the commission suggests that YMCA was notified that it had received the second-to-last of four possible assessments following a quality audit carried out by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who joined the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that he and lower management had failed to hire Lord and also failed to provide a clear understanding of the staff’s obligations regarding reporting child safety policy violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys during his two years at the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the suggestion that YMCA’s corporate ethics prevented employees from reporting Lord’s violations of child safety.
The staff testified that they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with the children, personally tended them, put them on his lap, said that he loved one of them and allowed them to play with his mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under the Lord's guidance and asked to be trained in child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that she had found Jackie Barnath, the childcare manager of the YMCA's Caringbach branch, who was the Lord's head, "very intimidating and often difficult to access."
The Executive Director said that he did not accept staff members ' explanations that they were embarrassed to report the situation to their superiors.
Rather, he said, their friendship with the Lord led them away from the idea of having to report him.
Mr Hare said he had presented to the New South Wales YMCA Council his view that the lesson for the organisation from the “Jonathan Lord incident” was not “concerning the provision of information” by staff and the council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the allegations emerged was made by YMCA’s director general for child custody, Liam Whitley.
He said it was designed to prevent evidence from being corrupted, but was "overdone" and the decision was poorly implemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a child-safe organization during Jonathan Lord's tenure between 2009 and 2011, said Professor Stephen Smallbone, a child molestation expert at Griffith University.
He said there were “serious problems” in recruiting, selecting, instructing, training and supervising staff.
The hearing is adjourned until December 20.
Fashion Week in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo.
At home, she is considered not just a model, but a real star.
Despite the fact that Giselle Bundschen left her job for a while, having been distracted by motherhood, these days and this week she came to the parade on purpose.
Many months of absence did not prevent her from retaining her place on the podium and on the pedestal.
Giselle remains the highest paid supermodel in the world.
This time she participated in the Kolcchi brand parade.
The final of the fashion week is usually the most interesting shows.
Sort of like what the stylist Lino Villaventura arranged.
For more than 30 years, in parallel with the production of pret-a-porte luxury class, the fashion designer is actively working in theater and cinema, making performances and developing costumes for many famous paintings.
In total, more than 30 thousand firms and companies that are related to the textile industry and the fashion world took part in the final fashion week in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo.
It is one of the most dynamically developing areas of production, employing more than 2 million Brazilians, and the annual turnover reaches 50 billion dollars.
Tony Blair has said he will take the chance of returning as Britain’s prime minister, but admits a return is unlikely.
The night before, in an interview dedicated to the fifth anniversary of his departure from his post, the 59-year-old politician outlined his views on various aspects of domestic politics.
Since stepping down in June 2007, after ten years as leader, Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador to the four Middle East peacekeepers.
Asked if he would return to the post of prime minister, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said: “Yes, of course, but it is unlikely to happen, so...”
The head coach of Milan Massimiliano Allegri expressed regret over the draw in the match of the 10th round of the championship of Italy with Lazio.
The specialist also noted that failures at the start are due to a series of injuries of leading players.
I am very sorry that we did not manage to win, - Tmw quotes the words of Allegri.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first half, we didn't let Lazio do anything.
In the second, the Romans added, but in general I can not say that we lost concentration.
I should have won.
“Last season we had the task of getting into the Champions League.
Now we are behind schedule, but this is due to a series of injuries of key players.
Rami and Honda?
They are very good players with character.
However, our composition is still good.
Look at Kaka, who had a high-level meeting.
The horse racing experts who come to Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year prize knew that the competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for the appearance of three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months before taking his first steps, this kid with his pet Shetland pony Toffee lynx rushed through three rounds to easily take the top prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable pair – of the same height – received high marks for appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition, which is held by the Sunnybank equestrian center in the city of Radry near Cardiff.
Coming out into the public eye against the background of men and women in elegant wetsuit hats, he shifted his cap and proudly walked around the two-year-old Toffee.
The judges praised Fenton for his highly developed innate ability to handle horses.
And Toffee received the highest rating for appearance and character.
Fenton was gifted to Toffee on his third birthday last March, and since then he has been practicing with a Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said, "Phenton and Toffee make a beautiful duet."
They had many rivals, but these two left with a gold cup and rosacea.
It was just his second performance with Toffee and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely unfamiliar people in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Ebb Vale in South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been exhibiting horses for over 10 years.
Ms. Howells said: “The whole audience was amazed and everyone was shouting approving cheers and clapping.”
He ran across the sand across the entire length of the arena and, although he looked so tiny, he did his job perfectly.
Fenton is crazy about animals — he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chickens he cares for.
Judging by the way he started, he will soon be taking part in Horse of the Year – and I’m sure he will perform well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: “Phenton is only three years old, but he knows how to handle his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
The judges praised Fenton and Toffee for their appearance and how they presented themselves in the show ring.
They assess the consistency of the performance of the pony and the breeder - Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I’m sure Fenton was helped by his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.
The Chinese newspaper that published the appeal “is subject to reorganization”
The Chinese newspaper, which published on the front page a call for the release of the accused in the defamation of the reporter, should be reorganized, according to the regulator of the press.
The Guangzhou-based New Express newspaper made an unexpected public statement asking for the release of journalist Chen Yunzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he took bribes for writing false articles about a state-owned company.
Now the “New Express” has to go through the “process of complete correction of errors”, as reported by the regulator.
The “correction order” came from the Guangdong Office of Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation revealed that Yangcheng Evening News Group-owned newspaper New Express published several false reports about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The leadership of the editorial staff of the New Express was disoriented,” the regulator said in a statement.
He said the decision was made “to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yunzhou in the form of the revocation of his reporter’s license.”
He also “ordered the Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete correction of the New Express errors and recommended that it investigate the situation-related responsible persons of the newspaper and make immediate changes to the management of the New Express.”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express in which he claimed financial misconduct at a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two front-page calls for his release, saying that it supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television with an admission that he had published false articles for money.
“In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to earn public trust,” he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I craved money and fame.
I realized my guilt.
After Mr. Chen’s confessions, the New Express issued an apology on the front page, saying the newspaper had failed to properly check his reports.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say the practice of making confessions in China is still widespread, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to self-censorship.
U.S.-Mexico drug tunnel equipped with its own railroad discovered
Found one of the most difficult tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
U.S. authorities have described the four-by-three-foot tunnel as one of the most difficult secret passages they have ever discovered.
This tunnel, whose zigzags make up the length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near the city of Tijuana (Mexico) and San Diego (USA).
This area is filled with inconspicuous warehouses, which facilitates the hidden loading of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were smuggled through, authorities said.
According to court documents, law enforcement officers confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was discovered.
The three men, who police said were drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distribution.
If convicted, they face prison terms ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were discovered in central Mexico after a marijuana harvest in October that posed a challenge to drug cartels to quickly deliver their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a roughly 700-yard-long passageway equipped with rail tracks that ran from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two San Diego warehouses.
Pensions have increased in Belarus since November
Pensions have been increasing in Belarus since November this year, BelTA correspondent at the main pension insurance department of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection reported.
From November 1 of this year, the average wages of workers in the republic, applied in the previous recalculation of pensions, will be adjusted with an increase in its value by 5.4% and the corresponding recalculation of labor pensions will be made in accordance with the decree of October 21, 2013 No. 478 "On the increase of pensions".
As a result of the recalculation, from November, labor pensions by age will increase, according to an estimate, by an average of 5.3%.
The average pension by age will be Br2 million. 295 thousand.
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million residents of the republic.
The expenses of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Belarus for the payment of pensions in increased amounts from November this year will increase by Br274.3 billion per month.
Simultaneously with the recalculation of labor pensions in November this year, the minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and supplements to pensions will be recalculated due to the increase in the budget of the subsistence minimum on average per capita.
BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the government in the amount of Br1 million 47 thousand 530 - 2.1% higher than in the period from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, from November 1, the minimum labor pensions, social pensions and allowances, increases and supplements to pensions will be increased by 2.1%.
In Belarus, more than Br53 trillion was pledged to pay pensions in 2013, taking into account the increase in pensions.
British police hand over extradition notice to Assange
British police have handed over a notice of extradition to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and asked for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had handed the 40-year-old Australian a “formal surrender request” to appear at a police station, adding that if he did not comply with that requirement he would continue to be subject to arrest.
Assange faces extradition to Sweden on sexual offences charges after he exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his extradition appeal earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, he took refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
“Scotland Yard has handed the 40-year-old a formal request to surrender, which obliges him to arrive at the police station on the day and time of our choosing,” the spokesman said.
He continues to violate bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on the notification to the police.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the U.S. to face possible espionage charges following the publication of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks.
A driver driving 130 miles an hour with a hot drink between his legs has been fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000.
The driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving at speeds of up to 130 mph (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
Andrew Howey, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to take between his legs.
In the peace court of Colchester, Howie admitted the charge of driving without due diligence and attention.
The addition of seven penalty points to his driving licence resulted in a six-month driving ban.
Howey was also ordered to pay a <0xC2><0xA3>90 fee and an additional <0xC2><0xA3>100 fee to help crime victims.
Tax for foreign property owners will lead to the fact that the London bubble will burst
The Treasury has made a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax measure, but expects a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who introduced a 7% state duty rate in the 2012 budget for homes worth more than <0xC2><0xA3>2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own homes in partnership rather than as individuals.
At the moment, the state duty on residential property in the Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea districts, which amounted to 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 fiscal year, already exceeds the total amount for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, the North West, Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: “After the increase in state duties on expensive homes and the introduction of related anti-avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that the taxation of expensive real estate is understated regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system.”
“But this move could lead to some foreign investors being reluctant to buy property in London or the current owners not wanting to sell it,” he added.
The cost of first-class real estate – the top 5–10% of the housing market by price – in London’s rich south-west belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose by a record 11.8% over the past year.
According to a study by Savills, prices in central London continued to grow at a steady 5.6% year-on-year rate, but they were eclipsed by an actively developing “domestic market” with a surge in prices in the south-west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) of the city.
Scientists have shed light on how the movements of the dog’s tail are related to its mood.
Earlier studies have shown that satisfied dogs wagging their tail to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while anxious dogs wagging their tail predominantly to the left.
But now scientists say other members of the canine family can spot and respond to these subtle differences in tail wagging.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, says: “It is well known that in humans, the left and right sides of the brain are involved in different ways in the formation of stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at this and other species.
He added that, just like humans, dogs’ right brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs respond to the diverse barking of other dogs’ tails, the researchers observed the animals as they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
We will probably soon understand why their tails sometimes point in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed the dogs videos of the dogs – either naturalistic versions or a silhouette to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the movement of the tail and direct the tail more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw that the otherwise unexpressed dog moved its tail to the right (in terms of the tail-wagging dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail stooped predominantly to the left (again from the point of view of the tailed dog), their heartbeats increased and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs learned from their experience which movements they should worry about and which ones they shouldn’t.
He observes: “If there are multiple encounters with other dogs and often their tails in one direction are associated with more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, then the dog reacts based on this experience.”
The researchers say these findings could give owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of their animal’s emotions.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting research fellow at the University of Bristol’s School of Veterinary Medicine, said this was not the first study to test whether left and right sides matter to dogs.
Last year, a group of scientists from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog, and to the right when looking at a happy dog.
And in another study at the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: “Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its tail was pointing to the left rather than the right, instead of becoming alarmed — the opposite of the Italian study.”
He said the differences could have been due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in movies or robot dogs as dogs.
It might be useful to study how dogs respond to real dogs, he explained.
“While there is sufficient evidence for different mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details have yet to be clarified, and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, we will probably soon understand why their tails sometimes point in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys Delay Concert in Glasgow Due to Alex Turner's Illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed a concert in Glasgow after its vocalist was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield band was due to perform at the city’s Hydro concert venue on Friday.
However, the illness of vocalist Alex Turner forced them to postpone the show.
The statement came after the band was forced to postpone a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: “Following the decision to move the show to Birmingham’s LG Arena tonight and following a medical request, Arctic Monkeys also have to postpone the show at Hydro’s venue in Glasgow on Friday, 1 November.”
“Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis and unfortunately is not able to perform.”
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, and the show in Glasgow at the Hydro site will be held on November 21.
All tickets for these shows remain valid.

Pope Francis to name first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will raise the new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his term of office on February 22, as announced by the Vatican on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and it is they who elect the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will ultimately participate in the selection of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope – this is the prerogative of a group of 120 “cardinal electors”.
In announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said a meeting of all current cardinals known as the Consistory would be held before the ceremony.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene a consistory in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electors is likely to decline by February.
He said the pope usually calls as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of electoral cardinals back to 120, as well as as as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wishes.
The consistory next year will be of great importance because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, according to Valero.
At the moment, there is a kind of bias in favor of Europe and especially in favor of Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance,” he said.
In South America, forty percent of Catholics live, but they are represented by a small number of cardinals.
They will also be the first elected cardinals since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the father decided everything on his own.
“Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it was “quite possible” that Francis would turn to the cardinals for advice.
But we haven’t been in this situation before – it’s the first time for us.
Valero said that the popes usually raised cardinal bishops from large parishes, but Francis “is full of surprises – so we don’t know who he will name.”
GM recalls a number of new pickups in the United States to finalize the seat backs
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to address manual seat-back tilting issues, according to a notice from U.S. vehicle safety regulators Friday.
In some of the pickups, the front seats may have a defect in the backrest tilt mechanism.
As a result, the seat backs do not meet federal head restraint safety standards.
“In a rear-end collision, the head restraint may not adequately protect the driver and passengers, increasing the risk of injury,” the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a notice posted on its website.
Recalled models were manufactured in the period from August 1 to September 10.
The production of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important launch of the car into mass production for a leading American automaker since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owners of the pickups about the defect in the first half of October.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could not consider notifying owners of the 16-day government shutdown, which slowed car sales growth in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were upgraded for the 2014 model range, rose about 20 percent during the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon rose 1.4 percent to $ 37.47.
Criticism of Obama's Voter Desperation
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change.
He says Obama allowed Republican obstructionism to frustrate laudable efforts.
Obstructionism cannot serve as a justification for problems with the website of the Obama-reforming health care system, drone attacks
The Obama campaign memoirs of 2008 are a sad reminder of what could have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard University.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
I thought that this book would inspire me during my somber second year of medical school and revive a sense of hope in me.
It’s called “Courage to Win,” and it’s a memoir of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing patient reports in the evening and go to bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and performances could be breathtaking.
The election victory was impressive, and news anchors paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates were crying with joy, and my parents were guarding all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of strategists was to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, his support rate was 82%.
Then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a rude awakening, like pulling out of a dream.
It’s hard to remember those days of optimism – they seem like a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I dropped my first ballot, change has really happened.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I pay tribute to Obama for his great and varied accomplishments, from passing the Affordable Care Act to withdrawing our military from Iraq, repealing the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” rule, and killing Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, the choice of public health, and the closure of the Guantanamo base among others.
But after countless times that I have sided with the Obama administration in defending it in front of colleagues and peers, I have run out of explanations that I can provide.
I have reached a point of political desperation.
Republican obstructionism cannot explain permission to wiretap foreign leaders or drone strikes on innocent children in other countries.
It cannot explain the National Security Agency’s collection of data on Americans’ private lives or the prosecution of whistleblowers exposing the government’s misconduct.
He cannot explain the murder of an American citizen, Anwar al-Awlaki, without trial or investigation, or the failure to comply with limits on government funding and spending during presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the report’s findings, which say the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And lately, he can’t justify failing to develop a simple website for more than three years after signing the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Should I have known at the age of 18 that leadership could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it?
It is obvious that the work in the elected office is not a predictable program of action, because our public dialogue will be formed by the opposition political party and such random events as the massacre in Newtown.
Nevertheless, it is clear from all the examples I have listed above that they were largely the administration's own choice.
And that's what worries me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and crude alternative, it seemed that he was unable to make a decision on his own policies or views.
I believed that in his second term, Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections, would live up to the hopes we had heard about for so long.
However, when Obama’s approval rating fell below 45% this week, it became much more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
It makes me yearn for the many promises that have flown by.
This week I read the part of the book that describes how Clinton dealt Obama a stunning defeat in the Pennsylvania primary.
At a meeting to analyze the reasons for the failure, he told his staff that they should get back on track and stay true to their goal.
“I want us to bring back our attraction,” he said.
We have to remember who we are.”
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.

Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the issue of parental leave.
Billionaire lawmaker Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over parental leave because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining tycoon, who has an unresolved dispute over the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, made the statement at a time when he was trying to brush aside questions about whether he had a conflict.
Palmer’s United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial in deciding whether to abolish taxes on carbon emissions and mining.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest, and said Mr. Abbott’s daughters would personally benefit from the policy measures.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not they get leave,” Mr. Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner in the race for the Sunshine Coast seat of the Fairfax constituency by a margin of 53 votes after a recount.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the electoral counting procedure in order to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should a decision on this election be made two months after we have voted?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn’t we have a system so we can come in, enter our data into the computer, vote immediately and get the result at 18:30 the same evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils for ballots.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
To use a pencil in our time seems strange.
The Electoral Commission is exploring e-voting opportunities and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his programme included an international airport for Sunshine Coast and he would take his new job “very seriously”.
Public office involves service to society.
“We are not seeking any awards other than the appreciation of history for the fact that at a critical moment we can serve this district,” he said.
RBS suspends two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland temporarily suspended two traders in its foreign exchange unit, according to two people familiar with the situation, which is another confirmation that the global verification by regulators of the alleged manipulations in the foreign exchange market is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations related to the world’s largest financial market, which has a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
The two traders will be the first RBS employees to be suspended in an unfolding investigation that echoes the LIBOR interbank rate manipulation scandal.
Refusing to comment on the suspension, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from regulators this month.
“Our ongoing investigation into this matter is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators,” the bank said in a statement two weeks ago.
Last month, insiders said RBS had handed over email records and instant messages that were received and sent by its former trader to the UK’s regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is known to have been granted leave in his current position as head of European spot forex trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Mr. Usher’s IM contact group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to insiders.
UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged currency market manipulation at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators in the world — the European Commission, Finma, Swiss antitrust authority Weko, FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — are considering allegations that bankers conspired to influence the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also began internal checks or received requests for information from regulators, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks look at instant messages and emails for several years in search of cases of offenses.
News of the inspections has roiled traders in a business that has been one of the biggest sources of revenue for investment bank trading units in recent years, but has struggled this year as low currency volatility reduces opportunities for traders.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the gravity of the situation by saying that a vast and highly liquid currency market is virtually impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trading in the forex market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the wider use by banks of their internal platforms means that “you can start to influence the market at a very small price.”
The news came the same day Credit Suisse announced it had fired one of its London Stock Exchange traders this week, after it caused losses of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperates with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader acted alone and that this issue was able to be localized,” Credit Suisse said.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care law
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled today that Barack Obama’s landmark health care law is constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
By a vote of 5 to 4, the judges ruled that separate regulations under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requiring citizens to purchase health insurance before 2014 or pay a fine are constitutional under the government’s powers to tax.
Supreme Court President John Roberts joined the four more liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were opposed.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of this 2700-page law and further ruled that the requirement of the health care law that states increase compliance with the Medicaid program requirements, otherwise they would lose all federal funding for the Medicaid program, is not unconstitutionally coercive.
The lawsuit to block the bill was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The bill was strongly opposed by each of the major Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary season, including purported candidate Mitt Romney.
Is football the cause of divorce?
In the State Duma, within the framework of the "Open Tribune", politicians and experts talked about how to preserve the national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was the following: to ban football in the North Caucasus, because from this game there are only scandals and discord.
Speaker Sergei Naryshkin recalled the recent events in Biryulev and said that in order to reduce the “degree of tension in society”, politicians and the media should be correct in their statements.
Probably, he was referring to the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one of the TV shows threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire, if they did not want to limit the birth rate.
All the speakers also spoke about measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries, and about measures to harmonize relations between the peoples inhabiting Russia, which gave the discussion confusion.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Biryulev - "a model conflict that could be predicted," but "for these questions we answer too many people and authorities," and seven babysitters a child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe has long practiced in relation to migrants, in the opinion of the public, has failed, and we need to find our way.
Historian Yuri Petrov placed great hopes on a new unified history textbook.
“It is still necessary to create a manual on the history of culture of the peoples of the country, so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know that people live in Dagestan, and vice versa,” he said.
Gennady Zyuganov proposed to introduce criminal liability for "calls for the dismemberment of Russia": "If in the United States to say on the radio that it is necessary to give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard "not to inflame".
As usual, he accused journalists of bringing sick and acute national problems to public discussion: “In the heat of controversy, there is little to say!”
The leader of the faction “United Russia” Vladimir Vasilyev immediately advised journalists to conclude a “charter” and agree to talk about this topic carefully, and then the same obligations can take and politicians.
We have adopted about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order in general is established, said Mr. Vasiliev.
As an example, he cited a law that placed regional and municipal authorities in charge of inter-ethnic peace on their territory.
But Lyudmila Andrichenko did not share her enthusiasm about this law: it does not have "clear ideas about what the adaptation of migrants is, about its mechanisms and limits.
Therefore, the subjects will interpret the scope of these powers differently.
In addition, the municipalities do not have the personnel necessary to solve such complex issues, there are no means, and the center does not give them methodological recommendations that they could use.
The head of the Duma Committee on Nationalities Hajimet Safaraliev proposed the creation of a special department with the ominous name "Ministry of National Security", which would deal with issues of national policy.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 90s headed a similar department, which was subsequently abolished, opposed it.
It is enough to have at the federal level a special person, a “minister without a portfolio”, who could be contacted, if anything.
“We are walking around the edge, shells are tearing up nearby, it is very important for representatives of different ethnicities and religions to stand together against provocations, and this work should receive decent information support,” said Vsevolod Chaplin, a spokesman for the Russian Orthodox Church’s communications department.
There should be no neutrality of the state in relation to dangerous ideologies, including religious ones, in his opinion.
Here Oleg Nilov led the discussion in an unexpected direction: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, you still need to look for, but they are pushed on the wrong path, on the wrong road," he said.
"The wrong way" is the development of football: "The football player is beaten by the whole crowd, then the flags are burned, then the comrades throw stones at each other ...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football.
There is another sport - rugby is called...
"They will not be equal in the world in this kind of sport!" - hotly said dovoross.
Nobody will play rugby in the Caucasus! - Mr. Zhirinovsky intervened immediately.
You'll offer them some more curling!
It is necessary to know the national characteristics, it is like offering a Georgian "Zaporozhets"" ...
In Yaroslavl wild behavior on the stands distinguished representatives of the Moscow club - during the game with the local club.
Football should be banned across the country.
The head of the control and disciplinary committee of the RFU Artur Grigoryants said that "Kuban" was fined 500 thousand rubles, transfers from the House of football correspondent "SE" Philip Papenkov.
Such sanctions against the Krasnodar club were applied for arson of the flag of Dagestan by fans in the rostrum during the home match of the 14th round against Anzhi.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a man from the RFPL.
We examined all available materials.
For improper behavior of the audience "Kuban" was fined 500 thousand rubles.
Against the companies Google, Samsung, Huawei filed claims for patents Nortel
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent lawsuits against mobile phone makers on Thursday, including Google, whose price it cut off at a Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought $4.5 billion in Nortel patents, filed patent infringement lawsuits in the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help match online search keywords to relevant ads, the lawsuit says, which is the backbone of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones running Google’s Android operating system, which fiercely competes with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered $900 million for Nortel’s patents.
Google raised its bid several times, eventually offering as much as $4.4 billion.
Having lost the Nortel patent case to the Rockstar consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in this transaction the determining factor was partly the Motorola patent library.
“Despite a failed attempt to acquire the patents at auction that are the subject of the lawsuit, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” the lawsuit says.
Rockstar is demanding increased damages from Google because it claims that Google’s patent infringement is intentional, according to the lawsuit.
Egypt's first freely elected president sworn in
Mohamed Morsi takes the oath of office, but the day of his triumph is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “new Egypt” when he was sworn in, becoming the country’s first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted 16 months ago.
In his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He was sworn in before 18 judges in black robes in a courthouse on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Morsi said during a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations of a new life — absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old American-educated engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that for most of its 84-year history has been a banned organization targeted by successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police when Morsi arrived with a small motorcade shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to greet the new president, and, unlike the Mubarak-era presidential pump, the movement was only stopped for a short time to let his motorcade pass along the normally busy road connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Although Morsi has been ridiculed as the uncharismatic “spare wheel” of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has grown dramatically since his victory and Friday speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only for Islamists but for all those who want to bring to an end the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak.
“Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Morsi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, to judges in a wood-paneled courtroom where he was sworn in.
Morsi later went to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural address.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra performing the national anthem, during which he stood at the counter “quietly”.
Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
His arrival was greeted by the slogan “Army and people – one hand”, which was chanted by hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a bulwark of secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s became a bulwark of Islamist student groups.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to return the powers the president has been stripped of by a military council that took matters from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before a court rather than before parliament, as is customary, he is carrying out the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi’s speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
The next meeting of the Association of Mechanical Engineers of the Tyumen region was held at the Yalutorovsky Automobile Plant.
Within the framework of the event, a presentation of a new line for the production of electric welded steel pipes was held.
According to the commercial director of the enterprise Denis Gribanov, in 2011, with the advent of a new owner, a marketing study was conducted to study the market for steel structures in the Tyumen region.
It turned out that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons of electric welded pipes per month.
After that, it was decided to change the profile of the plant and install equipment for their production on it.
Already this year, more than 7 thousand tons of products were shipped.
Investments in the plant amounted to more than 120 million rubles, - said Denis Gribanov.
In October, a new camp was launched, which allows you to increase the range.
The plant produces both a small pipe profile, which is used for household, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and large - for the construction industry.
We plan to reach the level of production of 50 thousand tons of products per year, which will be about 10 percent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, the number of employees in the enterprise has not decreased - now it is 157 people, in the plans for the purchase of new equipment - an increase in staff by more than 50 employees.
The company is retraining personnel, and the necessary specialists are selected from the existing ones.
Next year, it is planned to introduce a new unit of longitudinal cutting of steel up to five millimeters thick, which will reduce the cost of production, as well as another mill, with a pipe production rate of up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company is going to master the production of pipes, which are used in housing and communal services.
The management of the enterprise sets a task to cover up to 70 percent of the needs of the Tyumen region in these products.
Leonid Ostroumov, Deputy Director of the Investment Policy Department, addressing the heads of production, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of machine-building enterprises.
Forms of state support for industry are also aimed at this, which include reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of leasing it.
This year it is planned to allocate 150 million rubles for these purposes, two thirds of this amount has already been spent.
The last commission, which will consider subsidy contracts, accepts documents from enterprises until November 15.
In addition, the budget reimburses the costs of participation of local producers in international fairs.
For the next year, the budget provides for funds in the amount of 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate lease payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million for energy saving programs.
Funds for the reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment, which is produced in the south of the Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex, are reduced to 72 million rubles.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the future this form of support will cease, since the motive for its introduction was the compensation of the tax on mining, which oil companies paid to the regional budget.
At present, they do not, and subsidies are becoming the region's direct spending obligations.
In view of this, the government of the region considers the direct support of industrial enterprises as a priority, and not the financing of the oil industry through them.
The assistance of the budget will be related to investment projects that will be implemented in the production.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the current situation with oil workers.
The subsidy for the equipment purchased by them is a competitive advantage of the industry of the south of the Tyumen region, and when it is canceled, it will be difficult to compete at a price with the middle strip of Russia, where the labor force is cheaper.
In addition, the question of the continuity of the new owner of TNK-BP - the company Rosneft, which does not yet place its orders at Tyumen enterprises.
The agreement on the implementation of the Uvatsky project expires in 2013, and no application for its extension has been received.
Currently, enterprises in the southern region, which specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector, can not form a portfolio of orders for the next year.
The question remains whether taxes on oil produced in the Uvatsky district will go to the budget of the region or they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the fields.
Tomic will work 240 hours for an extremist video in the social network
The Leninsky district court of Tomsk sentenced to 240 hours of mandatory work of a resident of the city, who posted a video of extremist orientation in the social network, a spokesman for the press service of the regional court told RIA Novosti on Friday.
According to the court, in March 2013, the man posted a video on his page in the popular social network, which was included in the federal list of extremist materials.
In relation to him, a criminal case was initiated under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity, as well as humiliating the dignity of a person committed in public."
“The Leninsky district court considered this case in a special order and found the man guilty of the above crime, imposing a penalty in the form of 240 hours of mandatory work”, – said the Agency interlocutor.
She added that the man fully admitted his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians the collapse of prices for goods after the signing of the Association with the European Union
Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will drop significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He said this during a conversation with readers of his page on Facebook.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
So, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the provision on the Free Trade Area, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will decrease significantly.
This means that prices should also go down.
“This is about goods that come from EU countries,” Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be indirect.
But there shouldn’t be any price increases either.
Therefore, messages on billboards, which have recently appeared in our country a lot, that the association with the EU is a rise in prices, this is not quite true, or to be more precise - not at all," Azarov said.
Investigators check information on child abuse in Biysk
On 29 October, the media reported that a kindergarten teacher in Biysk had locked a child in a basement for educational purposes.
At present, investigators are clarifying all the circumstances, as well as giving a legal assessment of the actions of kindergarten staff.
After the accusation of bad taste Evgenia Vasilyeva spoke
Evgenia Vasilyeva, whose person attracted close attention of the media for almost a year, has never commented on numerous publications in the press about thefts in the Ministry of Defense, and about her personally - relations with former Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov, her poetry and addiction to valuable things.
However, on November 1, the defendant in the “Oboronservice” case broke the silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasilyeva said: “Initially, of course, the task was exactly one: to pull out of me any negative information about the former defense minister.”
There's been blackmail about me having to testify or I'm going to go to jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
We will go to court and prove our innocence.
We are 100% sure of victory.
At the same time, it can be concluded from the interview that, perhaps, most of all, Vasilyev was hurt by the words that she did not care about taste.
Probably, this refers to the statement of the official representative of the IC of the Russian Federation Vladimir Markin that in the collection of paintings, which was collected by the defendant in the case of "Oboronservice", fakes were found.
Among the arrested property there are a number of paintings, which the mistress, being confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the art examination, appointed by the investigators after the arrest of these paintings, established that they have no artistic value and, simply put, are cheap fakes,” Markin said in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Department of Defense...
Then they admitted that they were not stolen from the Ministry of Defense, while they said that I was bad with taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss any personal moments?
In my opinion, this is just lawlessness," Vasilyeva says.
When asked if she admitted her guilt in at least one of the 12 criminal episodes attributed to her, Vasilyeva said: "Of course not.
There's nothing to admit.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation in question.
They're just misleading people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation that Vasilyeva is evading the study of the materials of the criminal case, the lawyer of the defendant said that he and his client "the investigator does not allow to get acquainted with the materials of the case."
What caused the revelations under house arrest Vasilyeva, who has not yet communicated with the press?
Perhaps, as a woman, she could not fail to respond to the accusation of bad taste?
Or are the Komsomolka journalists right when they claimed a couple of days ago that she “fell into an even bigger trance under house arrest” because of the news of Anatoly Serdyukov’s reconciliation with his wife and his return to the bosom of the family?
The well-known military observer of the "KP" Viktor Baranets in his article "Serdyukov returned to his wife?" wrote: "Investigators do not exclude that after such a shock she can become more talkative in interrogations."
Earlier, Vasilyeva took some accusations of illegal sale of real estate of the Ministry of Defense.

From fungicides in the fall, it is better to choose copper-containing drugs, for example, a 1% Bordeaux mixture or preparations of Abiga-Pik, Oxychom, Ordan, etc.
Do you think travel agents are a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be seeing the opposite trend.
The company has updated its full-year profit forecast and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel firm now expects its main full-year pre-tax profit to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared to a previous forecast of between $305 million and $315 million.
If current benchmarks are met, this would represent a 12 to 17 percent increase from the record profit of $290.4 million earned in 2011/2012.
Managing Director Graham Turner said Flight Centre made an 8 percent profit in the first half and started the second half with good results, especially on weekday trips in Australia and the UK.
“Since the beginning of the year, we have been operating profitably across our 10 countries, and for some of them, a record high profit is expected for the full year, before interest and tax contributions are deducted,” he said.
“This includes Australia and the UK, which usually bring us the biggest profits.”
In Australia, leisure business recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a somewhat weaker domestic corporate travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre’s leisure business was doing well, while corporate customers were spending less.
Its U.S. business offset losses suffered during the seasonally weak first half of the year and is expected to make a profit for the third full year in a row.
Yesterday, the shares of Flight Centre rose by 3 cents to $ 38.20.
On October 31, Barnaul police identified two game halls.
The first one worked in the Industrial District on Vzletnaya Street.
At the time of the check in the institution was a game.
The club counted 24 machines.
Another gaming club was found in the Leninsky district on Anton Petrov Street.
There were 20 slot machines.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia on Barnaul reports that administrative materials on the article "Illegal organization and conduct of gambling" have been compiled.
The tech's gone.
In the near future, materials on these facts will be sent to the courts of the Industrial and Leninsky districts of the city.
In Yekaterinburg, a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Yekaterinburg, police are searching for a criminal who brutally murdered two sisters.
After they were killed, their bodies were burned.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Sverdlovsk region, the day before in the Kirov district of the Ural capital after extinguishing the fire in a three-room apartment located in a residential building on the street Ural, found the bodies of two women with signs of violent death.
The identities of the dead were soon established.
It turned out that these are sisters, one of them is a resident of Yekaterinburg for 44 years, the second is a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg region.
The apartment burned down a few days ago.
His investigation was taken under the personal control of the chief police officer of the region Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs bodies work out various versions of the murder, check the alibis of previously convicted citizens and persons prone to such acts.
In addition, it is established for what purpose women rented an apartment, and where they lived before, what they did, with whom they maintained relations.
Schools urged to pay more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British fiction starting in 1914.
The exam will also feature extra-curricular texts to encourage more extensive reading.
The combined course of English Literature and Language will be cancelled.
From 2015, students will be required to take a separate final exam in the language, with persistent recommendations for choosing English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education is set to release new curricula in English and mathematics tomorrow — the first subjects to undergo a radical overhaul.
It will make changes to other core subjects next year.
Separately, the OFQUAL exam regulatory body will present a revised structure for high school final exams, with a new grading system and less coursework.
Speaking in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was "a broad consensus that we need to reform our exam system to restore public confidence", insisting that school graduation exams would be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies show that English schools devote less time to math (116 hours a year, or three hours a week for a quarter) than in most countries.
For comparison, Australian schools give an average of 143 hours a year, and in Singapore students study about 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to spend more time on the math schedule, sources in the coalition said that large-scale school math final exams combined with an increased score in the rankings table are likely to provide an incentive for schools to provide additional instruction in the subject.
In the curriculum, more attention will be paid to “real-life tasks,” including financial mathematics.
Tickets to Heihe will cost tourists 2,200 rubles
From tomorrow, from Blagoveshchensk to Heihe, tourists will begin to carry ships on an air cushion.
For those who want to travel to China, this means additional spending
A ticket for a cougar is traditionally much more expensive than for a ship.
As reported in the information service of the company "AmurASSO", the cost of a regular ticket will be 2 200 rubles.
A trip through the hall of high comfort will cost 2,800 rubles.
By the way, this season the tickets did not rise in price: at the same price the cougars carried tourists last spring, and a year ago - in the fall.
Dmitry Medvedev: Russia’s GDP growth rate is not enough for the development of the state
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that the growth rate of its GDP is insufficient for Russia and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the conditions for lending to business and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation.
We had planned this year for GDP growth in the region of 3%, maybe even slightly more.
It will actually be less than 2%.
Against the background of a recession in a number of European countries, it seems not very bad, but it is not enough for us, because the economic base is not as powerful as in a number of countries, and in general, in order to develop, there must be higher rates.
Now it is very important that Russian companies, Russian businesses receive normal loans at a normal price - this is the first thing that must be done," the head of government stressed.

Travel through mud, rivers and the jungle to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in the countryside of Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend nearly every weekend taking in hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in this West African country – only one in 5,000 people.
Vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 main characters of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main characters to make him the CNN Hero of the Year.
This man will receive $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his father come back to life and fall unconscious again, wandering through hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but the resulting infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that reminded him of himself for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
If we had the money, we would have taken it out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle accompanied his father for years in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving whatever treatment they could get.
“It’s not easy,” Bwelle said.
You can leave home at 5 a.m., run to the hospital to be the first, but you’re not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some may die because of what they have to wait for.
The situation hasn’t changed much since Bwelle’s father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one doctor per 5,000 people.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 people.
And even if Cameroonians could go to the doctor, many of them would be out of pocket.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of healthcare spending in it is private.
“Their only problem is poverty,” Bwelle said.
“And because of poverty, they can’t enjoy their lives.”
Seeing the suffering of his father and so many of his compatriots, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free surgeries.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes trips to the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 other people packed into vans, tied medical supplies to roofs and drove across rough terrain to visit villages in need of help.
They are not always lucky.
More than once they had to push cars across rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted like real heroes: it is a holiday with songs and dances and the best rooms that the locals have to offer.
Free medical care in these villages is indeed a cause for celebration, and Bwelle with his wide smile and boundless energy is more than happy to join in the fun.
The next morning, the team began to receive hundreds of patients.
“We take 500 people on every trip,” Bwelle said.
They come from all over the county within a 60-kilometer radius of the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates — documents needed for school that many poor families simply can’t afford.
In the evenings, the brigade conducts simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school, municipality or home building; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the postoperative area to make room for the next person.
Using a generator to light up the operating and sanitation equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
This is an overwhelming pace, but the brigade’s determination is usually helped by the support of village musicians.
“They beat the drums all night to keep us awake and working,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the members of the brigade go back to the city, tired, but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, has conducted 700 free surgeries over the past year, and they know that their help can be of great importance to those they help.
One person explained that the free hernia treatment he received would allow him to work again.
“It will change the future for me and my family,” the man said.
In addition to these weekend clinical appointments and hospital work, Bwelle also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
It is this latter work, he said, that provides 60% of the funding for his non-profit organization; the rest is covered by private donations.
“I don’t even know when he’s sleeping,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in the Bwelle group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so that it can continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses like O’Malley, coming from the U.S. and Europe to join Bwell in carrying out his tasks, this is a practice opportunity they would never get at home.
“We were able to assist in surgeries where we helped remove blood stains or hold tools for Dr. Bwelle,” O’Malley said.
As a second-year student, you would never get that opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medication.
But upon arrival in Yaoundé, their food, transportation, and training are paid for by Bwelle.
“He’s a hero, no doubt,” O’Malley said.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, almost constant workload is not a difficult test.
To help others live a happy life, to fulfill the promise given to his father is what brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle said.
- And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh, to reduce their pain.
Go to the ASCOVIME website and see what you can do to help.
Snowden has agreed to testify about the wiretapping of Merkel
Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Strebele met with Edward Snowden in Moscow.
During the conversation, the question was discussed whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the Prosecutor General’s Office of Germany in the case of a possible wiretapping of the phone of the German Chancellor by US special services.
Snowden has expressed his readiness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear,” said Hans-Christian Strebele, “that he knows a great deal.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency led by Keith Alexander blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, first you need to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers are starting to take action in response to the U.S. spying scandal.
The Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday approved a bill that imposes additional restrictions on the activities of the U.S. Department of electronic intelligence.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all spheres and areas.
This was stated by Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei at a press conference following a meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, BelTA correspondent reports.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in the development and deepening of Belarusian-Turkish relations in all spheres and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, so we agreed that the state administration bodies of the two countries will provide universal assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts between them," Vladimir Makei said.
He stressed that the Belarusian government will create all the necessary conditions for this and provide maximum assistance.
The minister also said that the regular 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish joint intergovernmental economic commission was held in Ankara, according to the results of which a protocol was signed.
The parties have developed a roadmap for Belarusian-Turkish cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian Foreign Ministry, is aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade, economic and investment fields, in the spheres of industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, as well as searching for new forms and directions of cooperation.
"The protocol of the last meeting has been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey consider each other as reliable partners," he said.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said that at the talks, the foreign ministers of the two countries decided to further develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
Trade between Belarus and Turkey, according to the Minister, it is necessary to increase and bring it to the figure of $ 1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in the field of investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, since there is untapped potential in this area, he believes.
The relations between our countries have always been very warm, and we hope that in the future they will be further strengthened and expanded.
And all the necessary conditions will be created for trade and economic relations and for the successful work of Turkish companies on the territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey," Davutoglu said.
Obama Refuses to Talk About Health Care
Amid the storm of criticism, President Obama yesterday backfired on his often-repeated, unequivocal promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.”
Seeing that hundreds of thousands of people are being notified by their service providers, Republicans in recent days have criticized the president for misleading American society.
Yesterday, Obama slightly tweaked his initial public promise.
“Most people who have health insurance that works can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Referring to what he called a “news revival” over the shutdown, Obama urged Americans receiving the notifications to look for other options in the market.
Most people will be able to get better, comprehensive health insurance plans for the same price or even cheaper than predicted.
“You will get more favorable conditions,” he said.
The administration said it should not surprise anyone that 5% of the population who buy insurance on their own may be forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me say directly to these Americans: You deserve better,” Sibelius said in a speech to the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the e-commerce site has been “horrifyingly bad” since October.
“I’m just as upset and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I want to regain your trust.”
Annoyed, Sibelius dropped the phrase, which was caught on the microphone behind her by an aide at yesterday’s House hearings after a heated debate with Rep. Billy Long, a Missouri Republican, about whether she should be required to join Obama’s health care program herself.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long once again urged Sibelius to say why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily waived government-sponsored insurance to acquire the plan through HealthCare.gov, which she is now imposing on millions of Americans.
Agency "Rosbalt" deprived of the status of the media for obscene language
On October 31, the Moscow City Court decided to invalidate the license to register the agency "Rosbalt", - writes "Lenta".
Roskomnadzor insisted on depriving the agency of its media status for systematic and gross violations of the law on the media.
In the course of the trial, an unpleasant precedent was created: the court considered it possible to close the media, effectively denying the publication the right to put forward counter-arguments.
What is "Rosbalt"
CJSC Rosbalt Information Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional divisions.
The agency also has representative offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and functioned as a federal information and analytical agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was on the list of the most recognizable private Internet media in Russia.
At the same time, Rosbalt has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the agency’s exclusive publications were (and still are) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Talks about the closeness of the publication to the power structures continued throughout the existence of the agency.
In addition to the fact that Rosbalt had an extensive database of sources in various departments, in favor of such assumptions said that the project was headed by Natalia Chaplina - the wife of Viktor Cherkesov.
At the same time, Chaplina’s role in the leadership of Rosbalt is not completely clear: she is most often called the “project manager”.
The general director of the agency is Larisa Afonina, the editor-in-chief is Nikolay Ulyanov.
Recently, Rosbalt did not appear in the ratings of the federal media - neither by citation nor by audience.
In October, the agency took the 25th place in the rating of visits to Russian media sites according to LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the site rosbalt.ru is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials for the past five months are notes about the Kremlin’s helplessness in relations with Ukraine, the death of the soloist of the group “King and Jester”, pogroms in the capital Biryulev.
The conflict between Rosbalt and Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the law on the media came into force, prohibiting journalists from obscene language.
The agency found banned vocabulary in two videos published on the agency's website ("Jigit from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot desecrated the oil rigs").
Further sides are described differently.
Roskomnadzor, on the basis of the discovered video materials, accused Rosbalt of gross and systematic violation of the law on the media and appealed to the court with a request to withdraw the license from the agency.
In "Rosbalt" stated that the claims of the Agency are illegal: firstly, the videos were not editorial materials, secondly, the native words in them were disguised, and, thirdly, immediately after the warning, the videos were removed from the site.
Representatives of the agency appealed Roskomnadzor’s claims in the justice of the peace – and when the Moscow City Court accepted Roskomnadzor’s claim on October 22, 2013, the consideration of these complaints was still ongoing.
However, on the 25th, the justice of the peace made a decision not in favor of Rosbalt: editor-in-chief Nikolai Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the code of administrative offenses and fined 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each video.
Obviously, this predetermined the outcome of the hearing in the Moscow City Court - if we abandon the idea that the outcome could have been predetermined even earlier.
On October 31, the court decided to invalidate the Rosbalt registration certificate, effectively depriving the agency of its media status.
It cannot be said that Rosbalt remained alone during this confrontation.
The Agency was supported by the deputies of the State Duma (the statement to the head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov on October 10 was signed by 26 deputies; the document itself was submitted at the initiative of the Communist Party).
The head of the Union of Journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, the chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists Pavel Gusev and the head of the presidential Human Rights Council Mikhail Fedotov said about the illegality of the closure of the publication.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the leadership of Roskomnadzor even provided him with some guarantees that the case will not come to the revocation of the license.
The trial of Rosbalt has shown that it is safer for the media in Russia to be under whose jurisdiction today – a big question.
Syria Destroys Chemical Weapons Equipment
Syria has destroyed all declared facilities for the production of chemical weapons, recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament was completed by Damascus one day ahead of schedule.
Before November 1, Syria had to destroy production and other auxiliary facilities designed to prepare military toxic substances for use, the BBC reports.
The destruction of the stockpiles of toxic substances or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of the OPCW, currently poisonous substances are in sealed storage facilities.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21, according to the United States.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition.
These production facilities will now be closely monitored to prevent them from being repaired.
The next milestone is mid-November: by that time, the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan to destroy the already existing stockpiles of toxic substances.
There's a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by Western intelligence services.
They would be happy to advise inspectors of new facilities for verification if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus is not completely frank.
The US believes that this shelling was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of the Syrian rebels.
The world community demanded from the Syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached with the mediation of Russia, to destroy or put into an inactive state all the capacities for the production of shells, poisonous gases and liquids and to fill the shells with these substances.
Now that this stage has passed, the next step should be to destroy the chemical weapons already available to the Syrian army.
It is assumed that in this arsenal there may be more than 1000 tons of nerve agents, cutaneous mustard gas and other prohibited chemicals stored in several dozen different places.
In order to destroy it, it is necessary that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities first agree on a timetable for action, which takes two weeks.
The head of OPCW field operations, Jerry Smith, told the BBC that his inspectors had "personally observed the destruction of equipment".
“They now have no possibility of further production or mixing of chemical weapons,” he said.
The OPCW said in a statement that inspectors had visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and were convinced that the factories producing shells and poisonous substances had either been destroyed or rendered unusable.
The remaining two sites are too dangerous to inspect, the document says, but the equipment was transported from there and checked by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the infrastructure for the production of chemical weapons was “particularly difficult”, as it had to work in the context of the ongoing conflict.
The OPCW won the Nobel Peace Prize in early October, but Smith said it was not yet time for inspectors to celebrate because they were too busy working.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented admission that U.S. espionage "has gone too far"
John Kerry has demonstrated a softening of U.S. surveillance tactics, making an unprecedented admission that in some cases U.S. espionage “has gone too far.”
The Secretary of State also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being “on autopilot” at the time of Edward Snowden’s high-profile revelations about NSA spying.
These leaks have put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking via video link at an open government conference in London, Mr Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the president and I, as well as other members of the government, have actually taken some of the things that are happening on autopilot, because that possibility already existed – both during World War II and during the very difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, 9/11.”
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had gone too far, but stressed that no one’s rights had been violated.
He said: “In some cases it has gone too far.
And the president is determined to shed light on this issue and explain himself to the people, and is now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has a sense of abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was acting out of good faith and that his surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We are working in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, blow people up and attack governments.
And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented plane crashes, building explosions and killing people because we were able to learn about these plans in advance.”
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will head to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged U.S. spying abroad and convince Europeans to continue joint counterterrorism measures with the U.S., the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he spoke with members of the European Parliament and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations because of frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
“It is really important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain our supporters in our common anti-terrorism efforts,” Democrat Murphy, who serves as the first term and chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.
“And I’m going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger at these NSA programs.”
The news that the NSA has collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some U.S. allies, though the agency chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata NATO allies were collecting and sharing with the U.S.
Other revelations cited documents released by Snowden that showed the NSA was monitoring German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone, as well as the phones of some 34 other world leaders.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended spying on allies as necessary and said it was commonplace on both sides.
Amid the uproar, Murphy said his office was organizing a congressional trip expected to take place this year and that he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of the other participating lawmakers are due to be announced in the coming days.
According to him, the program of the trip is still at the stage of development.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of the trip was to promote better relations, he said that some degree of “brutality from the best motives” would also be manifested.
He said European leaders should be honest with their people about what spying programs they themselves have used over the years.
“While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones engaged in intelligence activities,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is due to head to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to address issues of hostility toward U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. intelligence activities.
In the new composition of public supervisory commissions will increase the influence of prison officers
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve new composition of public observation commissions (ONC) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the option put to the vote is adopted, the lobbyists of the security forces will increase their influence.
ONCs are social structures that control the conditions of detention in places of deprivation of liberty.
The cases of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozjaev, the unrest in the colony of Cope - it is through the ONC that most resonant incidents behind bars are publicized.
There is a struggle for control of the ONC between human rights defenders and lobbyists of the security forces.
At the meeting of the OP working group on the formation of the ONC, I proposed to make the selection criterion the experience of human rights activities.
"He was not accepted, and formed lists, without developing criteria," - says Valery Borshchev.
Borschev is the current chairman of the Moscow monitoring commission and the Association of Independent Observers, an all-Russian structure of human rights defenders dealing with prison issues.
As a State Duma deputy from Yabloko, he developed a law regulating the activities of the ONC.
The OP Council must vote for the composition of the ONC in 43 regions of the country.
Fewer than a thousand people apply for 1,800 vacancies, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria, competitions could not be organized due to the lack of candidates.
OP promises to organize a pre-selection for vacant seats.
The Moscow ONC is one of the few commissions with a competition, despite the fact that the new composition will have 40 participants instead of 20.
According to Borshchev, in the current composition of the Metropolitan Commission, 11 human rights defenders and 9 security forces, and in the version that is voted on in the OP, the ratio changes by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to get to the capital commission.
But a representative of the "Fighting Brotherhood" Vyacheslav Kalinin can re-enter the new composition.
He was a member of the ONC for three years, but never visited the prisoners.
Borschev believes that the security forces, having appointed their chairman of the ONC, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders intolerable, so human rights defenders do not exclude a collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their opinion, the promotion of security forces is coordinated by the member of the ONC Anton Tsvetkov, who heads the "Officers of Russia" - an organization that defends the interests of law enforcement agencies.
"I do not eat babies on the back of the truck," Anton Tsvetkov told RBC daily.
He denies lobbying for the promotion of any lists and says he has no intention of preventing human rights defenders from visiting arrested opposition figures.
According to Tsvetkov, he was not even interested in what list is now voted in the OP.
He considers the publication of Borschev’s information a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change of leadership of the Chelyabinsk ONC.
Its former leaders will be removed due to last year's kopeck riots.
In the Public Chamber came to the conclusion that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of prisoners.
But the ONC Rostov-on-Don can move from human rights defenders to security forces.
The human rights chairman of the local commission disappeared from the new lists, but turned out to be one of his opponents, despite the fact that in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber expelled him for unethical behavior.
Borschev considers the lists of the Moscow and Rostov commissions “a revenge for Kopeysk”.
The revelations of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova did not affect the ONC of Mordovia, which is considered a “force”: only one human rights activist wanted to get into the new composition, and she did not even accept documents for the competition.
OP Council member Nikolai Svanidze told RBC daily that he voted against the proposed list, as he is outraged by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He sent his position to other members of the council.
His colleague on OP Pavel Gusev says that he voted for, because he likes the proposed Moscow list.
The compilation of the lists of the ONC was coordinated by the Deputy Secretary of the OP Vladislav Grib, who is also an employee of the Research Institute of the Federal Penitentiary Service.
Grib told RBC daily that he does not consider it right to divide candidates into human rights defenders and security forces and does not agree that the chairmen of the commissions have enough powers to interfere with the work of its members.
The Mushroom does not undertake to predict the results of the vote of the OP Council.
If the proposed list is rejected today, an amended version will be put to the vote in the coming days.
Australian Woman Appeals Against Thai Prison Sentence
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island for falsely claiming she was attacked by a taxi driver, appealed the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty on June 15 by a Phuket provincial court of filing a false claim after Thai police reported that a local taxi driver carried out the attack on the night of Sunday, June 10, while two other men were holding her.
However, CCTV footage later revealed that she had safely returned to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before she admitted to fabricating the story.
Before the trial, she was held in local police cells.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison term at a general-regime detention center on the outskirts of Phuket, not an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tanks, who turned to the Foreign Office in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and was waiting for her return to Australia.
“Obviously it was an unsettling time, but we hope she gets home safely as soon as possible,” Tanks said.
Bamford appealed her conviction and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently spending her vacation in the resort area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand said Bamford is currently representing a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to a court extending her sentence to up to two years and forcing her to serve time in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore its undermined tourist image, which will lead to an acquittal.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris at the presentation of his novel "Eltysheva", translated into French.
It was this novel that became the finalist of four awards: “Clear Glade”, “Russian Booker”, “National bestseller” and “Big Book”.
And last year the writer for this book was awarded the prize of the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is the undisputed leader in the generation of current thirty-year-old and forty-year-old prose writers.
Almost every publication of his hard, built on modern life stories and stories causes a heated debate among critics of a variety of directions.
It can be argued that the collected articles on the prose and journalism of Senchin, reviews of his books and magazine publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the early 2010s.
In discussions about the works of “one of the most controversial contemporary writers”, according to the critic Sergei Chuprinin, the talk is mostly about what its participants understand by the word “literature” as they see the present and future not only of our literature, but also of life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow to include most of the articles and reviews from the regional media and the blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are given, as a rule, in abbreviations in the sections "Paragraphs ..."
