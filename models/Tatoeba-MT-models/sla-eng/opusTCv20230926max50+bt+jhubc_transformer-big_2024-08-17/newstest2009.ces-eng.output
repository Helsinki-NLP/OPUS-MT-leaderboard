The Prague Stock Exchange fell to a minus at the end of trading
After the morning sharp fall, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected the losses.
Transactions with CEZ shares reached almost half of the daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued its decline on Monday from the beginning of trading on Tuesday, when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, the decline is caused by the fall of shares on Wall Street.
In our country, too, the market’s reaction to the result of the US House of Representatives vote, which refused to support the stabilization plan for the financial sector there.
Falling Stocks in Asia
Stocks in Asia experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indexes eventually wiped out some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange's Hang Seng Index wrote down nearly four percent in the course of trading, but later erased some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, while markets in Shanghai were closed.
Stocks in Sydney lost more than five percent, but ultimately fell to 4.3 percent.
Taiwan’s stock market, according to the index, fell by 3.6%.
“The timing of the U.S. bailout is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Hong Kong, although part of China, sets its monetary policy independently, that is, without dependence on the Chinese central bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US lawmakers should quickly return to negotiations and approve the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries are likely to feel the effects.
The Bloodbath of American Stocks
The US House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which was to be spent up to $ 700 billion (almost CZK 12 trillion).
Lawmakers ignored President George W. Bush’s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and major stock indices saw their biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by nearly seven percent and fell to a similar extent last in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal did not pass in the House, the index was in free fall.
Congress backs down: US government could pump $700 billion into banks
The top representatives of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of financial assistance agreement for the US financial system.
It will be voted on early next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in talks to approve a $700 billion bailout for the U.S. financial system.
However, it has not yet been won.
Congressmen must complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final version of the bill and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed at the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, told Reuters.
The Senate is expected to vote on the plan on Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be approved should be the first significant psychological factor in the recovery of financial markets.
After that, however, there will be a "sobriety" due to the complexity of the mechanisms by which to help the markets to achieve even in practice.
Paulson: Plan must be effective
“We have made great progress.
We have resolved our differences of opinion on what the market stabilisation package should look like," said Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat.
He said the final vote could take place on Sunday.
Lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to finalize the government fund.
He should buy unsold mortgage assets from financial companies, which drag financial firms into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the verge of a final agreement on a plan that will work and must be effective on the market.
We still need to continue the recovery plan, but I think we are there,” Paulson said.
Signal for Asian Trading
The global financial crisis is having a major impact on stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors about trading on Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone where a congressional decision could affect Monday’s trading.
However, it is not yet clear when the two chambers of the US Congress will vote on the law, nor whether negotiations at the last minute can be tied to any problem.
Legislators hope it will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the scheme is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be available as soon as possible, as President George W. Bush has demanded.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, followed by another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush praised progress in the talks.
The president can veto the decision, but Congress can override the veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was to raise funds to buy back bad mortgage securities, whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgages, remained.
"We worked out everything.
“The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday,” Gregg said.
U.S. President George W. Bush is also pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with Saturday's progress and appreciated "the two-party effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restrictions on Gold Parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the lead negotiator, said lawmakers had agreed on responsibilities for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing relief, timing funding the plan.
The new law also aims to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the program and sets up a committee to oversee the fund.
It should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard on this, and we’ve made great progress toward an agreement that works and is useful for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also counts on help for homeowners who are having trouble repaying.
The government should negotiate new installments for the mortgages it buys in order to reduce the monthly cost of installments for borrowers and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Marko, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"This is because it is not known by what mechanism and at what price the problem assets will be redeemed.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government share their losses," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now or early next week, according to Mark, is not that important.
“It is far more important that this week the congressmen agree that they support this plan and that they will consecrate it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on the approval is the most important at the moment," Marek stressed.
Fight on the edge of the knife: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
It is better to just buy a phone.
Still, there are plenty of reasons for a person to purchase a separate player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It’s probably hard to get a top-notch expensive turntable at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
On the one hand, such music products do not come out on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason for this.
However, if there are vinyls with art rock, jazz or blues in your shelves, you probably dream of such a turntable at least.
It is the same with music on the go, i.e. music compressed, in simple terms - music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories.
For some, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan may find it difficult to try on headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It also determines the battery life
Some high-end music players can handle much more than just playing music, but what most mobile phones do by no means.
No other device is as versatile as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, telephony and texting, he can play music and video, record both, has a better, worse camera and can even navigate.
And when we take into account smartphones and communicators, you will also have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a small miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV can take pictures.
The universality of the mobile also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your mobile, the sooner the indicator on the display sends you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few phones can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, usually much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
In the case of cheap mobile phones, you should expect that they will not play for more than a few hours.
If you still call here and there, get another charger to work for sure - this also applies to more expensive devices.
MP3 players will not have this problem, even the worst ones will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
Another problem arises when recording music to a mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector, and moreover, not every one of them can be directly connected to the computer without special software.
Of course, it is possible to record music directly to a memory card, but few card readers can cope without reduction with the miniature memory cards that are used in mobile phones.
With the exception of iPods, you don’t need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and players will already create their own music library sorted by the name of the artist, album title, genre or user rating.
Some devices display only the tree structure of directories similar to Windows Explorer, and some are able to do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with an operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobiles are more capable
When choosing a specific device, be especially interested in battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of audio output and, of course, the comfort of control.
If your music is primarily a backdrop and you listen to it every day for a short time, for example in a tram, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 will be enough for you.
Almost any mobile phone can do that.
You don’t even have to watch what music formats your phone or player can do.
MP3 can handle all and the vast majority of the music that gets to you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widely used and in addition to it, the vast majority of devices can also handle music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
Simply visit the relevant website of the operator (or other provider) and purchase the song or album via the mobile internet.
This service in itself could be a strong argument for the purchase of a music mobile phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is poor and is usually limited only to quick-fermented radio hits.
The prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether via GSM, the Internet or wireless Internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people carry their cell phones with them all the time.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you can feel the phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
However, it also depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least wired handsfree with you.
If not, you can use the integrated speaker, which has almost every mobile, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of music phones will be the price for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost under three thousand.
For three and four thousand crowns you will already get a very decent walkman.
Most of the time, however, you will be limited by the absence of an output to normal headphones.
The best and most technically equipped phones even with a 3.5 mm jack for ordinary headphones cost up to fifteen thousand.
The advantage of the players is, among other things, easy operation.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can control really everyone.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of the control with a previously common cassette player or perhaps a turntable is obvious.
There is no risk of a collision in the form of an accidentally switched on mobile Internet and subsequently a giant account for data transmission.
Which device to use
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for removable memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the corresponding card, you will fit into two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
For basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive ones can cope with 8 GB of memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creativa, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to spend more than CZK 1,100.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, rather reach for specialized mobiles - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokias and Samsungs).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and thus the comfort of the operator is close to a separate MP3 player.
The furthest is Sony Ericsson, whose walkman phones have the same user interface as separately sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to a maximum of 35 hours), will take MP3 players away from the above brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Yet something is missing here - a virtual operator that would make the classics cheaper.
Maybe he won't be long.
We have written many times about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
Moreover, this was also confirmed by the CTU, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
Following the latest steps of the European Commission in the field of roaming charges regulation, a paradoxical situation may arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to fight.
It may sound paradoxical, because we have three mobile networks and penetration is well over 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to boast that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunication Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), often echoes them in this, who has said several times in the past that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that the classic operator with its own network probably does not have much chance (after all, it would probably be difficult to search for frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought a significant reduction in prices, to which then even classic operators had to react.
However, even before the entry of the strikers such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the market, similar voices were heard in the UK as in our country.
But it turned out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
We don’t have to go too far for examples.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, the operator has managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
At the same time, behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which in the Czech Republic owns, among other things, U:fona.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to operate effectively, they need much fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They do not incur relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators are usually profiled as low-cost - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often balanced by a narrower range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on a fresh target group can also be quite a good move.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
“The right guys choose Mobilking – an operator they like and can trust,” says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which operates the virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could be found in our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segment approach on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated in terms of service offerings."
In the Czech Republic without a chance, say mobile operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very promising.
Rather, Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, a spokeswoman for the Penta financial group, told Mobil.cz in a telephone interview.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything so that no potential competitor arises.
The GTS Novera Group has been interested in launching a virtual mobile operator for a long time, which would like to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress with some of them," said Pavel Kaidl, a spokesman for the group.
Maybe he's looking forward to better times.
From unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual operator should be expected by the end of the year.
For now, however, its creation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, we have not been approached by any entity with a comprehensive and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> from the press department of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 told Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokesman Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the O2 statement: "We have not yet seen any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which to build further."
“It’s hard to have a virtual operator on T-Mobile by the end of the year.
At this point, we would have to have a concrete agreement on the table to be able to think in this short term.”
Vodafone is focusing its attention on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> says: "We are open to dealing with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider to be the most beneficial from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The procedure of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a decrease in prices and thus to a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor?
The fact that when operators are interested in something, they are able to pull by one rope, is also evidenced by the tugs around the formation of U:fon.
Probably the greatest pressure towards CTU was at the time of the creation of U:fon by T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the CTU website.
Now, however, U:fon is useful as an argument for not allowing a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová said: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been enhanced by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would place high demands on him and, above all, on his services."
However, given this approach of mobile operators, the complete lack of interest of the Czech regulatory authorities is striking.
It is not just the position of CTU, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike the UK and other developed countries - does not have the power to interfere with competition.
These belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
But he took his typical approach to the whole issue.
“The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of a contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator for the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, since the offer of potential candidates was probably not interesting enough for classical operators," Kristián Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the Office of the OOHS said in response to our question.
From the representatives of operators, such a statement is probably not surprising.
From the authority that is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses their position in the market, this is more than respectable.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Outside where virtual operators normally operate, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile phone services."
Apparently, however, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and the drop in prices are not among the interests of the Office.
In fact, shocking on the whole case is the touching convergence of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is offered entirely by itself.
Just like the exact same price of petrol at gas stations, it is certainly only a matter of chance and a fierce competitive struggle.
"The Office has found no evidence of anti-competitive conduct in this case and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore does not have adequate increased responsibility for its conduct on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market to virtual operators are likely to be lacking for the telecommunication regulator as well," Chalupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of relevant markets prepared by CTU, according to which telecommunications are the only market in terms of competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - to create a virtual operator, you always need the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator - quite logically - has a monopoly on its network.
So in a certain segment it must necessarily be dominant.
Even if we do not accept this argument, it should be at least a warning to the Office of the OOHS that the three mobile operators are acting in a conspicuously similar way.
At the same time, complaints from a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles when dealing with all operators.
The imposition of liability on CTU is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications, which the Office gives away from the whole matter.
We have met him on several similar occasions.
Unfortunately, until the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act, the extension of the CTU’s powers to the area of competition in telecommunications failed to assert itself, although many experts promised to improve the situation.
This must be known by the representatives of the OOHS more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
It's okay when no one's looking
At the same time, the functioning of some pseudo-virtual operators remains unnoticed, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that issue their own price lists of mobile phone services, but they are only partially public.
These are usually multi-level marketing companies.
Its own mobile phone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The prices of these companies usually reach only the chosen ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts as a classic company customer towards the operator, who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a significant customer, he will then receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar resale.
"If there are cases you are talking about, it could be a violation of the terms and conditions that we would deal with and could result in termination of cooperation with the company," Martina Kemrová answered our question on this issue.
However, it is quite unlikely that such an activity would not be carried out by responsible people from mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three mentioned companies, there may be thousands of customers.
However, none of the operators will be able to prevent such a procedure.
They have considerable profits from the activities of these companies and, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> points out possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card in their phone is not in their name, so they cannot have it fully as regular customers of mobile operators.
That should be the least strange thing.
In addition, another question opens up for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to a similar procedure, why block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the Office has relatively strong powers to detect such activities, and if it does not want to, it may not be satisfied with the explanation of the operators that they have no idea about anything like this and their business conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be the most expensive
As it has already happened several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a noticeable decrease in prices for services.
In virtually all countries where virtual operators originated, classical operators tried to more or less prevent their creation.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - too small or over-saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, it was at this point that regulators intervened, defending not the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Whether by formal measures or informal pressure, they then achieved the creation of the first virtual operator and more were stacked on it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are shifting the whole case like a hot potato.
We cannot get rid of the impression from our experience that ambiguities in competences are more than useful to them in these cases.
But let's not throw flint in the rye.
If the behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator is really coming soon, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If one of the operators admitted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the OOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And maybe we'll stop calling more than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech national anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to four versions of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov moj on the occasion of the Day of Czech Statehood.
The anthem was newly recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
There are four versions - with male or female solo singing, in choral performance and instrumental version.
The singing was performed by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the adaptations of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiá<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
You can listen to all four versions on iHNed.cz.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
He has previously told Czech Radio that he deliberately chose singers with young representative voices who are prominent and popular to sing solo versions.
“From the beginning, I tried to make sure that both of them, and then also the choir, had a clear diction, that the text was well understood, that they were in agreement,” he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov moj was first performed in 1834 on the boards of the Estates Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously took it for their own.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first verse of the song became a natural part of the national anthem.
One of the seven national symbols remained even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
What is the “new” anthem?
Prague’s public transport will be on the chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday 1st October 2008 will go down in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers will enter the metro, trams and buses, who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
At the moment, it can be purchased by about one hundred thousand people who own an Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual coupon (this will apply from January 1, 2009) and have it uploaded to their smart card in the information centers and workplaces of the Transport Company in the metro stations Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly, Let<0xC5><0x88>any, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Ka<0xC4><0x8D>erov and Luka.
Coupons can also be purchased online from yesterday on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than 400 customers in the afternoon.
Those who start using the online store can finally forget about the dispensing windows in metro stations, where they have had to regularly stand in long queues on paper tickets.
They buy the coupon online and upload it to the Opencard card in one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
"At these places, passengers have a counter with trained staff, which will help those interested with online shopping and also upload the purchased coupon to their card," said Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>, a spokesman for the project.
In addition to libraries, it will be possible to upload electronic coupons to Opencard also in self-service vending machines, which are mounted in several subway vestibules.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket markers and passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are five of them in the city now, but there should be eighty by the end of the year," he added.
Coupon will check the place of the driver automat
Operating the machines, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Just insert the Opencard chip card into them and the previously paid coupon will be loaded on it itself.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow apply not only in the capital, but also in its vicinity.
That is, in suburban trains and bus lines with the number 300 to 499, which go to the capital mainly residents of the Central Bohemian municipalities.
"In the trains included in the Prague Integrated Transport, the conductors are equipped with card readers, with which they check the time and zone validity of coupons," explained Filip Drápal from the Ropid organization, which compiles timetables for Prague public transport.
Suburban buses have card readers built into the cash register at the driver.
Upon boarding, it is therefore necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but also to attach the Opencard to the designated place on the side of the cash register.
This will allow the driver to check the validity of the vouchers.
“If a passenger needs to verify the validity of a ticket, there’s nothing easier than asking the driver for this information,” Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take suburban buses and do not remember when their coupon expires can go back to self-service vending machines, where coupons are uploaded to the card.
Here, information about the validity of their documents is displayed on the display of the device.
Sudetenland wants a referendum on the US
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans asked for the inclusion of <0xC5><0xA0>umava in the United States.
It flows from the letter, which is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the President of the United States with such a wish.
This follows, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans from <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov, in a letter to the US President, ask him not to allow the return of the "<0xC5><0xA0>umava <0xC5><0xBE>upa" - taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we want to be really sure in our words that American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter, signed "People who care about the fate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava," reads.
Since the annexation to Czechoslovakia supposedly gives the Sudeten Germans - with the knowledge of the Czech national nature - hope only for brutality, ruthlessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter of the American president ask that he take over the protectorate over <0xC5><0xA0>umava for the present and eternal times.
“We cannot believe that regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would admit this territory to a foreign state that oppresses and disproves minorities and nothing at all contributed to the victory of the Allies,” the letter said.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of the vindictiveness of the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States were to doubt the views of the Germans in <0xC5><0xA0>umava, it would be enough for him to hold a referendum in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava County on whether its inhabitants want to become part of the United States or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a bit naive in today’s knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses, it adequately illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Although the Czech Germans must have had at least an inkling that this would be their expulsion from the republic, few of them even allowed such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
He was during the war as a Budweiser German deployed to the Baltic Navy.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, Czech would be useful to them," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners living before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, did not expect to be expelled from the Republic on the basis of Bene<0xC5><0xA1>’s decrees.
You don't - you'll pay!
An emotional campaign will attack the driver
The most expensive road safety event in Czech history.
Even so, one could characterize the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek promises to discourage the driver from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The $150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, and on flyers.
It should discourage the driver from driving fast and drinking behind the wheel.
And remind them to buckle up before they go out.
He wants to reach out to young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And this is evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't - you'll pay!
The word "do not think" is written in capital letters on the essay.
And then there's the word "pay" in the pool of blood.
This is to symbolize that a person can pay for a moment of inattention with his own life.
Spectators will be "scared" of the spots until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can usually see pictures with drastic images of victims of accidents.
It promises to reduce the accident rate and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip on the driver
"The driver is subject to the sugar and whip system.
Sugar for them is that when they go for red, for example, it saves time.
A whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says Na Homolce hospital traffic psychologist Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án.
That is why information campaigns in the press are needed, and especially negative advertising, according to the psychologist.
In his opinion, boards that alert the driver to the danger are already less effective.
"If a static warning board is installed, it will probably merge with the environment soon and drivers will not pay attention to it," Ko<0xC5><0x99>án said.
Olmert would return almost all of the occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has called for the return of virtually all of the territories occupied in 1967, including Pre-Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published on Monday by the daily Yediot Achronot.
“We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we will have to return almost all, if not all, of the occupied territories,” Olmert said.
“We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage [of Israel’s territory] because without that there will be no peace,” he said.
He also said that East Jerusalem would be included in the return.
“Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and especially doesn’t want tractors or bulldozers running over their feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem,” Olmert said in a reference to two July attacks in the city that left several people dead and dozens injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, sacred and historical places", which lies inside the Old Town.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work,” he further stressed.
Departure from the Golan Heights
Olmert also called for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, an essential condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But it would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
“I do not propose to make peace with Syria only on the basis of leaving the Golan,” he said.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up in order to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with (the Shia movement) Hezbollah; they will have to give up the continued support they provide to Hamas’ terrorism, Al Qaeda’s (the terrorist network) and jihad (holy war) in Iraq.”
Questions after the accident: Are flight attendants on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, walking on a long-distance bus is not allowed
In connection with the tragic accident of a Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arose as to whether flight attendants and passengers could move around the bus while driving.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the steward's activity is contrary to the law on road traffic," said Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, which killed a 22-year-old stewardess last week, was apparently caused by a truck driver crossing the road.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, although she had two more seats.
However, the bus can crash or brake sharply, even when the steward is delivering coffee or newspapers.
The role is played by whether the bus is equipped with parking spaces according to the technical certificate.
If the bus is not homologated, the passenger must sit.
The Student Agency long-distance buses have no standing space; the director of Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura confirmed this.
"We dealt with this with the Ministry and at first did not allow the movement of passengers.
“They then called it off and we’ve come to the point where passengers are allowed to go to the toilet when they have their seat,” he said.
The steward's law is unknown.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward - no legislation addresses this role.
However, no legislation prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of the driver of the vehicle; it does not define its rights and obligations," Hanzelka added.
On the other hand, Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, the director of the traffic department of the Ministry of Transport, believes that the law treats the issue sufficiently.
"It depends on whether the bus has a standing position in the homologation.
That’s the end of it,” he says.
Buses are divided into urban buses with parking spaces and limited maximum speed, interurban buses with parking spaces with higher permitted speed and long-distance buses without parking spaces with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on a plane, an expert says.
BESIP traffic safety expert Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n does not see a major problem in the movement of flight attendants on board the bus.
"There are not many dangers when driving smoothly, the situation can be compared to servicing aircraft.
There’s no telling when the turbulence will come and the stewardess may hit her head.”
"But if the bus brakes sharply, of course, the laws of physics apply.
As in the city bus or tram.
The safety of flight attendants must be addressed by the carrier's internal regulations," he says and also believes that, from the point of view of the law, the issue is unresolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to cancel the service
Student Agency offers flight attendant services as the only bus carrier.
He employs two hundred of them.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their profession to be risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the flight attendants' profession is risky, I'll cancel it.
Coffee and newspapers are available upon arrival.
It would also save costs,” he said.
As an interest in safety, the absence of flight attendants in his cars was justified by the director of Asiana Alexey Litvin, who operates a fraction of the lines in comparison with SA.
"We don't have stewardesses, we've been against it since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in some fatal accident," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz less than a year ago.
There's been a huge tragedy
A young flight attendant from Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who worked for the company for two years, died in an accident on a line to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably veered off the line without using a direction indicator and blocked the way of the bus.
His driver tried to avoid him with a sharp maneuver, but hit him with the right front part.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura refuses to sell out two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards.
"These places cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company is going to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for a court order, but expects financial compensation from the culprit.
Amending the law?
I can't see
An amendment to the law on which a thirty-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year could provide clarification of the movement of flight attendants on board the bus.
"No concrete conclusion has been reached.
Buses do not solve much, but rather the point system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of a mobile phone while driving," says the expert Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of flight attendants as something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," Hanzelka concluded, adding that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and the labour safety authorities.
The hope of D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf is Frankfurt
Big words in the letter of the Board of Directors of WestLB are not lacking for the employees of this bank.
By combining the units of this D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf monetary institution with the Frankfurt-based Deka-Bank, the "central institution of the financial group of savings banks for trade in capital markets" will be created, we read in the letter, which was made public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will introduce a “set of competencies” into the transaction to ensure long-term revenues.
In general, it is said that such a connection can be a decisive impulse for further mergers in the regional banks sector.
Such texts are created when the board wants to demonstrate the ability to act in a problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Commission, but also on the part of the Federal Office for the Supervision of Financial Services, whose message to the Land Government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
However, the connection between Deka-Bank, which savings customers know for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever its type, has been talked about for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
Franz Waas, the head of Deka-Bank, said at the presentation of the half-year results of the management at the end of August that in the merger of his bank house from Mainzer Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e with one of the regional banks, such as Helaba Bank or WestLB, he did not see the point.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka-Bank, which consists of one half of the Landesbank and the other savings bank, has instructed the Board of Directors to conduct talks with WestLB on joint business activities.
It could be a capital market transaction or a part of it.
But the talks have only just begun, the financiers said.
This is not the first time that Deka-Bank, with its 3,000 employees, is one of the most important employers in the Frankfurt financial market, in connection with the consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a while that Deka-Bank could merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba Bank.
In the end, there was nothing of this trio.
Shortly after the merger plans were made public, the Hessian Land Government spoke out against the participation of Helaba Bank.
Neither of the other two banks were so close.
Instead, Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz acquired Landesbank Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg from Stuttgart.
Nevertheless, there have been repeated speculations about the connection of Deka-Bank with the regional banks.
Recently, however, G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba Bank, spoke negatively about the speculation about the merger of his financial house with others.
However, independently of this, it seems to be growing the conviction that the convergence of the various banking houses of the public sector is a necessity.
Now, after the elections to the Bundestag in Bavaria, the merger of BayernLB with Landesbank Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg could be the first.
That's not good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers should increase, it is gradually losing possible partners for such a merger.
In the south, only the second violin would play, despite the fact that they still face the financial crisis much better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year, the Hessen-Th<0xC3><0xBC>ringen Union of Savings and Credit Union Banks, which has a 58% stake in Helaba, banned the connection with WestLB.
This would be the case for Nord LB.
However, geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how closely the business models of individual institutions harmonize.
In June, Merl said that the decisive question of which business model should ensure the future competitiveness of the Landesbanks, the German Union of Savings and Credit Unions, has not yet been answered.
It could also end up with the dissolution of WestLB, which, of course, no one wants in this institution.
Therefore, the letter of the board of directors of the bank also says that it is trying to provide a "comprehensive solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect the individual components with Deka-Bank, time will show.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "weekend with Italy"
It's the first time for Elena, the third or fourth time for Luca.
But this time, Elena will be there as his girlfriend, and so everything will be different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a stronger bearded man, and two hundred tourists at Oktoberfest proves how deep the tones of his throat can give.
Elena slaps Luca first and then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova station, four buses will depart this evening at 23.45 with the designation "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected arrival at 6.30.
Three buses are mainly occupied by Italians, in one bus there are only Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing with their flag, they were already celebrating at night.
And out loud, says Marco Guarda, it's nothing for Italians.
Marc, who wears a long coat with a fur-lined lining and glasses with wide silver rings, owns the three buses.
He has been going to Oktoberfest with them for five years, only this year he organizes three expeditions.
At night there, during the day between the stands with beer, at 22.30 departure back.
Overnight stays would only mean unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including a welcome drink with Kaiser beer, cooked exactly according to the Bavarian law on beer purity, health insurance and a German-speaking guide - Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
The buses leave at night, after the highway in the direction of "Brennero".
Beer's not served, not yet.
The bus stops quickly, the passengers sleep.
They're doing well, they'll still need their powers.
It is being built in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where it takes another break on Highway 8 just outside Munich, as well as many other buses with an Italian license plate.
When Marco’s group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half past seven in the morning, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco makes his final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First of all, wear a yellow hat.
On the left is written "Oktoberfest", next to the Internet address of Marc's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, “When the door to the beer tent opens, run!” calls Marco into the morning air.
"Go!" Go and occupy the back of the tent.
"Not in advance, so as not to interfere, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, spread out over the space!"
Máz costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show the security guys we're being nice.
As soon as you leave your seats, they’re gone!”
Third: "Tonight at exactly half past eleven, be here again!" Do you understand?
And up on Wiesn, a space with beer tents.
Along the way, one member of the group hangs yellow hats as signs on trees, signs, and even on the election poster of a large Bavarian party.
We need to prepare for retreat.
As the "weekend with Italy" is known the second weekend of Oktoberfest.
There are no exact figures on the number of visitors; it is said that fifty thousand of those who set off on a journey through the Alps and burst into beer tents, ten percent of all visitors this weekend reportedly came from Italy.
The ranks of the Munich police will be reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which keeps national statistics, in which the Italians ahead of the British (about 60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical treatments occupy the first place.
Especially popular with Italians is the tent Hofbr<0xC3><0xA4>u.
Sleepless nights for lenders Hypo Real Estate
Last week, German Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is good that this politician used the word "relatively" and included in his claim the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared from crisis development.
Because it happened last weekend.
Dax, a financial house specializing in the financing of Hypo Real Estate (HRE), will receive a loan of several billion euros from a consortium of German banks to protect against turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan will go up to 35 billion euros.
The interest will have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only from the amount actually spent.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to a news report, the state financier has refinanced extremely short-term for long-term projects for which he lent money, which is no longer possible due to mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserve shrank by 95 % to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.37 million and its equity ratio dropped slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to last year, while income from the increased value of receivables and certain securities, as well as from the abolition of reserves for credit trading, fell by more than 70 percent to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 million.
Only because of the higher revenues from compensation for the subsequent settlement costs of the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and the interest reimbursement under the Tax Code and the brokering of business for the group companies was the 16 per cent decline on the revenue side still moderated.
The former state financier, after his privatization in 1990, burned himself on mortgages for entrepreneurs, which were then earmarked from the portfolio of services and further led by Aareal Bank.
Because there was too little money in classical state financing, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects of private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
The value of its subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate, must now be written off, and these write-offs will have a “fundamental material effect” on the calculation of the group’s profit and loss, as some have made vaguely audible.
The fact is, there will be no dividend.
By 2007, it had already been cut by two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been an important financier of state and infrastructure projects since the acquisition of Depf.
More strongly than other institutions, it depends on refinancing in the interbank market, because it has no customer deposits.
After the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the source of interbank loans practically dried up, because banks are guarding liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing for part of Depfa’s loan portfolio – around 50 billion euros a year.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financial needs are covered by this loan for the foreseeable future and the company is protected “from the influence of international money markets currently largely incapacitated functions”.
Other sources have made it clear that this money will ensure refinancing by the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, said that Hypo Real Estate Group will not have to take advantage of the money markets in the near future.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for the Supervision of Financial Services (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group in the market is now ensured.
This is what the shareholders and creditors of the bank are hoping for.
But given the dynamics and impenetrability of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely possible that the loan would not need to be completely exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the bank appeared to be facing insolvency late on Sunday afternoon, rescue, however tentative, could not appease the passions.
The share price fell by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, the bond rates held up well.
While preferred debt has practically not moved, secondary bond rates are losing more significantly.
This mainly concerns the bonds of the former subsidiary W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg Hypo and, logically, the bonds with a maturity after 2009.
The Hypo-Real-Estate bonds originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability should be understood, depending on the stability of the international financial system, after the significant aggravation of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself, which brought it into the company by the acquisition of Depf.
As long as issuing banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to count on the payment of securities within their maturity.
But there may also be something that almost no one dares to hope for now - the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports coming at the same time as this partial nationalisation, there is now a mere legitimate hope, probably bordering on certainty.
This is especially likely to prepare long-term creditors a series of sleepless nights, when they will decide whether to give up their commitments.
Short-term investors can use the threshold to at least create a transfer of losses from previous accounting periods to the exchange yields of later years for the purpose of future payment of capital gains tax.
Sylvana and the secret of the bento box
When sixteen-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is about to introduce herself on her first day of high school in Tachibana, the girls begin to giggle: The German girl is a kawaii!
What's that supposed to mean?
Sylvana knows this word already from manga. She talks about Japan on her new blog about the exchange stay.
"First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was already on my way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and ride a 40-minute train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way myself, fortunately I did not get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not given as strictly as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students begin to meet after eight o’clock and twenty minutes before nine o’clock begins a short session with the teacher, the so-called ‘home room’.
But before I started teaching, I should have introduced myself.
I’m not the type of person who likes to talk in front of people, let alone in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn’t have a school uniform yet, I wore my host mother’s old skirt, plus a blouse, blue knee-highs, and black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of the bench and tried to say everything correctly: 'Saj<0xC3><0xB3>nar Wo <0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that moment, I was very glad that I started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were whispering, giggling and waving, and I kept hearing the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly moved into my place.
The girl next to me smiled broadly, considering it an honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite calm, but when the gong came, I was literally showered.
They talked over each other and giggled and asked me about the possible and the impossible - and yet it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the break, they all unwrapped their bows.
My host mother also made me such a lunch box - and that's something other than boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber and algae salad, fruit and some fish in tofu batter.
I have no idea what I eat in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
The thing is, everything's really good.
Well, except for the salt-laden plums, br!
Benta in Japanese schools isn't just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that the girl gives the boy a hand-made bento, which in this case is especially artistically modified, and hopes that the boy will get to know more about the break during the snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I'll see it here, too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
And then I always said,
'Cause I'm just fascinated.'
I have loved reading manga for years.
And to better understand these comics and their culture, I started learning a little Japanese one day.
I knew I would have to come here one day.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And they are highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I’ve never felt lost here before, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Even rats have feelings.
When a rat or cockroach runs away from danger, does that mean that they too feel fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux believes that even animals have feelings.
But how could it be verified that they feel the same way when they behave like us?
In the online magazine "Edge" for several years, the contributions of well-known scientists have been published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without you being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it, when we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
But as soon as we begin to engage with another species and open up questions of perception or general consciousness, we enter into an impassable terrain, because the hardware does not match.
When a rat gets into danger, it does what many other animals do: it pretends to be dead, flees, or attacks.
Humans behave in a similar way, from which some scientists conclude a similar subjective experience.
I don't believe that, though.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
This is partly because the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its share of short-term memory and executive or control functions).
This vast area is much more developed in humans than in other primates, and appears to be completely absent in other creatures.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them knowledge of who we are and the ability to plan and make decisions, there is reason to believe that man is different even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could be hidden by the linguistic nature of man: because so much of his perception is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, we could exclude animals.
But even if consciousness did not matter about language, language would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, however constructed, would probably differ from most states of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to find out what consciousness looks like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it cannot be measured or, due to special hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, we are faced with great problems.
Most of my conclusions relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to study processes in the consciousness of animals regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in studies of short-term memory in primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But this approach, pursued by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses on neural correlates of consciousness rather than causal mechanisms: both may be identical, but they may not be.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the non-frontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What does this mean for feelings?
I deduce them from the fact that the emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in the brain conscious of its own activity.
What we refer to as “fear” is therefore the mental state we find ourselves in when the activity of a defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as bodily reactions) makes use of operational memory.
Seen from this angle, feelings are closely related to those areas of the cortex that are characterized by primates, and especially humans.
In connection with linguistic nature, a subtle gradualization of perception arises, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize states in order to attribute them to others next to ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in areas of the cortex and brain stem devoted to bodily sensations, similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could easily participate in the feelings perceived by multiple animal genera.
In theory, I can't argue with that, but I think it's inconclusive.
Pankseep argues that what appears to us as fear in rats and humans is likely to be felt by both organisms in the same way: But how can it be verified, Pankseep goes on to say, that rats and humans feel the same way when they behave in a similar way?
The cockroach flees from danger - does he also feel fear?
From my point of view, mere similarity of behavior cannot prove the conformity of experience.
It is true that the neural comparison moves us further: rats and humans have similar brain strains, on the contrary, cockroaches and the brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if it could be proven in humans, how would we want to prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how I'm supposed to prove it.
And since their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness rests on special circuits and on the tongue), I’d rather explore emotional behavior than the emotional perception of rats.
In any case, in this case, we can expect progress at the neural level, if we measure the same in rats and in humans.
Like rats, I don’t study language and consciousness, I don’t study feelings, because I don’t know if they exist.
It may be thought of as short-sighted, but I'd rather go forward than repeatedly throw myself against the wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: A grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that preparations will soon be led directly by the President and the Prime Minister.
“The government sees the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as a proof of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organize the European Championship together with Poland,” Vasjunyk said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has only just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries.”
In the early fulfillment of the time plan for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts limp.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for the ME will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as quickly as possible,” said Grigory Surkis, president of the Ukrainian Union.
"UEFA will be watching us all the time."
An even more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish PZPN was recalled by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miros<0xC5><0x82>aw Drzewiecki.
He said there was "a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that preparations for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer with this step."
Several teams from the first league were sentenced to a forced downfall last season due to manipulations, eventually even the start of the league had to be moved quickly.
Indignant Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to do an ad for a new movie, she spoke in an interview about private matters — and now she’s having trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan referred to her ex Dennis Quaid as a marriage wrecker.
He rages and strikes back.
Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid's delayed war of the roses: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors have an ugly argument - in front of the public.
In an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan for the first time commented on the reasons for the collapse of her marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
The extent of the fraud was not known until after the divorce.
The impetus for this mental striptease was Ryan's PR work for her new film "The Women" - which tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was stark: It’s “crazy,” the 45-year-old actor told the New York Daily News that “Meg repeatedly chews up the history of our relationship and adjusts it.”
In addition, it is “regrettable” that their 16-year-old son Jack is once again “publicly reminded of the pain and radical changes that divorce is for every child.”
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is married again and has recently become the father of twins.
He concludes his reflections on the bending by saying: “My life goes on anyway.
I’m lucky to have a wonderful family that’s doing great.”
Ticket and hotel prices are falling.
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to one recent study, flights were even cheaper by up to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel accommodation have once again become cheaper - this is the result of a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analyzed its data on reservations made in the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter, found a significant decrease in the second quarter.
After several years of rising prices in the hotel market, accommodation in many places has already become cheaper.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most noticeable in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
The reason for this trend is considered by American Express to be the weak dollar exchange rate, which has caused “the dwindling appetite of American tourists to travel”.
The fall in hotel prices also affected financial centres more than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices rose by 26.3 percent and even set a European record.
Ticket prices also showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
Because of the higher cost of kerosene, economy class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, the prices of Economy-class flights fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in Business and First-Class classes, the changes in cognition were less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, they grew by 11.9 percent, and fell by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
On German domestic flights, according to the cited study, prices fell by as much as half.
One of the reasons for this price drop is slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is increased competitive pressure due to the Open Skies agreement, which liberalized air traffic between the US and Europe.
A sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of unprofitable airlines by airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - there were 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV gets to the top of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to assemble a functioning eleven.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - enlarge Failed Landing for representative Marko Marina.
This player from Gladbach joined the game late and failed with a stick balloon.
His report was precisely worded, and it came out of his mouth convincingly.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," Hermann Rieger hissed in the corridor to the Hamburg Arena booths.
Not much was happening in the catacombs, the half-time break was over, and most of the people were back in their seats.
Rieger has been an HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades and enjoys more respect than many momentary actors.
And so his plea was also heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb at the match.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order was probably the same: here with the second goal!
There was no execution.
"Not everything's been pretty out here today," Marcell Jansen admitted later.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have wished for it to be more relaxed.
For 1:0 (1:0) Hamburgers owe the head of Mladen Petri<0xC4><0x87> (11th) and the circumstances that the very weak Gladba<0xC5><0xA1>ans could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
Hamburger SV will celebrate its 121st anniversary this Monday.
The audience celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and a live-updated table on the video wall, in which their team was listed as a winner.
It's gonna be a birthday without a proper party.
"We know how to evaluate it," Marcell Jansen said.
He suspects that the ongoing scoreboard symbolizes the league’s unaccountability rather than the dominance of his HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petri<0xC4><0x87> and FC Bayern's Jansen - is slowly located, but not yet able to shine.
"We need more feeling and more dribbling," Jol said emphatically.
After the defeat in the vote
There's fear on Wall Street.
The first reports of the rescue package sinking caused the Dow Jones index to drop by up to 700 points.
That was the biggest point loss in a single day in its history.
Later, Dow gained weight again.
At around 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock market barometer showed a five percent drop to 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was more than seven percent down at 1,548 points.
The worst was in Dow at this point, American Express, which lost nearly 14 percent, and Bank of America, with a loss of about 12 percent.
None of the titles have been strengthened.
Goldman Sachs has lost nearly 10% of its shares.
Just a few days ago, big investor Warren Buffett had a stake in this company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the entire amount is not paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the state is to receive stock option lists of financial companies, which, if the exchange rate develops favorably, could be reimbursed, thereby reducing the burden on the state budget.
Stock prices in Europe are falling sharply
Billion-dollar bailouts for banks in Europe and the U.S. leave investors in no doubt.
The rate of shares of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly downwards and pulls the Dax index with it.
The U.S. Dow Jones is losing despite the planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank pulled the index of German stocks (Dax) deep into the minus.
The Munich real estate financier’s shares lost up to three-quarters of their value despite the rescue by the federal government and private banks, while Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important 6,000-point mark and scored 5,839 points with a minus of 3.7 percent.
All over the world, the stock market has been on its knees.
In New York, the trading day on Wall Street began with significant losses.
Investors worry that the US government’s $700 billion bailout package may not be enough to revive financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points in its first hour of trading, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on the bailout, with the Senate expected to vote on it on Oct. 1.
Other European stock exchanges were moving in only one direction: in London, the FTSE index first fell by 3.2 percent, CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan’s leading Nikkei index fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 units after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng Index fell 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex index lost 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, and trading ended at 12,595.75.
In MDAX, after the announcement of the increase in the share capital of Arcandoru, they lost their shares.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed up 23 million new shares.
The business and tourism group also said it would not sell its stake in Thomas Cook.
Dark Matter Affects the Flight of Space Probes
For years, scientists have struggled with one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the Ulysses spacecraft has flown through space.
The fuel lines, which will soon be frozen, now threaten to die of cold.
For years, scientists have been puzzled by a mysterious phenomenon called the gravitational slingshot anomaly.
A gravitational slingshot is an aerial maneuver by space probes in which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a space body, such as the Earth.
Thanks to this, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
But what scientists have been saying for years in this case is astounding: flying objects don’t behave 100 percent as one would expect under the good old law of gravity.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly accelerating or slowing down.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
He was baptized by the gravity slingshot anomaly.
Several experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton continues to believe that Einstein was not mistaken, and is trying to explain the anomaly of the gravitational slingshot using the so-called dark matter, whose presence in the universe was discovered by astronomers.
"The dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space explorers for about a decade.
Obviously, the gravitational force is coming from it, the effect of which on other space bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, it is completely invisible, which means that it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, not even visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, from this dark matter is a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
In Egypt, kidnapped tourists are at large
After ten days in the hands of their captors, according to a statement by the Italian foreign minister in Egypt, the kidnapped tourists are again at large.
The hijackers demanded a ransom of several million euros from Sudan.
Six kidnappers were reportedly killed in a shootout before their release.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The ransom is already being negotiated.
The Germans are repeatedly targeted by kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists introduced to the Sahara appear to be free.
This was reported by the Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabiya and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to the Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health," Frattini said.
According to a report by Egyptian state television, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides, are safe and sound.
All 19 participants of the expedition to the desert are already apparently on their way to Cairo.
The background to the shootout before the hostages were released remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security official, the hijackers were ready to end the kidnapping even before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the hijackers.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed to the ransom," the worker said.
It is said that "it was only a matter of taking the hostage" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers shot dead six hijackers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and captured two of them.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper El Masri El Jom, citing one of the German intermediaries, said the release of the hostages was being delayed because the kidnappers were worried about their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men were to be held until the hijackers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuse of stepfather 'leads to suicide'
Several years of abuse by her stepfather led the woman to commit suicide, the court heard.
After confessing to eight cases of sexual harassment, Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," Trerise wrote in a confession.
The court also said Ms. Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her up and blindfolded her, then sexually abused her while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court heard that Ms. Randle, who had spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, had been haunted by the ghost of abuse that had been perpetrated on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that in 2006, friends of Ms. Randle, who was also very involved in surfing and cycling, said she was “emotionally dead” and had “given up on life.”
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her Plymouth apartment.
She is believed to have suffocated herself with a plastic bag.
Randle came face to face with his daughter’s stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with the words, “I bound her and blindfolded her.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris said: “You are an extremely strange fetishist, and it must have been terrible for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even worse is the fact that if she hadn’t done so, the case probably wouldn’t have gone to trial at all.”
"I would particularly like to highlight the consequences that Stephanie's parents believe your crime has had on their daughter over the years," he added.
"Obviously, she'd probably be a promising, successful, happy young woman."
The officer who lost the data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left top-secret documents on a train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top-secret documents on a train to Waterloo at the time he was temporarily assigned to the Department of Defense.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the least serious offense against the said law and does not indicate any criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said such a move would come as a surprise to many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought the matter was being handled internally between the ministry and the Office of the Government," he said.
An employee who cannot be named is charged under Section 8.1 of the Act in question, which is a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police charge the official on the basis of the highly sensitive nature of his work on the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents, which he had forgotten, contained a covert analysis of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraq’s security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from his home to an unknown location.
Co-operative Reserves Face B&B Debt
British co-operatives may have to deal with more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million in debt after the Bradford & Bingley bailout.
The government has provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million clients at Bradford & Bingley.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that take client deposits, including 59 cooperative deposits.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Cooperative Stock Exchange Association (BSA), said it was “humiliating” that back-ups and their members had to pay.
The $14 billion debt will eventually be repaid by bailing out the Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest that accumulates in the meantime will pay off all 700 financial firms that take client deposits every year.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan Fund for the BBC has confirmed that all 59 co-operatives are included in this figure.
It is humiliating that these institutions, which have behaved prudently... now have to repay some of the accounts of those institutions, which have by no means been so prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay proportionally to the deposits it held, and that the back-up companies should pay about 18% of the price.
The Treasury Department estimates that interest on the debt will rise to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that the back-up companies will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay interest on the first year.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the cooperatives trade association, told the BBC he was convinced it was unfair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that behaved prudently during the boom of the housing market now have to pay off some of the accounts of those institutions that were far from so prudent."
According to the BSA, no backups have fallen since 1945 when they appeared.
“We will need to explore all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what the options are to protect cooperatives and their members from an account that could be substantial,” Cole added.
The interest payable in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be payable for the whole year, and this could be almost twice as much.
Since cooperative back-ups are joint-stock organizations without shareholders, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk is 5 pence per litre.
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pence per litre from Monday.
This is the second increase in prices this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after research conducted by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves whether they want to reflect the price increase in customer prices.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Bangladeshi ex-prime minister's bail denied
A Bangladeshi court has rejected former Prime Minister Shaikh Hasina Wajid's request for bail, meaning she could be arrested if she returns to her homeland.
Her lawyers said the court refused to release her on bail in connection with the charge that she had obtained over fifty million takas ($729,700) from a certain businessman by blackmailing her when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several corruption charges brought against her.
Khalida Ziya, a longtime political rival of Shaikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Shaikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the local army-held government first give her complete freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was released on parole to undergo medical treatment abroad, the terms of her release make it unclear whether she will remain at large when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she is now appealing to the Supreme Court against the order.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Shaikh Hasina's bail application, saying that she does not need bail when she is already being examined abroad and released for a sworn statement," her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said in a statement.
"We will appeal the Supreme Court's order."
Her lawyers said she needed bail so she could return to the country from abroad in preparation for the December election.
A senior League official said Shaikh Hasina was due to return home after Oct. 17.
She was detained last year after the army-held interim government took power, but was released from prison in June to be able to go abroad for medical treatment.
Shaykh Hasina and Khalid Ziya have both denied all charges against each other.
Fear of polio vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 children have not taken part in recent polio vaccinations due to Taliban-related violence.
Last week, the UN carried out vaccinations in six provinces.
However, she says she was unable to reach children in southern parts of Helmand and Kandahar for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said that despite Taliban promises not to attack or prevent thousands of vaccine workers from working.
BSkyB loses ITV lawsuit
BSkyB lost a court case on the review of the Commission’s competition decision ordering the company to reduce its stake in the competing broadcaster ITV.
The BSkyB Competition Court of Appeal ordered it to reduce its shareholding in ITV from 17,9 % to 7,5 %.
The Commission had previously stated that BSkyB’s shareholding had undermined the competition and had given the company a disproportionate influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought a stake in the store in 2006, which prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Authority announced that the acquisition of an interest in ITV by BSkyB had cast doubt on the independence of ITV and called on the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
Virgin consortium chief Sir Richard Branson, consumer organisations and Ofcom regulator were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its stake in ITV was unwise and disproportionate - primarily because BSkyB had previously said it was willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation into U.S. attorneys' affair
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The move came at a time when a report on the affair by the Justice Department’s inspector general criticized the actions of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Justice Minister Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by concerns that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Counsel Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials interrogated during the investigation lied to investigators in order to obstruct justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine said in a report: “Serious allegations including potential criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or explained.”
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice removed nine U.S. attorneys from their positions in December 2006.
At the time, the ministry said the lawyers had been dismissed because of poor performance.
However, it later turned out that the lawyers’ dismissals were not rated any worse than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissals were politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in prosecuting high-ranking Republican lawmakers and senators, while others refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against Democrats.
U.S. attorneys investigate and prosecute in court cases for the government.
They may be released at any time but may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, came under fire for the dismissal and eventually resigned.
A number of other Justice Department officials also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was highly critical of Gonzales' role in the affair, saying he bore "the primary responsibility" for the dismissal, that he "abdicated" from his leadership position and was "not remarkably involved" in the matter.
Other officials, including former senior Bush adviser Karel Rove, have been criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf's masterpiece will be awarded
Rock star Meat Loaf will receive one of the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will attend a ceremony in London next weekend for his special gold award, said he was "honored" by the recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
This year’s nomination is led by Coldplay, which was shortlisted in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q Magazine, said: “There are some songs that stand above such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them.”
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed great vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It began with the instrumental part, which lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK in 1979 as a single and peaked at number 15.
But Meat Loaf’s album Bat Out Of Hell stayed on the charts for about nine years and sold more than forty million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, in 2003 he was also operated on due to an irregular heart rhythm after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Later it turned out that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscure street, often forgotten and maybe soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other roads, some famous, others only utility.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and longtime locals have trouble finding Extra Place, mostly because they’ve never heard of it.
This tiny alley is in the East Village neighborhood and leads north from First Street - without getting to Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and a length of forty meters, it resembles a dusty passage rather than a traffic jam.
There are no signs with street names.
In a common atlas, it is practically invisible.
Still, the street has admirers.
For example, the company Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
Extra Place wants to re-pave and create a cleaner gateway to the shops and boutiques to be opened in the new buildings.
Other admirers are longtime neighbors who say they were charmed by the shortened alley simply because it was one of the last remnants of the time before the block was refined.
However, the city’s Office for the Protection and Development of Development, which has the street in its power, has no interest in sticking to it.
At a meeting of the municipal community land committee, representatives of the city office and the company Avalon Bay outlined a plan according to which the developer should buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, District Manager of the Municipal Community 3, the committee prefers such a variant, when the street will remain in the hands of the city, and asked for a new plan, which should be submitted next month.
"The city already owns very little land, and we would like Extra Place to remain his property," she said.
"There could be proposals for repair and management, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it wants to re-pave the small street and set up seating areas, several of which would be used by the cafe, whose interest in renting the space the developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first announced at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not necessarily want to own it.
“The main intention of Avalon Bay is to repair this desolate alley and make it a beautiful place for the public,” she said, adding that the sale was designed by the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Office for the Conservation of Development, said the city did indeed want to sell the street, noting that his office’s job was to develop rather than manage the property.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place has left a shallow mark on history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorn’s large farm was divided among several of his children, and no one claimed that narrow strip of land.
The back door of the CBGB, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, led to Extra Place, and the alley is perhaps best known as the background photo on the cover of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia".
“The place was amazing,” says Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers who write about ennobling the East Village district, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place and argue that that piece of public property, however modest, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity - an almost unchanged piece of the city, which should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiah’s Disappearing New York (subtitled “The Book of Mourning: A Bitterly Nostalgic View of the City in the Dying Process”), posted part of the story of Extra Place from the Let’s Talk About the City column that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow dead end, dark even in the daytime, bounded by rusty iron doors of warehouses and battered windows, where a week-old newspaper runs through the gutters."
With a few exceptions, the alleyway looked exactly the same on a recent evening.
The rat ran across the dead end of the street near the door that once led to the CBGB, which now houses an expensive clothing store.
There was graffiti on the walls, and beside a fresh batch of discarded newspapers was an empty beer bottle.
A few passers-by said he rarely thought of Extra Place, but suggested he might need some kind of boost.
Fields, by contrast, said he thinks some people underestimate the efficiencies of the alley in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in dark, damp, and hideous places."

Obama’s campaign notes that “African-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” which is true.
To combat such performance differences, Obama’s education agenda promotes, among other things, “transient bilingual education” for those who are just learning English.
The question for Barack Obama, however, remains whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in the classroom, is stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in East Los Angeles County.
The students of this school are in the vast majority of cases Hispanics from low-income families.
More than a third of students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are still learning English.
Nevertheless, in the state tests of mathematics in 2008, an incredible one hundred percent of fourth-graders reached the highest level.
Almost the same amazing ninety-three percent of fourth graders have reached the highest level in state tests of English language and literature.
This incredible success was achieved by a method other than the one preferred by Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, constant assessment of abilities, and an unexcused approach.
Further, and this should be noted, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school’s pedagogical approach for those who are just learning English is “total immersion.”
Immersion in English emphasizes the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who is against bilingual education, told me: “We had a tremendous success with a brand new student from Mexico – after twelve months you would walk into a class and not know who it was.”
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for what other schools with large proportions of Hispanic and English-speaking students should look like?
The school’s results should make the answer to this question self-evident, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Education Association has been a longtime advocate of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education obscure the prediction of Obama’s answer.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the matter by saying that people should stop worrying about “only English” laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wants to erase performance differences, he should think carefully about the educational patterns that work, rather than mock them and trivialize them.
Oil falls sharply due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday amid fears that even a U.S. plan to save financial markets might not revive the economy.
The prices of futures oil fell in the morning trading on the New York Commodity Exchange by as much as 7 percent to $ 99.80 per barrel.
Since Monday, prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by financial turmoil on Wall Street and a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After hitting a high of $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, followed by huge financial market uncertainties.
Worries again gripped investors on Monday, even after the Congressional Presidium announced it had reached an agreement over the weekend on the largest rescue plan in history.
This report has been overshadowed by fresh fears that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the unfolding dissolution, the government announced that Citigroup would acquire Wachovia Corporation's banking division.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the frantic weekend talks that led to a plan to rescue the economy "appear to be unable to revive market sentiment."
As the economic situation worsens, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to fall.
“The outlook for markets with global equities, interest rates and exchange rates has been highly uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a report to investors.
"We believe commodities will not be able to escape the contagion.
“From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is the extent to which the U.S. virus will spread around the world, and especially to China.”
Analysts at the bank have reduced their expectations for next year as oil consumption has fallen due to slower economic growth, and have lowered their gasoline price forecasts for 2009 by about 20%.
A wild ride in the second quarter broke the team's record
After spending more time in the Jets than anyone else over the past eight seasons, defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he’d seen it all.
Then on Sunday, he watched the development of the second quarter, in which the Jets turned a pointless game into a spaniel ride.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals faced the grim clouds above them with their troubled game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranues Coles on a twelve-yard touchdown sprint, perfectly foreshadowing an afternoon in which their gradually developing collaboration had moved miles forward.
Favre sent Coles in the quarter after two touchdowns, including the one in which the cornerback fell, and another 10 seconds before the half of the game.
"It was nothing extraordinary," Favre said of all his passes to Coles.
"He's a damn good player.
We had a great conversation, no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles tossed, the defense attacked Kurt Warner's Cardinals quarterback.
Cornerback Darelle Revis picked up a stray throw and returned it 32 yards to the touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith picked up another pass and caught it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner to fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced, was perhaps the best ever.
The Cardinals got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard goal from the field, taking the lead 34-0.
That's the most the Jets have ever won in a quarter.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, when asked to describe the madness, said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both - the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without an answer - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
Many points were scored in a short period of time.”
Gebreselassie breaks his world record
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best long-distance runner ever when he broke his own world record on Sunday in the Berlin Marathon and became the first person to run a 26.2-mile race in under two hours and four minutes.
By winning on a pleasantly flat track in the time of 2:03:59, he overcame his previous time of 2:04:26, which ran last year in Berlin, by 27 seconds.
Gebreselassie, who is 35, has set the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - he has broken the world record or is at least the world champion at all distances from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon because he feared - perhaps too much in retrospect - that the polluted air would irritate his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - Gebreselassie won on Sunday with a lightning-fast average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya focused on longer runs, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebreselassie told reporters he had calf cramps two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
The break seemed to wake him up rather than delay him.
"I'm so happy," Gebreselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
A week ago I started again and I was a little doubtful today, but everything was fine.”
He has also been criticized – particularly in Kenya, Ethiopia’s East African rival – for allegedly over-planning his races, generally avoiding the world’s top marathon runners, relying on conductors as if it were a track race, and setting world records above the sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly detract from Gebreselassie’s enormous running quality.
Maintained at a pace of four Kenyans reached Gebreselassie half in the time 1:02:04.
After the conductors fell off, two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, chased Gebreselassie.
A little earlier than three miles ahead of the finish, Gebreselassie last took and escaped to Kwambai, who then finished second in 2:05:36 and improved his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race ended an excellent year with the seventh fastest time in history 2:19:19 Irina Mikit<0xC4><0x9B>nková, a native of Kazakhstan, who is now a citizen of Germany.
The record time of 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliffe from Great Britain.
Mikit<0xC4><0x9B>nková, 36, surprisingly won the London Marathon last spring at 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games due to what has been described as a back injury, but recovered and won in Berlin and improved her personal best by almost five minutes in the third marathon she ever ran.
She ran the race smartly and thoughtfully: she let four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners escape to a big lead, and then, after about 18 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 miles, she finished them off.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second at 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop of Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
Pride and Obstacles to Black Life in a Separate City
Hidden among the sprawling amusement parks of Greater Orlando, a few miles from everything shiny, noisy and huge, lies a quiet city where the pride and rigor of African-American life comes to life.
Eatonville, the first completely black city to be incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquettes, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, plenty of quail, two schools."
Now it is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville festival Zora! to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains a sideshow, though she made it a stopover for tourists by including it in a Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers Project during the economic crisis.
It’s still as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and didn’t share their true feelings with a white man who “knows so little about us that he doesn’t even know what he’s missing.”
Even today, in a year when the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open debate about race, many of the residents here remain wary of foreign views.
“We pay a lot of attention to how our story is told,” said Hortense Jones, 59, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the oldest parish in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It is both a historical model of black ascendancy and a community of nearly 2,400 people, where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a center of literature, but also an oak shaded example of Southern rural black culture – sometimes despised, sometimes praised – that arose from American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the locals are both proud and protective.
And worries about Eatonville really began with Zora, which is the only way Hurston is called here.
She introduced the world to her hometown through heartwarming books such as Mules and Men (1935) and Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937).
The five paragraphs of the Florida tourist guide turned the city a little bit into Route 17, which leads through the often-missing center of Florida, a stage of black history and human drama.
With the birth of the great drum in both life and literature, Hurston led readers to the shop of the first Eatonville mayor, Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"To the left of the road," she wrote, "is a white, brown-decorated modern national school with well-maintained yards and playgrounds that Howard Miller always looks after, even though he can't read or write much."
She also mentioned the widow’s new husband, Dash, and wrote that Lee Glenn “sells drinks of all kinds and anything that fits in a one-hour hotel.”
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
This was obviously not a typical Fodor's publishing house.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
“Zora said it the way it was,” says 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson’s girls who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered here as a chippy freak who often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin remembers that most of the time, when she arrived in the city, she arrived unannounced in a huge Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still proud of decent dress.
Most residents were fascinated, Franklin said, but many grinned.
"People have always liked to see Dawn," Franklin said.
But, he added, rocking in a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were taken out of print.
Eatonville seemed to have forgotten it, along with the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had previously lived.
There were no major mourning ceremonies or large public readings in Eatonville.
“I don’t think they understood its meaning to the world or its legacy,” said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston’s 2003 biography Wrapped in Rainbows.
The change came in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to stretch the city's five-lane highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local two-lane main road.
Orlando's ascent has already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still getting out of a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, the struggle to mix races brought hatred to the doorstep of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white guys, they came in and threw oranges and stuff at the people who were sitting on the side," Franklin said.
"Actually, we had a lady who was killed.
They threw watermelon out of the car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's demand for forced integration and said Brown's decision against the Education Chamber was "more offensive to my race than glorious."
Residents now claim that the desegregation of schools, although positive in some areas, has reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the local youth.
“Black kids were used to hugging — I remember — you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening,” said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Elly Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
It took as long as the teachers and students came from the same place, she added.
"You don't hug your white teacher because your white teacher -- I mean, there's a cultural barrier," Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, has helped create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons—black writers, actors, and artists who, like her, have risen above prejudice with frivolous self-confidence and quotes such as “How can anyone deny the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker arrived at Hurston's unmarked grave and began fighting to revive her reputation.
Five years later, Robert E. Hemenway's acclaimed biography of Hurston re-introduced her to the American canon.
The highway project arrived just as Eatonville's most famous daughter had found the ramp lights again.
The former Hurston neighbors now regarded her as a savior.
To show what might happen to its highway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived for the inaugural event two years later, and every January many return to celebrate.
After a few years, the state withdrew from the highway proposal.
"These five highway streams have resurrected, you would say, directly detonated, real civic pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd put it simply: "Dawn saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped to change the image of the city.
Outsiders such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began attending the church in 1993, began to appear in larger numbers, and residents began to reassess the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando can sometimes act as a sunken alley in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(He is now 90 percent black.)
Strangers who come to seek the story and meaning of Eatonville are still often treated with caution.
Permission for most interviews is required in advance, and certain things - such as wall paintings in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by whites and depicting blacks in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, a bold, self-assured teacher who likes deep red, still fear that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And as the Hurston Festival grew, so did domestic pride.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville the way Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with problems, and so on, but no better, no worse, and just as proud, creative, hardworking, foolish, and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, has a genuine love for the community as he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or the police, who he says would use some help.
And even younger ones, such as the eleven-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alex Kenon, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, if they just walk through here, they think, 'Uh, this town is nothing against the others,'" Alondra Kenon said recently after church.
"But if you really stop and look at history for a moment, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, we all speak fluently financially
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from newspaper stands and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never have guessed that in the bee hive of offices above their heads, every day, the bankers and investment fund managers who monopolize New York City are having the worst “bad day at the office” since the 1929 crisis.
Messengers still rattle metal carts on the sidewalks and carry muffin casseroles to breakfast meetings.
The Spaniards are still moving among the skyscrapers and wearing, like human mules, fifty ironed shirts hanging from the pendulums on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the street dining stalls, and it is still not possible to get a yellow cab on a weekday between four and seven in the afternoon.
It didn’t seem like a crisis at all until, with all the talk of pessimism, I decided to set up a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Despite the fact that I had timed this task to cover the late afternoon siesta at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, there were already about twenty people waiting in line.
Not in front of checkout windows to pick up or store cash, but in front of a counter where older clients order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to the Macy's mixed-goods store, and new customers set up accounts.
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Starr, my “licensed personal banker,” came for the same reason I did.
However, compared to me, they have already taken their savings from smaller banks in places where they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They took money from so-called “thrifts” (a bit like construction savings banks), money unions, and those types of savings banks whose branches operate in only one state and which claim to take care of their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks have quietly failed.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers were returning home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in assets, was trying to catch a rescue buyer.
The employees of the offices and shops that stood in front of me and were afraid of another collapse moved their cash to a bank that is perceived as a safe haven and that does most of the rescuing on Wall Street.
Over the past week, ordinary New Yorkers have learned a lot financially.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, that bankrupt bank, and her emaciated chief executive Dick Fulda with such familiarity as if she were gossiping about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed, roughly 50-year-old housekeeper of my apartment building, changed the subject of our ordinary conversation — Brad, Angelina, or my grocery delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, “I now have my savings in money market funds.
I moved it, I won't risk it."
Muslim Graves Desecrated After Austrian Right-Wing Fault
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left, from the Austrian right-wing Svobodn<0xC3><0xBD>ch party and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang party are taking part in the demonstration, which was presented in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 by the organization "Cities against Islamization".
They carry signs similar to traffic signs that show mosques crossed out by a red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend in which far-right parties made huge gains in general elections.
More than 90 graves at a cemetery in the town of Traun near Linz were severely damaged sometime between Friday evening and this morning, and police believe it was an organized event.
The culprits sprayed Jewish symbols such as the Star of David on some graves, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask extremist motives driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident was linked to the election.
A spokesman for the Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by reports of desecration coming as the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan nears its end.
Meanwhile, Austria is embarking on a search for its own soul after a right-wing surge in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties, which together won more than 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, have vehemently campaigned against immigration, and some of their slogans have been criticized as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party, which won more than 18 percent of the vote, protested against headscarves and burqas in the campaign and even expressed his opposition to food with a perceived relationship to Islam.
At his last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which put the extreme right in the position of the strongest political bloc in the country, suggest that this change was caused primarily by young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to travel abroad.
Gary Glitter, a glam rock star who has been convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
Officials imposed the six-month ban on Glitter after it informed monitoring authorities that it planned to travel via France to Spain.
The travel ban was agreed to by Kent police last Thursday after they handed over evidence of Glitter’s past convictions for child sexual abuse to officials.
Glitter, in his own name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford’s lowest criminal court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said: “On Thursday 25 September, the Kent Police asked the Ashford High Criminal Court for a regulation to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the border into France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally involved.
The 64-year-old Glitter has informed authorities that he wishes to travel abroad, according to a record in the sex offender registry.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
They must also hand over the planned departure date to the police one week in advance.
If he fails to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
Kent police have announced that they will not discuss individual cases of Glitter's possible trips around the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said: “The Kent Police will do whatever is necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to track someone who stays in the UK, because we have extensive systems here that handle potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting Kent residents is a top priority for Kent police, and we are working closely to monitor the behaviour of recorded sexual offenders to minimise any danger to the public.”
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was to board a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused to allow him in, and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On 22 August, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there while his solicitor, David Corker, went to Uxbridge’s lowest criminal court in West London and at the same time, Scotland Yard successfully requested an order ordering him to register as a sex offender.
Glitter was previously jailed in the UK for four months for possessing child pornography.
A source from the interior ministry said that Jacqui Smith, the interior minister, was calm and glad that Glitter had been prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To capture the real character, I photograph the master off-stage." G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no frills, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, detached from the focus on interpretation - just so I can achieve a relaxed expression of a man or a woman.
An artist on the one hand.
On the other hand, a man.
Inseparable, except for privacy, in those moments far from the audience - then you can see a confidential gesture, the depth of a fleeting glance or passionate gestures of hands that are carefree, because they are not going to come out on stage.
German G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer alternates the theatricality of performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with the lesser-known face of the masters in "Flamenco-people".
With this intention, the photographer compiles a unique iconography of flamenco from different backgrounds.
The exhibition, which takes place as part of the Month of Flamenco Photography (Mes de la Fotograf<0xC3><0xAD>a Flamenca) program, “reflects the ever-increasing international importance of flamenca,” the author says, explaining that “Flamenco-people” “can be any kind of people, but when you look at the photos, you will find that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists able to bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and completely captivate the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that will allow me to capture the personality of the giants of flamenco.
Enchanted by the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began a long journey of portraying flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on a plate camera in 1997.
They are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, resemble a classic photo.
The use of different stylistic means contradicts the classical basis of the picture and lends it a contemporary spirit, an idea that, according to Bauer himself, even flamenco reflects: "Music with very traditional roots, but which does not cease to surprise and develop."
What captivates the audience is not the action of the dance itself, singing or playing, but the personality and character of the artist.
The search for the moment when we will encounter the most essential, the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and experiencing, that was and is the constant of the work presented during these days in the El Fotomata gallery.
This selection of almost seventy photographed artists is formed by famous flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco and will soon receive a book edition, which will contain exhibited portraits.
Two years ago, Bauer's passion for portraiture led to the idea of repeating the idea on "Portraits of a Sports Veteran" ("SportARTproject").
Although their concept is different from “Flamenco-people”, the photographer admits that “taking pictures of people, getting to know them and being able to enter their lives for a moment, whether longer or shorter – that’s my passion.
I think in photography, portraiture is the most difficult genre.
A person meets or clashes with people, personalities that he sometimes does not even know, or they give him only a few minutes to take a photo.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.”
A collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenco called "Flamenco-people" is on display at the Galeria El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata in the street de la Mata 20, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the novel he is writing is “audacity”
Set in an environment he does not yet know, and tells of events unknown to him, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully implement his new project - he is currently working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived for twenty years in the Congo and traveled in the Amazon.
The perennial favourite of the Nobel Prize for Literature admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia that the project he is currently working on is “audacity” and that “everything suggests I shouldn’t write” this novel.
"If I had any sense, I wouldn't do it, but I will, and I believe I'll finish it one day," he concluded at the festival of ideas, thoughts and words, which he saw in the city of the aqueduct about a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people.
The author of the novel "City and Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year of the celebration of the word and met expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for the most popular writer - the old edition of Dickens' "Our Mutual Friend" - filled the Juan Bravo Theatre to the last place.
With Felix Romeo, who introduced him, he had before him a devoted audience, to whom an hour of time passed like water - a Peruvian with amazing accuracy and a remarkable dose of humor remembered how in him from the original "incredible adventure" from the "pleasure of a passionate reader" and from "the power to live more than I have lived"
The Spanish-American novelist admitted that "there is no way" to find out whether and to what extent books can change lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is mere entertainment, a fleeting experience" - Vargas Llosa stressed, according to him, "it affects people" and "makes them "to try to deviate from the line," and he said, "to make them feel responsible."
Due to climatology, he loses the ceremony in Pooblanec - a spear is missing
The performance with the lances, which concludes the ceremony in Pozoblanco, was canceled yesterday morning after the announcement of the performers that the surface of the square is not in good condition was confirmed.
Therefore, the company, together with Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Boh<0xC3><0xB3>rquez, Pablo Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfights.
Unfavorable weather conditions have plagued this celebration for a long time, and two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday, the rain made it impossible for the second bullfights to take place.
During them, the formations of José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>az and Juan Bautista were to stand up to the bulls in the arena at Castilblanco.
This was only celebrated on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and the reward for a dynamic and aesthetically high performance was carried on his shoulders.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante exchanged two blows with a lance for a salute and one ear, brought to him by the bare seats in the arena rather than by Toreadorian art.
Even worse was El Juli, who walked through the Los Llanos bullring unsalted and oily.
In the second round of hard work, without a single breath, he received harsh criticism from most of the audience.
They escaped control in <0xC3><0x81>lava in a van with two thousand kilograms of hashish
Ten minutes, five.
Ertzaintza road control in the city district of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
The members stop two people in the van and they leave.
The cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is unstoppable.
According to a report by the Basque Government's Department of the Interior, they were harassed and detained by one of the people in the van, a 38-year-old man who was identified as A.A.J.
He was charged with drug smuggling and falsification of state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit were carrying out road checks on the N-1 in places where it passes the border of the city district of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n.
They were going to stop the van for inspection, but the driver disobeyed orders, accelerated sharply and got away.
Members of the car immediately began to pursue, until the vehicle stopped at the roadside a few kilometers away, at which point both passengers jumped out and fled into the forest.
Ertzaintzy finally caught up with one of them and seized 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects were transporting, as it turned out during the inspection of the Iveco Daily brand van.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with packages of hashish, which were then transported to other police departments for detailed examination and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the police found that the license plate was “crushed” and did not agree with the data provided in the delivery documents, so the detainee was also accused of falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to search for the second suspect who, as already mentioned, managed to escape in order to finally determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old detainee, A.A.J., was transferred to the police department for proper formalities before proceeding with further investigation.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the favorite Amanda from the series Melrose Place, was detained this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers as she tried to drive out of a parking lot in Montecito, a California Highway Patrol spokesman told People magazine.
The witness stated that at 4:30 p.m., Locklear was "drastically stepping on the gas, driving back and forth in a noisy roar, trying to get out of the parking space - she rolled her sunglasses back and forth several times."
The witness, who didn’t seem to recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear a moment after stopping on a nearby highway and getting out of the vehicle.
The person also alerted the emergency services because “they were worried about Locklear’s life.”
When police arrived at the scene, they found the actress inside the vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented," so the officers took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to be tested.
According to the police spokesman, the actress cooperated and the excessive amount of alcohol was then excluded, however, "we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some drugs, which was evident to the officers at first glance."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was taken into custody around 7 p.m., although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a treatment clinic where she was recovering from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian association IU to exercise its powers in the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, the chief executive of the IU and an MP for the United Left, said today that the final decision in the case of Francisco Manuel Silva, a former youth and sports councillor in Seville, who stepped down last week after being accused of acting on behalf of his family, would depend on the party’s regional association.
"I'm too federalist for that, it's up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares said, suggesting a move the party would have to take on a former member of Seville's city council.
However, the IU chief insisted that "transparency" was absolutely necessary in the case of an investigation of an illegal act committed by Silva: "The IU has always fought to make such matters as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions".
"May Blood" ('Sangre de mayo'), an epic bet by Garcia
José Luis Garcia in Sangre de mayo, inspired by episodes from Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s’ national past, revives the famous Spanish uprising against the French – the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "draw the eloquence of the characters and the analysis of society", which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today, together with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a, during the presentation of the film in front of a large team of interpreters.
The two-and-a-half-hour May Blood will be released in theaters this Friday, and a four-hour series for Telemadrid is set to air in the future.
As a great admirer of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s’ literary work, José Luis Garci claims that he fulfilled his “child’s dream” by making this film, thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago for the Autonomous Province of Madrid to make a film for the 200th anniversary of Madrid’s 2 May, he accepted the offer, saying that the story would come from Epiduro.
The $15 million budget, to which the province of Madrid contributed entirely, meant for Garcia a "unique opportunity" to create an environment with scenery and costumes corresponding to the image of "a crumbling Spain that was mistaken in a leader for whom it was possible to fight - the struggle for independence led under Ferdinand VII to decline and fall behind.
The director regrets, however, that he cannot count on the financial support that went to the films The Sorrowful Wing (Ala triste) or Goya's Ghosts - almost twice as much as May Blood -, so he could not make some scenes from the script signed simultaneously by Horace Valcárcel, with whom he works almost throughout his film career.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and Empezar) works as usual - on the stage together with the actors with whom he usually tries before filming and who does not choose casting, because he finds it "humiliating" and also believes that "part of the director's profession is, among other things, to go to the theater and go to the theater."
Many of the actors he chose for May’s Blood appear in front of his camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garcia, with four Oscar nominations, one of which he won, is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year in front of the Hollywood Academy, the May Blood itself, the Seven Tables of the French Billiards and the last selected Blind Sunflower, represent the young generation of the Spanish film scene.
Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a does not expect any awards for this film.
“At first you think you’re working for what’s going to happen next, but then you realize you’re only working for a living, and then you give in to making one more film,” explains Garcia, who has been directing for more than 30 years.
Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n revives the spiritual legacy of Seville dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
Seville-based flamenco dancer pays tribute to another Seville-based dancer.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia, from a Catalan father (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and a Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and moved with her family to London when she was three years old.
She danced modern dances and focused on oriental dances.
She lived a life of passion, pioneering female emancipation as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, and Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and fought for the abolition of the corset, which made it impossible for women to move freely.
The life of this woman, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe, bewitched Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she designed this character for me – it seemed incredible.”
According to the dancer, "we are not talking about the story of her life, but about the capture of the soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythms of flamenco.
So the "butterfly dance" evoked a guajira or a "snake dance" of some kind of tango.
Her dance was sensual, and I was told that my dance matched that aesthetic, too.”
The performance is expected to involve two exceptional personalities: Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabele in one performance as in "La puerta abierta" (Open Door), and dance teacher Matilde Coral, who made an exception and agreed to cooperate with her former student.
"Matilde represents an older T<0xC3><0xB3>rtol, a mature figure.
I am happy that she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it is a great honor for me."
The performance also includes music and guitars by Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres and Paco Arriaga, singing by Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; drums by El Pájar, viola by Rafa El Viola, and the collaboration of the actor Juanfra Juárez, "who are the artists in this kind of eternal conductor".
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, which took place for its time in such distant places as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, because she usually stayed in London.
“I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who at one time had a huge influence, but today nobody knows her and even less appreciates her work,” Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n said.
The performance starts today at 20.30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The book "Diary of a newly married man" also closes the triennials
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of the "Newly Married Diary" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), at the place where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenob<0xC3><0xAD>a in March 1916, is part of a program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government to celebrate the "Trienále of Zenob<0xC3><0xAD>a and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n's Death" (Triennial of 2006).
The "Triennale of Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n" is coming to an end with a new edition of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, the repair of the Nobel Museum House, and the traveling exhibition "Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: The Sun Ray" which was to open in May this year, and after the Congress will tour the various Andalusian provinces.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Government of Andalusia also ordered eight hundred copies of the "Diary of the Newly Married" edited by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue to spread awareness of the personality and work of one of Andalusia's most worldly poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn’t like each other so much anymore.
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.
These are the words of the actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "No Evil Intentions" and under the weight of the knowledge that Newman has left, reveals her disillusioned vision of abandoned American cinema and all of America.
Look how long it took them to get an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be gravely ill.
He was a man for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels cannot be expressed in any way, and I have now lost a great friend,” Robert Redford said in tears, “my life and my country have been better because of him.”
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
The father of film and country died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American self-confidence is at the bottom, when they are desperately looking for reasons to be proud.
When times are harsh and people without virtues and only a handful of those who are worthy of your admiration - you don't need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for both lost and won cases, from a drug-addiction foundation founded in honor of his first-born son, who died of an overdose, to his own brand of homemade food and organic foods.
A complete treasure for the country, which cost a lot of effort to get rid of the suicidal food culture.
A tumultuous wave of admiration flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that not one man died, but an entire era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was without exaggeration the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest source of inspiration.
“This fox has set a pretty high bar for all of us,” says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who has the courage to try to live like Paul Newman these days — he’s built on honesty and leads a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy, sometimes even possible, in today’s media jungle.
But fortunately, people like that are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He had divorced once, and since then he had been married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, whom he had been faithful to, although he certainly had more than enough opportunities not to be.
"Why would I go out for a burger when I have a filet at home?" he liked to joke.
Let him be proud in heaven that there is harmony on earth between his daughters and his admirers - this is not very common in America.
Of all the great roles he played, he is said to have been the most proud of his role as a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather, and a self-sacrificing philanthropist.
The Imperfect Races of Olympic Madrid
Yes, many of us long for the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after a failed 2012 it will be maybe 2016.
But I ask: are we ready?
If we run yesterday's race, I say no!
It was referred to as the perfect race, and in my opinion it was the worst race I've ever been to.
Such a load of nonsense that if there was an evaluation and I was the examiner, it would be clearly insufficient.
But let's look at it from the beginning, one by one.
Nonsense begins with the collection of the race number, because of which one has to go early.
I don’t think that’s a bad thing, but when a person goes there, let them give him everything (including a chip that is supposed to prevent overcrowding).
Oh, no, no.
Here one had to pick up the number first (the first nonsense, go there just for that) and (after getting up the proper queue) - what a surprise! - they only had a T-shirt of size S (the second nonsense, because I need a size XL).
Where do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small T-shirts, because it is less fabric and they are cheaper?
Well, these are small things compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that it had to go very early for the chip and the queue took him more than 15 minutes, the backpack had to go there.
It took over 35 minutes of waiting time, which is a race where 11,000 people are expected, something incomprehensible.
So, as you might expect, the race started and we haven’t put our backpacks down yet, and when we did, it was much worse with the pickup.
In addition, the wait was extended by 40 minutes of rain, which led to a general riot and an attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow and some, like me, will not see the right time in the evaluation of the results because of the chip they gave me and which, I assume, did not record the start time correctly.
Of course, if someone asked me about a perfect race, I wouldn't have thought of this one.
So I guess we'll just have to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At a conference on new technologies at MIT, Microsoft demonstrated further developments in the new image recognition system and human interaction on a way of artificial intelligence – not too intelligent, but able to perform basic tasks like calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger who would move around the company’s campus) and perceive what he hears in an interview.
Thanks to the camera and a system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "receptor" can detect how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
They can also categorize those present according to their conversational groups.
In the demonstration video, the receptionist records the third person and understands that he does not belong to the group that is talking to her, and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she is going to see someone, and tells her that he will be with her in a moment.
All this without the blue screen of death.
Fascinating.
Of course, this is the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
There has been a lot of talk this week about changing Microsoft’s strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer figured out that if computers had only the essentials, without the burden of commercial waste, they would be five times more powerful — man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
Discover like thunder, considering that the Microsoft version of the version adds to Windows new features and other "extra".
A change of direction would be a meritorious act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its relevance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, I became one of those who leaned into the theory that it was Google’s first step towards competing with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
An operating system will always be necessary, because it is the necessary layer to communicate between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's true.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and, on the contrary, more and more to the Internet browser.
The computer turns on to start Firefox or Explorer — or Chrome — and every day we spend more time online than around windows.
What is the purpose of half of the applications that accompany the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be smaller, much smaller than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here is a small example.
I took this photo in a restroom for Microsoft employees in Redmond earlier this month.
There was a poster on the vending machine asking them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week, a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not come in the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let’s count on 2010.
At Microsoft, they will definitely try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more a computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for the delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio in one shone in Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond", as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's "Godfather", and is also part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to go into the list of his life roles, we can dive to the image of a typical muscle man with a pointed moustache lifting dumbbells in a nomadic circus.
Basically, this is nothing more than a typical cotton men's undershirt, tight and sleeveless.
English speakers call it ‘tank’, but Le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels stands out above all others.
First, because of its name - although it is popularly called 'Marcel' - which has something to do with sport, because, as the legend says, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdano, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out above other quality cotton, unisex cut, distinctive label and (almost imperceptible) Belgian flag, which have models of the most emblematic tank tops as a detail at the neck.
And beware, because the Belgian company does not specialize only in tank tops.
It also produces college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, navy t-shirts, children's clothing, mini shorts...
Thoughtful Pieces for a Comfortable Underwear
Although it's a shame they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother. Who will be a father does not worry me."
The huge figure with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Cruz, though small, is a woman full of life.
The Cruz sisters are now taking their new role in fashion very seriously.
For M<0xC3><0xB3>nica, it means much more than just giving some pretty, famous girls their name.
In Paris, Mango took part in a promotional event held at its new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the most important fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
She's warm and shy, and she'll get you up close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present a new collection, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango for this autumn-winter season, and at the same time I attended the announcement of the second year of the "Mango Fashion Awards" and a dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
It was a challenging day, but also an exciting one.
What is the basis of your new collection for Mango, for which you have been working for the fourth season?
My sister and I love movies from the 1950s and 1960s, and we've taken a lot of inspiration from them.
I also love to wander around the city and watch women walking around dressed, combining and layering their clothes, I do this very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but after all, everything is connected and has many connections.
I liked clothes from an early age, I still wanted to go to my grandmother’s house, go through my aunt’s closets and look at her clothes.
It was a sensation, almost better than going on a pilgrimage.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to keep my clothes on.
You know, we dancers take pride in the way we're wired to feel good about our classes and exams when we look in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, that's when you really get into character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You were 30 recently, did you have a crisis?
Oh, no.
I'm feeling better than ever, I'm in my 30s.
I find that the woman is already done, has experience and enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've been doing what I want to do since I was a kid, and that gives me a lot of inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course I know I’m going to be a mother because my body demands it, and besides, I want to be a young mom, I don’t want to miss it.
As for my father, I'm not worried about that.
But one thing I know for sure, I will give my child a feeling of happiness and I will raise him with great love.
As for the movie, there are several premieres of the films you made last year.
It is, and I look forward to seeing them at the cinema.
I come from the theatrical world, so I am very impatient and restless, I want everything right now, and so of course it is not possible.
I am looking forward to the premiere of "La <0xC3><0xBA>ltima hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
Let's see how you like them...
A few days ago, you had your premiere on the runway at Naomi Campbell's side, right?
Well, don't say it.
It's not like I'm going up to the pier as a model.
I just got a call from Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, and she invited me to London to attend a benefit show for her Women for a Better Life organization, and the clothes we were showcasing -- I picked two models from our Mango collection -- were auctioned off, and the proceeds were donated to this NGO by Naomi.
People don't know that Naomi has such a good heart.
There are a lot of things being said about her, and I, because I know her, can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'm gonna stick with the good stuff he's involved in.
She asked me to perform for charity, but if she asks me to do a stand, I'll do it too.
For the benefit of third-world women, I'll do whatever it takes.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in the blood will have to install "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that a driver with three administrative penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol must install a system in his car that will prevent him from starting the car intoxicated or if he does not breathe.
The proposal became known in June this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme State Prosecutor’s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its goal is to return the driver behind the wheel, so drivers will also have to take a road re-education course.
In addition to the National Transport Safety Office, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Institute of Technology for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will also be involved in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 percent of motorists accused of driving drunk more than once get behind the wheel again in this state.
Alcolock should prevent this, as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe before or if there is a higher than allowed concentration of alcohol.
Its price exceeds 1,000 euros and it would have to be paid by the culprit himself.
A study carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that for vehicles equipped with this device, in the first year after the introduction, there was a 65 % reduction in infractions.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address this behaviour before it results in a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate its introduction, since the legislation can be carried out in the usual way, the necessary regulation of criminal provisions, however, requires an amendment of the law.
The device is not yet available in any sales version on the Spanish market, although it has already been trial-installed in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) proposal, which recommends installing this system on school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British precision, at 17.40, as stated in the program, in the presidential hangar at the airport of Benito Juárez in Mexico D. F., a plane of the Spanish air force, in which the prince and princess of Asturias arrived, landed.
The sun was just setting, but its rays still forced one to cover one's eyes with one's hand in order to see the next couple emerging from the plane.
Under the steps stood the Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish prince and princess were coming for a state visit.
- Yeah, well, that's great, it's not gonna get you to the airport to pick up people at that time... she's out of here or what...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she's lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, that's right...
However, the Mexican press knows well who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the airport hangar right next to the red carpet and the military cordon, which consists of 27 marines ready to fire an honorary salvo.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a suit of dark blue color, and the princess, very modestly dressed and with fluffy hair, does not have her usual "peeptoes", apparently reported to her that in D. F. is threatened with a storm.
Before they go to the hall where the official delegation is waiting, they smile at the photographers and pose for them.
A Mexican TV reporter is waiting for them at the door of the hotel where they will be staying, one of the four largest in the city.
Best subsidised fashion price
There is probably no better place in the world to announce a fashion award than Paris and there is probably no better designer and bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second edition of the El Bot<0xC3><0xB3>n-Mango Fashion Awards to allow international exposure to new fashion talent.
The price is subsidised by the amount of 300 000 euros.
Belgian Sandrina Fasoliová, the first-year winner, looked at her designs in the Manga exhibition on the Haussmann Boulevard in Paris yesterday and almost cried with emotion.
Sure, it is the second largest store of this company in Europe and has just opened on an area of 1,335 square meters.
The largest is in London.
Many events, together with the desire to thank the designer Valentino for taking over the presidency of the jury of the competition, caused us to finally have a sumptuous dinner at the Paris Opera Garnier.
Mango's ceremonially decorated president's desk looked even more impressive next to Chagall's finest works.
Nati, heartbroken by her brother's recent death, dressed in the brand's dress and Elah jewelry, over which she held her breath, and hung herself in front of her son Luis - an almost six-foot-tall elegant - accompanied Valentina at the head of the table at a dinner in his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, took up the welcome and, as a true gentleman, was left without a jacket with Baron Rothschild, as they had both offered them to two ladies.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Cruz, who arrived at the shop in - hand-designed - trousers and a shirt and dressed in long black sexy dresses for dinner, was touched by a night walk around the Opera House accompanied by Goya Toledo, showed us the ballroom for ballet rehearsals and, remembering the other times, she caught up with one of them.
Inés Sastre did not stop to explore the adjacent buildings of the palace, but before leaving she showed us photos of her son in a mobile phone.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the presence of Olivier Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez - another young man riding a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own sheets and towels and asked in advance not to use any scents in his rooms.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh l<0xC3><0xA0> l<0xC3><0xA0>, c'est la vie.
1001 - anti-stress number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget about the chaotic and frantic everyday life.
And to make matters worse, they are all summarized in one book, which will bring relaxation to the bookstore on September 30.
The alarm clock rings every morning at 7 am as a punishment, but it is even worse to imagine yourself absorbed in the hurried rhythm that modern life brings.
The office is called tension and computer back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
However, there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of disengagement from the world of work.
No, that number is no bigger and no less than 1001.
Outside of yoga positions, classical massages, and spa therapy, Susannah Marriott collected a whole “menu” of options on the pages of her book, tailored to each individual’s taste and timing.
The anti-stress book is called "1001 ways to relax" and thanks to the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK will bring peace to the bookstore.
If one believes that it is not possible to achieve peace in such areas as work or personal relationships, the "manual" denies this view.
In addition, it offers other procedures to be in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you no longer have adrenaline in your veins, which restores balance in the body, and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, turn off and focus on reading.
Talking from sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don’t mean the ones who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who talk while they sleep.
When it happens for the first time, it may scare you, but in reality it’s meaningless.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somniloquia.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure many of you have been told that he spoke in his sleep at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (for example, once in a lifetime with high fevers), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once every few months ...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is not just one reason for his arrival.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night rage, enuresis nocturna (night help) or sleepwalking, but this may not be the case.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fevers, stressful or troubled situations.
In any case, this is a little-studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or just the opposite (screams, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where it manifests itself with great force, it would be appropriate for the child to observe and consult a specialist to see if he has any problem that causes him great anxiety and in this way manifests itself.
We have said that it is a harmless disorder, therefore it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with apnea syndrome or with permanent stress).
However, we can do this by keeping in mind a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to disturb the child too much before he goes to sleep.
So look for calm games and avoid spooky or somewhat violent TV programs or series.
For very nervous children and those who are given work to relax, it is possible to use relaxation techniques that will help them gain some inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep more soundly.
When somniloquy appears, try to keep calm.
Remind yourself that it is harmless to the child and that he will not remember anything from what happened the next day.
Helpful advice
Don't wake him.
It's useless because he's not conscious and you're interrupting his sleep.
Even when he speaks, he sleeps, and therefore he rests.
Remember that if several times in a row it seems to you that they are very worried, it would be advisable to turn to advice or find out what causes such anxiety in a child.
If he understands what he is saying (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to question him and draw information from him.
It will be of no use, because when he sleeps, he is not conscious to organize his thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he dreams about, and therefore why he says it, so be very careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you come to.
Never tell a child that you can ask him his secrets at night.
Not even for fun.
This causes great anxiety.
Don’t worry, it’s not a bad thing, it’s just an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way back to victory after a long period of thinness.
Without having played a particularly big match, the yellow-blacks created more chances and managed to turn one of them into a winner.
The game did not have a very fast pace during this clash, in which the attackers had a hard time asserting themselves.
After the captain's first attempt to host Kauffmann, who had missed the line only a hair from a distance, Illhaeusern began to have a slight upper hand and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne by air, Romain on a long leg or also Diebold gradually came to irritate Dannemarie's defenses.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive wall in the middle of the pitch and left only the agile Riahi at the point of attack.
The beginning of the second half proved decisive, first thanks to Dannemarie's two chances with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illhaeusern, which was taken care of by Marais, well situated for processing the ball bounced after the previous Diebold's attempt (53').
However, G<0xC3><0xB3>lman Illhaeuserna did not enjoy the pleasure for a long time, after about twelve minutes he was forced to return to the dressing room and leave his teammates in a weakened state.
Dannemarie, however, was unable to capitalize on this, and eleven of the Illhaeuersern, which had withdrawn only a little to "condensate" the defense, caused no more trouble, except for the very last seconds of the match, when the ball flew very close to the beam after a great ruckus.
Sarkozy meets with angry fishermen in Paris
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes a detour through Brittany.
To face a demonstration of the strength of fishermen who on Monday severely disrupted the accessibility of several ports in Brittany and Normandy, the French president decided on Tuesday morning to go to the port of Guilvinec in Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to be adopted "in a constructive spirit" and hoped to "come up with concrete proposals".
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee" set up by Breton fishermen to take action against the sharp rise in oil prices, which reached a peak of more than 1.14 euros per liter on average.
According to Elysee Palace spokesman David Martinon, the president “will talk to them about solutions that can be imagined in order to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure the conditions of employment and payment of seafarers.”
Nicolas Sarkozy is a fisherman expected with intransigence.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out a snail operation in the Morbihan and Calvados départements, causing nearly 10km of congestion.
The holiday port of Quiberon was also blocked, but connections in the direction of Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le were not interrupted.
On the Quiberon Peninsula, a filtration dam was put into operation.
The sailors showed their determination on Monday, when, just before dawn, they were burning tyres and pallets in front of fuel depots in the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where trawlers remained in port, or Le Havre, where about twenty vessels blocked the traffic of merchant ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique region stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges during the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting at the ministry before deciding to act themselves.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" is due to decide on Tuesday on how to continue the journey and on its participation in the upcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the State Fisheries Department, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not give up anything" and "they do not want to come to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient fisheries department, for example.
Professional fishermen who do not pay the tax on diesel currently pay around 50 cents per litre, but judge that the ship’s yield threshold is reached only when the diesel is below <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman
Butch Cassidy and the Kid died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes bowed to the film’s legend and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer retains its supply assumptions for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is relying on 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of a recession hovering over the world economy.
The world’s fourth aircraft designer, Embraer, is maintaining its 2008 delivery assumptions with 215 units delivered, its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado, confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer promises a lot from the Chinese market, in particular, he takes into account the range of his aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese clients over an eight-year period.
AIG is reportedly considering ceding 15% of its assets.
The insurer American International Group, which was given over the water by US monetary authorities, is considering ceding more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion it was given as a down payment, the Financial Times reported Sunday.
AIG is ready to examine the sale of most of its non-life insurance activities in the international field and pension activities in the United States, the daily said, citing sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
AIG’s board of directors met on Sunday evening to examine a possible transfer.
It was not possible to obtain any confirmatory statements from AIG.
The assets AIG intends to divest include its airline leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in insurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments.
No final decision on these transfers has yet been taken, France Télécom continues.
AIG must quickly raise cash to repay the $85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve Bank, with the risk that the U.S. authorities will confiscate 80% of its capital, thereby diluting it to the proper ratio of the current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of the historical meeting Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange saw a historic decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson’s plan to rescue the banks: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of close to 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
The largest point decline in its history (by 684.81 points) was recorded on September 17, 2001, on the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The Nasdaq index with the predominant technology component lost, according to the final data after the close of trading, 199.61 points and stabilized at 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1 106.55 points.
Embarrassed from the start of the session, Wall Street collapsed after an unexpected rejection of the House of Representatives' plan to bail out the banks, a plan that was intended to re-establish some stability in the markets.
228 votes to 205 for the representatives refused to provide the Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson with the funds he requested.
Two out of three Republicans rejected the plan.
“It’s a bad signal sent to the market that Congress is not able to accept a certain plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market has relied on this plan," she added, expressing concern that the project adopted in a few days would not come "too late".
“If this project is indeed doomed (...), the relay will be immediately handed over to the Fed and other central banks to aflame the crisis, which would further strengthen credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And with an emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Piegza noted that in the United States, "every new day brings the downfall of a financial institution."
After Friday's collapse, Washington Mutual organized the authorities to buy back Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has taken a sudden turn and called for urgent intervention in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are facing “not just the US crisis, but a global crisis,” the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen sharply.
Cash-deposit income for 10 years fell to 3.632 % compared to 3.827 % on Friday evening, while income for 30 years fell to 4.161 % compared to 4.357 % the previous day.
Obama Wins Points in First TV Duel
The first debate between the two candidates in the White House on Friday was followed by a second debate to determine which of the pair, John McCain and Barack Obama, had won.
The Republican-Democrat campaign was not surprised when the two announced their victory in a televised duel watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, decent as it was, was not “brilliant” enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, a decline in polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose poll published on Saturday gave Obama a five-point lead (49% versus 44% for McCain), said the Democrat was the winner.
Among the undecided voters who matter right now, Obama is the winner for 39% of those polled, while, according to a CBS poll, 25% attributed the victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday through the expected good performance of his co-candidate, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
It’s a gift,” Bill Clinton said over the weekend.
Seventeen-year-old McCain has consistently highlighted his undeniable experience in foreign policy, while emphasizing his opponent’s “na<0xC3><0xAF>veté” on issues that formed the core of the first encounter.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to have understood that..." was a repeated accusation.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has enough experience and knowledge to become president,” he said.
In such an aggressive spirit, Republican television spots have been aired since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that he represents the future.
He did not lose his head and proved to be concise and precise.
He emphasized his ability to make the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
“McCain still didn’t get it, while Obama did,” said a Democratic spot this weekend that reproaches the Republican for not taking enough into account the impact of the crisis on “the average American.”
"During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama told 20,000 people gathered at a rally in North Carolina in the pouring rain.
Nor did he say words like "middle class" or "working." The financial collapse clearly favors Obama, whom Americans consider more fit to save an economy on the brink.
"There could be a decisive turnaround next week," Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, likened Obama’s “economic foresight” to that of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current disaster is “the ultimate verdict of an eight-year-old bad economic policy, as pursued by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite Wall Street’s unexpected jumps, he should be able to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans, and also noted that realizing the country’s eventual energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy sources is his number one priority, along with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates cautiously avoided questions about the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) bailout plan passed by Congress last night, which is strongly unpopular.
"Have you noticed that there have been elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening just after the polls closed in Minsk's main square to protest against the irregularity of parliamentary elections.
Although no results have yet been announced, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko's regime: "dictator, resignation".
Some admit that they did not even go to the polls: "What would it be if they would do whatever they wanted with my voice anyway," says one young man.
They do not believe that this regime, which has been friendly to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to make a turn towards democracy.
The sanctions, which include a visa ban on 40 Belarusian heads of state and the freezing of some assets, could be lifted if the election is deemed clean by observers.
According to the opposition, this was not the case.
"We were kept away from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to take part in the vote count," complained Juri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse grouping of 12 parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," emphasizes Alexander Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leading figure in the pro-European movement, "because it is important who counts the votes, and in our country it is the executive branch.
If any opposition MPs get into parliament, it will be by being appointed and not by being elected.
Their entry into parliament, however, can mean space on television, meetings in the regions, and bills.”
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in the political functioning, because "it is necessary to start a dialogue with the European Union.
For if our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, is hit by a crisis and we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the elections, will not declare the elections valid.
He stresses that participation seems to be too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the way to all possible manipulations.
"What about you, have you noticed that there were any elections?" asks Social Democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"There was no foot in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, those who are most suited to the regime."
The silence of the night was again in the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate each other on their success.
Interview - Blood that is safe again
Yesterday, Héma-Québec celebrated its tenth anniversary, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, rightly rejoiced that Héma-Québec had become one of the most reliable and efficient blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, he has regained the public’s trust, which was seriously shaken by the blood-contaminated scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
As is widely known, the national blood reserve administered by the Transfusion Department of the Canadian Red Cross was contaminated with the immune deficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and the wave of public discontent, the Canadian Government launched a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at explaining the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and making recommendations not to repeat such a disaster.
While Judge Krever delayed the submission of the report, some provinces put in place a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Québec, the Gélineau Committee took up this role.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were set up in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which was to manage Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society for supplying all provinces and both territories.
“When Hema-Québec began its activities in 1998, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the Québec blood system,” Dr. Décary recalls.
"The situation was deplorable.
Through continuous efforts to increase the safety of blood products and constant work in this area over the next years, we have regained public confidence," he says and proudly adds that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the Québec population already trusted Héma-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is something very fragile."
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
“At that time, we saw many cases of human-like mad cow disease in Europe, a new variant of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,” says a woman who has run the company since its founding in 1998.
"And we had no idea that this disease could spread through blood.
We therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which, when we do not know and when the spread of a serious disease is at stake, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, an exclusionary measure must be taken.
In April 1999, we therefore refused blood to people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than one month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proven that this disease is transmitted by blood.
So this episode showed us that sticking to the precautionary principle made sense.”
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid (NAT) tests, which make it possible to detect the presence of the virus itself in donor blood, rather than the presence of antibodies on which the tests used before were based.
NAT tests have made it possible to shorten the deaf period that occurs between the moment of infection of the patient and the moment when our techniques can detect the first viruses in the blood, explains the specialist.
We were able to shorten this period to less than a week.
We’ve significantly reduced the risk that some donors could be infected without them knowing it and without us being able to figure it out.
These improvements have made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of getting HIV-contaminated blood.
“In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will need to be distributed before someone becomes infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products every year, it will take 24 years for the first case of HIV transmission through a blood product to occur.
I believe that today we can receive or prescribe a blood transfusion necessary for healing in complete peace," said the head of the Hema-Quebec leadership.
“The challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
We never know what disease-causing elements may appear in the system.
Just last year, the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted to the blood by stinging insects.
We need to be careful all the time," Dr Décary continues, stressing that in addition to safe supplies, Hema-Quebec must also count on sufficient supplies.
“The needs are growing as the population ages.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population also has implications for the blood donor network, which on average consists of only 3% of Québecers who are eligible to donate.”
Each healthy person is at least 18 years old, meeting the criteria for admissibility, but can donate blood only once every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer blood are not accepted, because they are, for example, carriers of AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited a country where mudslides are raging, they are excluded for a year.
“With this 3%, we can maintain a state that meets the needs of hospitals.
Deficiencies are very rare.
Members of the donor network, however, need to be supplemented in proportion to how they age and can no longer donate blood.
However, it is difficult to persuade people to give blood, especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
“Life is so unrestrained today that we rarely find an hour to donate blood.” – Francine Décary
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before they are stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, previously considered a biomedical waste, abounds with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our 1,000th cord blood sample into the bank, and we expect to collect over 1,000 cord blood samples a year.
At the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplants," explains Dr. Décary, who describes the cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they do not have access to it," because Hema-Québec does not have enough funds to offer this complex and expensive program to all hospitals in Québec.
Football - Impact in the semifinals
Impact Montréal qualified for the USL First Division semi-finals yesterday at the Saputo Stadium during the second and decisive quarter-final match played for the total number of goals, thanks to a 3:1 (4:3 is the goal balance after both games) over the Seattle Sounders.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored a decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a two-way goalless first half, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the remaining two goals of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could handle Matt Jordan in favor of the Sounders.
Recall that on Friday during the first of the two matches of the quarterfinals Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
Impact will face off in the semifinals with the Whitecaps of Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder equalized the deficit 3:1 in the home game and eventually won 4:3, but Whitecaps nevertheless advanced to the semifinals with a total of 5:4 goals.
Impact is expected to face Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series of matches will not be confirmed until today.
Briefly - Kovalev's winning goal
The first attacking trio of Canadien is ready to start the season.
The unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Plekance and Andrej Kosticin encouraged the attack to the victory of Canadaien 3:2 last night at the Centre Bell.
Kostitsin, the biggest star of the clash, scored a goal, Plekanec collected two assists and Kovalev scored one pass in this fourth victory of three-color out of six preparatory matches.
Kovalev secured the victory by scoring a single goal during the separate raids.
"I'm not ready yet," said the Russian.
"I need one more game to feel good."
"He tried to do too much in the first third," said Guy Carbonneau.
“I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice applause."
Charest bet on the north
The prime minister has said he will call early elections by the end of the year.
Immediately after the Liberal Party (Parti libéral) congress, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where new Health Minister Yves Bolduc (left) is running in today's by-election.
"To push back the limits of our last great northern frontier": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually eye-catching way at the end of the congress of the Liberal Party of Québec in Levis, without giving details.
During his speech, pictures were projected behind his back in a sort of image mill.
On three huge canvases ran a loop with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, down, Québec from the point of view of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Generous resources, as in the pre-election period.
At a news conference, the prime minister refused to rule out triggering an early election in the fall, although he said he had a very busy schedule.
The “Northern Plan” forms the fourth dimension of the “vision” the Prime Minister envisions for Quebec, the vision of a “new economic space” that includes a labor agreement with France, a Canada-Europe agreement, and an agreement with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has recently often mentioned in his statements, he has never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North represents a "gift with huge potential", but did not specify a date, the amount of investment, or a clear priority in future projects.
At the most, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further developed: in particular hydropower plants, forests, but especially the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the restoration of public infrastructures.
The North, according to Charest, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds."
This "territory twice the size of France is here", "is in Québec.
And it is not only in our country, but it is in us," he stressed, as if to show that he was referring to a certain national founding myth.
Québec was built largely in relation to the North, highlighted the Prime Minister: the pursuit of gold in Abitibi, Québec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added after a theatrical pause to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70 percent of Québec territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always demanded, the prime minister said during a press conference.
"This is a traditional position that has been repeated by all governments to date.
“There is one border line that has long been non-existent, and if the opportunity arises, I will re-engage in the name of the government,” he said.
Otherwise, "in the context of climate change, it is also necessary to rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking about the North-West transition, which will open year-round due to the melting of glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that taking territory becomes a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially the young.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist MP from Ungava), have already started negotiations with about thirty communities.
The inter-ministerial committee, chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier and with an important position held by Julie Bouletová (Transport and Natural Resources), opened its work.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be set".
Indeed, the development of the North should be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North plan will be "jointly designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a fluid follow-up to the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we have changed our mindset to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
That was, after all, one of the still-shocked topics of the weekend, which was launched on Friday with a big cocktail highlighting the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s accession to the leadership of the party.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to rename the Beauharnois headquarters to the Adélard-Godbout dam.
“From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who revolutionized and nationalized hydroelectric power, to Bourass, who created James Bay, our party has been able to shape the future,” Charest said.
At the press conference, he referred to another authority, this time conservative, namely John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, which premiered from 1957 to 1963.
When it came to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam, Charest stressed that its launch is planned for 2012.
"I'm only saying this between us, but I plan to be there," he told his member base, provoking considerable applause.
The same prime minister who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and no doubt in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of calling an election in the autumn of this year, which the law allows him to do.
However, he stressed that his program is packed, especially the missions of the Federal Council in China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend convention provided the Liberal leader with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain "efforts to amend the constitution" that went very smoothly: PLQ (Liberal Party of Quebec) demands in particular recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also wishes Quebec to appoint a number of members of the Canadian Broadcasting Council who would have veto power in the event of decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition was skeptical of the Nord Plan in its main features.
PQ (Parti Québecois) boss Pauline Marois has once again pulled out the Northern Québec Development Policy launched by Landry’s government in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, she renounced the implementation of this policy.
If she had stuck to it, “we would have moved on today,” Marois said, alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in government.
"But we wish it wasn't just theatre," explained Sébastien Proulx, the leader representing Mario Dumont, who is returning from a holiday today.
Letters: The Dishonored Land
It was Vic Toews, the ex-minister of "justice" (of irony) in Harper's cabinet, who last summer allowed himself to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "shame" for Canada.
To defame a woman who has fought tirelessly for justice, and who deserves all our admiration, says a lot about the Prime Minister’s entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government that, as the only one of all the Western countries involved, has not taken back to its homeland its citizen imprisoned in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a young adolescent at the time of the alleged crimes.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and leaves a child soldier rotting in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to judge the defendant's guilt.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and in particular the Association of Canadian Lawyers advocate the repatriation of Omar Khadr, so that he can wait for a fair trial in Canada.
The same government turns a blind eye to torture: it cares little that this young man is psychologically destroyed in the future, no doubt permanently, after so many years of torture.
We don't realize it, but we are just witnessing a creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom, and our "democracy," the words that Harper bends so much and that sound so empty from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no longer any morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, mistreat him, imprison him at the discretion of the head of the so far minority government (as it will be after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that proclaims Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see this government renouncing what formed the reputation and esteem of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is in this renunciation, not elsewhere.
Opinions - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Discourse
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir printed a letter from Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwellian logic, he confirms that the world’s largest gold producer has launched a prosecution of three authors and a poor little publishing house for insulting honor with the aim of sparking a “transparent public debate” and demanding six million for them.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of prosecution for insult to honour, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, Garver misses this crucial distinction altogether.
Or is it the best way for Barrick Gold to hold a public debate, to bankrupt anyone who dares to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the outcome, the authors and publisher of Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectable sums of money to be ready to defend themselves and fight in a very unbalanced fight with an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of a mining company.
The tactic in these unbalanced battles, after all, often consists in ruining the defendants in order to enforce a conciliation procedure that will silence the opposing party and, moreover, terrify anyone who would dare to devote himself to this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have presented its view to public opinion.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada the debate under normal circumstances lies in the exchange of ideas, and not in the stabbing of a baton.
The mining companies, therefore, were not enough to open their books, their documentation, and create a real debate through newspapers, media, publications, and the funding of independent scientific teams that could bring light to the matter.
Barrick Gold, however, does not seem to have confidence in public opinion and has been quick to reject petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can demand a "public debate" and at the same time despise the views of the same public?
In the vice president’s world, the word seems to refer only to high-paying lawyers, not to all Canadians; that’s a rather narrow term.
In a democracy, even the nazis have the right to speak.
Barrick Gold does not understand – or does not want to understand – that the public, which supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada, does so primarily because they reject the brutal ways of mining society.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and judge the matter, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not in what many perceive as a prosecution in which the defendant is to be silenced (in their prosecution of the "public debate", the company Barrick, by the way, has just filed an official appeal to the authors of Noir Canada, to re-state them officially...
Aside from Garver’s surreal speech, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university’s freedom of inquiry and the search for truth, which are essential to any democratic society.
In general, it denies the right to quote credible sources and to debate the facts and interpretations that constitute the very basis of intellectual activity.
If, in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that the world’s rich companies don’t like without facing repeated prosecution, who else will be able to do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could create one if it followed the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He's entitled to an answer.
The university environment we belong to has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s exaggerated lawsuit clearly shows that, despite what it claims, it has no desire to have a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, as it is for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place measures to curb this type of unjustified prosecution.
Wall Street rescue operation: Democrats and Republicans understand each other
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
A new version of the plan to use $700 billion to contain the financial crisis that has been plaguing Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it envisages: better control of the elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms ensuring the repayment of the deposited public money, new measures to capture the amount of houses seized due to non-payment, as well as the right to monitor the level of wages paid to managers of rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news just minutes after midnight yesterday, following the conclusion of a two-day negotiation marathon.
"We've made great progress and we've reached an agreement that's going to be effective in the markets," said Henry Paulson, a senior administration official.
“Everything was done to keep the real economy and ordinary Americans safe from the crisis that is taking place on Wall Street,” he said.
"This is a critical point: if we don't, the trauma, chaos and disruption to American daily life will be enormous," Gregg said.
Over the past few hours, negotiations have begun to take a maximum turn for fear of the effect that another failure would have on investor sentiment.
The time limit was set for the markets to open this morning.
Both candidates for President of the United States were invited to the negotiations later, and both expressed rather in favor of the agreement, but did not forget to express their dissatisfaction with the fact that it was necessary to resort to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has credited the addition of an agreement on some measures, particularly one aimed at allowing homeowners to maintain their residence, and measures on the wages of state-rescued workers.
“When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is nothing to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary," he explained on television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, who was asked by another station whether he would vote for the proposed plan, replied: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
“The rough features I’ve read [show] that it’s something that we’re all going to have to go through and make it possible to move forward.
“Choose inaction is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The goal of the $700 billion plan is to buy back dubious claims and risky and unsellable assets of US financial institutions with taxpayers’ money.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis unleashed by a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgages (subprimes), then transferred to other, more widespread forms of loans (PCAAs) and resulted in a cash freeze and the breakdown of banks and financial institutions.
The collapse of the first draft of the agreement last week is the responsibility of the Republican deputies.
Since the Democrats have accepted that the government will only vouch for, but not buy, some of the “toxic” assets of troubled companies, there is a conviction that the impasse is over.
In an effort to reconcile conflicting views in Congress, a provision was added that the government would be able to introduce new fees that would help it recover its deposit if, as a result of the program, it had to take over losses for five years.
The new plan envisages the deposit of the first amount of 250 billion, to which it will be possible to add another 100 billion, if the President deems it necessary.
A further $350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will receive shares in the rescued companies, which, if profitable, will pay him dividends and which he will be able to sell again when it is all over.
The federal government will have the option of delaying the procedures for seizing real estate related to the loans covered by the plan, as well as setting limits on the amount of appraisals and compensation paid to executives of affected companies.
The drafters of the plan would like to submit it to a vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is not yet clear whether their plan will be green.
Yesterday, votes continued to rise against the project in both the Republican and Democratic camps.
"It's pretty clear that Washington can't hear you," Scott Garrett, a member of the House finance committee, said.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
Paying taxes is not a solution.”
Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, the moderator of a group of congressmen dubbed the "skeptics' committee," presents the matter differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred distinguished professors of economics, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to us: we ask Congress not to be too hasty and to examine carefully which path to take,” he said.
At the same time, it was again confirmed in Europe that this crisis is a global crisis.
Following the end of the emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after French bank BNP Paribas announced it was withdrawing from the purchase of its competitor, which has been on the verge of collapse since it lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion ($2.9 billion) as a result of the crisis of risky loans to buy real estate in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of Europe’s top 20 banks and top 10 insurers.
"We will not lose this money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos.
“In return, we gain the right to vote in a bank and influence.
And that’s what savers and households can appreciate in these uncertain times.”
On the other side of the English Channel, the British government appears to have launched a nationalisation of another bank hit by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) were loans to buy real estate.
According to its announcement yesterday, the Spanish bank Santander will buy the branches and accounts of clients of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalised by the UK government since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a Socially Engaged Icon
His beauty with azure eyes has long been his trump card, according to others a weakness.
Has this American actor emerged with a charming smile from narcissism?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivity, and unfailing talent that was his own also distanced him from the power category that begets real stars.
But what a long-distance runner he was!
Paul Newman died on Friday at the age of 83 at his Connecticut ranch from lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of the fat years of American cinema.
Less grandiose than Brando, to whom he was similar and had long been a kind of rival on the screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often gives birth to beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and his mother was Hungarian.
From these European roots, one of the famous faces of the American dream was born.
Without excessive ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because in it, the whole country looked in love with self-made mana, a fighter in the war in the Pacific, wounded in the battle, who in the early 1950s studied acting in Yale, then attended the New York Actor's Studio and celebrated triumph in theater, television and soon in film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a race car driver who placed second at the Le Mans 24-hour race in 1979, and also a sexual symbol, despite having formed a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him also go the shady places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the hype of his own show business, which will forever remain somewhat mysterious.
A decent man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman’s departure this weekend has left movie lovers dizzy, while his big roles rival each other on the black canvas of memories.
It is followed by more than half a century of the ever-changing American seventh art.
The charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Hot Roof, a 1958 Tennessee Williams adaptation, reappears in memory.
From a less distant past (1990), we recall his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in old age by a marriage that did not live up to all expectations.
So many Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, a battered, violent, unforgettable delinquent from Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, taken over after his death, which brought Newman into real prominence in 1956.
A likeable gangster in the absolutely great The Sting (Scam), Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
A bitter and vindictive pool player in Robert Rossen's The Hustler (1961), he will portray the same character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, earning him the only Oscar out of seven nominations in 1987.
This face wandering through the ages, it was him.
And he's back.
In his professional career, different eras compete with each other.
Young people know him mainly thanks to the iconic Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
Fans met him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
He ended his career as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in Sam Mendes' 2003 film Road to Perdition.
Contrary to a few film legends who left the craft fairly soon, Newman remained in the business for a long time, albeit denouncing Hollywood with its glitter, ostentatiousness, and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "a living challenge of underplaying", judging that in his performances he pushed the saw too much.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, whose roles came on a platter, the profession was not always so tender.
The first lovers, however, he played less often than the outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, scoundrels and despairers, whose decline and rebellion were reflected in his perfect features.
As a director, Newman revealed little-known aspects of his shy sensitivity.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), starring his wife Joanne Woodward, gives a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
In 1984, he dedicated the film Harry and Son to his son Scott, whom he had lost to an overdose, a work of shame and sadness.
In a wave of tributes Newman received yesterday, his great friend and former partner Robert Redford (played together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) lamented, "His presence made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of life, these are the main characteristics of the deceased actor.
Abandoning his legendary career, he also leaves a great fighter for civil rights, ecology, an independent film, an opponent of the decline of Hollywood.
We were used to seeing his image on bottles of wine vinegar, sauces, cookies and other foods, which may have seemed rather tasteless, although at first it was a gag.
However, the profits from the sale went to the account of his Foundation for Difficult Childhood.
Rather than being swayed by fame, Newman was engaged in society until the very last moment.
He left a letter to his five daughters that read: “Always and to the end, your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor to be here.”
And it was an honor for us to be able to follow the life path of such a clairvoyant and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, an exemplary citizen.
What was produced in the invoice factory Zuschlag & spol.?
Soon, on October 8, the trial in the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
The politician and his associates, among other crimes, including forgery of documents, are accused of fraud committed by a long-term and systematic criminal organization, as a result of which extremely significant damage was caused.
According to the prosecutor’s office, they used the money obtained in public tenders for their own purposes and often documented the fulfillment of tasks with fictitious invoices.
The money from the state and local governments – a total of approximately 65 million forints – went partly to the cash desk of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly to the pockets of individuals.
The method, of which the investigating authority was also informed, was that the money raised in the tenders was collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no actual consideration and the undertakings entered into by the associations were never met.
According to the prosecution, a large part of the invoices were fake.
Prints for these invoices came from the J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefváros market, round stamps were made in Kiskunhalas.
It was decided on which companies to produce invoices, among other things, on the roundabout along the northern shore of Lake Balaton, to which István Ladose János Zuschlag sent.
According to his testimony, the first named should have looked for guesthouses and restaurants.
In them, he asked for bills for his consumption, according to which the invoices submitted in the framework of public tenders issued by, among others, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, or the Municipality of the capital, were then produced.
Invoices were mostly issued by István Lados with his partner András <0xC5><0x90>rim, who, according to our information, most often wrote the reports needed to obtain subsidies.
During his "study trip" Lados looked out for a pub.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and his associates, in 2003 this catering establishment provided catering for a 90-member group from Biztos Pont.
However, according to the head of the company, so many people would not fit into this device at once.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, later Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt and Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, was riddled with formal and content errors.
The Badacsonytomaja guesthouse had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet one hundred and thirty guests were listed on the invoice.
Fillers of forms with a rich imagination, however, exaggerated this even when they mentioned on the documents a company also engaged in hospitality - Pigal s. r. o., in the accounting of which, according to the information provided to the public prosecutor's office, the documents sounding in the name of Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hoppa were not even figured.
The head of the company, Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor’s office and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that they were fake documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were stamped in the wrong place."
In addition to the formalities, he added, the fact that they have accommodated a hundred people according to the invoice did not agree, because they have only eleven rooms that do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, food was also listed on the invoice, and their restaurant has not been functioning for a long time.
The eager invoice manufacturers were also not convinced that the Budapest travel agency was organising only foreign trips, and that the invoice was paid in cash, which was also not in line with the company’s invoicing practice, they foolishly stated as a travel brokering service in Hungary.
In addition, as it turned out during the investigation, VAT was also mentioned in the document, although the organization of trips to countries outside the European Union was exempt from VAT.
Hotel Révf<0xC3><0xBC>l<0xC3><0xB6>p s. r. o. did not agree to the amount of VAT on the four documents issued to the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, among other things. The company’s activities are not covered by the mentioned 25 percent, but by the 15 percent VAT, in addition, the hotel staff issued only printed invoices, but the produced invoice was handwritten.
In addition, the "publishers" spoiled the invoice, for example, by stating to one company how it turned out, thanks to the investigation of the state prosecutor's office, that the activity of road transport of goods was carried out, which the company based on investment advice was not originally engaged in.
The fact that the invoices issued to the Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt and Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Foundations and Associations XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let and Biztos Pont are false has also been exposed due to formal deviations - the incorrect format of the invoice and the false stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3> Sports Camp, whose representatives denied that they had issued the invoices.
For example, the counterfeiters did not notice that the company HIB s. r. o. from Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyháza was in liquidation at the time (2001) when a group from the Fiatal Városért association was eating there, which is why, according to our information, the liquidation commissioner of the company also denied that he had issued the paper.
Invoices were sent consciously.
The second group of invoicers consists of those who knew that they should issue a fictitious invoice.
The Esély Budapestért Foundation has issued bills for approximately four million forints to the Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Foundation at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal organization - Ifju Szocialisták.
The head of the company Collab s. r. o. was forced to issue a fictitious bill by one of the defendants, Ludovic Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rfi, according to the indictment.
Biogate s. r. o. also cooperated with Zuschlag and its associates, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért foundation and the Atlasz and V<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>sfeny<0xC5><0x91> associations with invoices worth approximately five million forints, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Neither was the movement of money, because the invoices created were later cancelled, which, of course, organizations forgot to mention in their documents.
Another group of invoicing companies includes those that had ties to the defendants.
For example, Iván Kubatov was the authorised representative of the Ukrainian executive of Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> s. r. o., a fuel and motor vehicle trader based in Budapest, where the company is not to be found.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the information obtained by the investigation, these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment s.r.o., a Kiskunhalas company, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a man from Romania, to whom he was supposed to hand over documents related to the company in 2002-2005 also Ivan Kubatov.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that, on behalf of the company, he had issued invoices to the associations Atlasz, Hoppa and the Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt and Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Foundation, and he himself accepted their counter-value.
At the request of Ivan Kubatov, Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s.r.o. and Jos-Investment k. s. were founded by Romanian bricklayers.
In fact, none of the companies worked, according to the defendant, because they did not get a job.
Nevertheless, the companies benefited him by issuing invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations Atlasz and Y-Generáci<0xC3><0xB3> connected to Zuschlag, at the request of the co-accused lawyer Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their constituent documents.
On behalf of Investment, Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3>, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints to the organizations.
The prosecutor’s office concluded that Kubatov had come to 10 percent of the amounts indicated on the invoices and VAT.
To issue fictitious invoices, this time to tender for the association Biztos Pont, the man also used the company Szi-Beri k. t.
In January 2006, Y-Generáci<0xC3><0xB3> and Sz<0xC3><0xB6>vetség and Modern Magyarországért submitted proposals to the Mihály Táncsics Foundation (TMA), a public benefit organisation of the Socialist Party.
They received 500 thousand forints each, but did not spend the amounts on the goals listed in the proposals.
In order not to reveal this, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were also found during a house search at <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei’s office at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, some of the defendants are likely to describe the production of invoices, as they have already done at the prosecutor’s office.
It may be more interesting if the main defendant János Zuschlag decides to reveal everything himself.
His testimony to date is not very detailed, and although he has promised to explain everything in detail several times, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for paying a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, with which perhaps the socialists have made a deal and Zusi will take it upon himself.
He may have been offended, since his requests to ease the conditions of his detention, namely to be placed under house arrest, have not yet been heard.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes, who have done much more damage that they have not yet paid for, can walk freely, or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their homes, he does not have this option.
The Psychology of Trumping: Why Are We Spending More Money?
In auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overestimate the goods.
The neurological and economic underpinnings of this familiar – and seemingly irrational – behavior have been revealed to researchers in the fields of neuroscience and economics at New York University.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people do not want to lag behind in a competition like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay too high a price.
Research using an experimental auction tried to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers gambled, the second group participated in a live auction, using the method of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the active areas of the brain of experimental subjects.
In both games, the participants could win money, but when playing at an auction, the important element of which is to win the other side, the whole located under the cerebral cortex, called the striatum, began to work intensively during the loss.
This brain region plays, among many other functions, a role in the "self-reward" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the screwing-up of the price can be explained by an attempt to avoid a sharp striat reaction.
To support their theory, members of the research team from among economists conducted a financial cross-sectional survey.
Under different conditions, three groups were bidding against one partner.
The control group was simply told what the fair value of the product in question was and they made the bets.
In addition, members of the other group were promised that if they came out of the game victorious, they would receive an additional $15 as a reward.
The third group received $15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members also lost this money.
The difference between the two groups, therefore, lay in the fact that one emphasized victory and the other was a loss.
However, the members of the group playing "against losing" were willing to go higher than in the control and "winning" group, which confirms the hypothesis of neurologists.
“These results cannot be inferred from any pre-existing economic theory.
Until now, they have explained the phenomena observed in auctions of the joys of victory and the avoidance of risk.
It wasn’t until neurological imaging methods helped us resolve the contradiction between the two theories that we now came up with a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, a professor of economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed as one of the leading causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand of them are treated. The reason for this is that patients often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a collective name for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, inflammation of the liver and jaundice is characteristic, but the causative agents of the disease and the diseases caused by them differ from each other.
Depending on the causes of the disease, hepatitis viruses are spread in two main ways: hepatitis type A and E in the digestive tract (for example, infected food, water), hepatitis type B, C, D and other viruses by blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
In any case, travelers should protect themselves by vaccination against virus A and B, there is no vaccine against virus type C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after ingestion of infected food, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal discomfort, urge to vomit.
After that, jaundice, lightening of the stools and darkening of the urine will form on the skin and whites of the eyes. Treatment can take up to two to three weeks.
Every year, one million people die worldwide from a more serious type of the disease, liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that, according to estimates, only one in ten infected is treated with medication.
Also, hepatitis C can have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most infected do not even know about their disease, the causative agent of the disease destroys liver cells insidiously, and so the first symptoms appear in many cases only in 20-30 years.
Therefore, early prevention, the implementation of regular depistration is very important.
In three groups, the disease occurs much more often than average: among people who underwent blood transfusions before 1991, among drug users, and among people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated global number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since the disease can already be proven by routine laboratory examination, a person should contact his general practitioner if he notices any symptom of unknown origin.
With early detection, the disease is curable, the virus can be removed from the body to prevent infection and prevent the development of cancer.
September 30th is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing the sick worldwide.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, the causes of its occurrence and the importance of early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God, doesn't it hurt so much?
According to recent research, belief in God works as a kind of analgesic that could make it easier for Catholic martyrs to die.
Scientists from the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment to study how faith in the god of pain affects a person’s perception of pain, the British Telegraph newspaper reported.
As part of a rather bizarre survey, 12 Catholic believers and an equal number of atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while all watched a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude a large part of the pain.
Thanks to a technique that examines the human brain in detail, it turned out that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
The research is the first in a series of studies that, in addition to academics, include scientists, philosophers and theologians from various parts of the university.
Exactly the test was carried out by attaching a sparking instrument to the left hand of the test subject, which gave off electric shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to observe two paintings: Sassoferrat’s Virgin Mary from the 17th century, and Leonardo da Vinci’s Lady with the Edge, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the research hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would provoke a certain state of piety among the faithful, while da Vinci’s image was chosen because it does not differ much from the first one and gives them a calming impression.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner and during this time received 20 electric shocks in four consecutive parts, while separately watching the image with a religious or general theme.
Catholics said that looking at the Virgin Mary made them feel “safe” as if they had been “taken care of” and “calm down, peace has filled them.”
When watching a religious-themed painting, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with the help of any strongly impressive image even in atheists, only it is necessary to find the right photo.
“We would have to find an image that they will perceive very positively, from the position of mother or father,” the psychologist said.
The Anglican bishop, Tom Wright, welcomed the findings.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases will change, our personality,” Wright said.
After such great results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on the regulation of the pain of the faithful if they were shown some madonna by Leonardo or a painter of a similar caliber.
Would it mean looking at a quality Virgin Mary to achieve even better results?
You're what you share
About his tenth birthday, Google can claim that people can find him in their pocket at least as well as in the sky overhead; they know where they have been on vacation, what professional examinations they are going to and what interests them.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, that's still not enough.
However, when it comes to skeptics who parallel Orwell’s dark vision, the very essence of Web 2.0 is not clear to them.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary for Google’s founders to be able to stick to their original purpose, which was: “Let’s organize all the information in the world!”
According to an interviewee from Google, even after ten years of world-class work, the company is only at the beginning to be able to work with all the information.
When asked what would happen in five years, Schmidt said that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like “what should I do tomorrow?” or “what kind of work would actually be good for me?” – but the software would not be able to answer such seemingly simple questions until it knew enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are well aware that during the Internet search, search words are accurately captured, as well as from which IP address they were searched and to which pages those interested in the search moved.
Thanks to the Personalized Search service launched two years ago, users can, for example, keep a history of their surfing, they can look back what they were looking for and what they clicked on, thanks to which, in the long run, results are generated adapted much more directly to them - the same logic will be used in the Recommendations service, through which the system will provide us with products based on the previously mentioned and preserved preferences.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I do? – users who are afraid when they look at Google’s data monopoly ask.
In most cases, the scope of potential power represented by the company is more threatening, the counter-reaction does not cause guilt in Internet users, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all search terms are not only captured, but in justified cases can also be issued to a third party, in such legal cases the personal rights of Internet users do not protect anything.
The most well-known recent example was probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that enabled the identification of pedophiles from the Orkut community sites set up through it.
But internet users who worry about personal rights could still rest easy in May when the firm, along with electronic rights watchdog EFF, successfully proved its truth in a dispute with the FBI: Google must not be forced by any article of the constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully fought off nearly 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search terms, which it obtained with reference to the strengthening of the Children’s Protection Act adopted years ago, yet it has failed to get lists of individual users’ search items, or complete lists of websites and keywords covering a period of two months.)
The view of Google is so contradictory: it is flogged by those who are afraid to provide their personal data, because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life, by starting to use the services of Google, will be exposed to harm, and they act against it with a revolt that belongs to multinational companies with a conservative image.
In the meantime, the American geek culture and its wild offshoot, gathering enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users around it, appearing in many countries, sees it as a new generation of big business, a “corporation that is now spiking,” unlike its Microsoft rival, considered to be the conqueror of the world because of Windows, however both fight for the same goals.
This may be because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require identification code from its users and does not want them to pay money for its applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information and a package of programs seems to be much more accessible, more youthful, "cool" than the practice of the official software giant.
However, this may also be due to the fact that geeks accurately understand the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personality rights, which has brought with it one of the most inveterate keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is all about collaboration, about intentionally leaving footprints behind and using the communication channels we have available, and although their scope is different for everyone, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can keep a profile on several community sites, from Facebook to Xang, which he can easily connect with other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm application, recording the music he listens to, then he can connect all this to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, in addition to which Pic can automatically write on his blog.
In doing so, we can read about a lot of exemplary cases, of which she shines: a girlfriend in the morning, looking at a flood of photos of mutual friends, can easily figure out who her joking friend spent the evening with, or the company can fire its employee just because today on his blog he recounts his honest opinion about the top leadership: one thing is certain:
Anyone who lives an online life consists of what they show, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least avoid Google’s monopoly, has the option (starting with Scroogle, which uses Google’s search engine, but does not intentionally leave traces).
For example, a considerable number of people do not register on community sites on purpose so that they cannot be found. Google’s online applications from text editor to photo editor and news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and that do not build the highest quality profile possible for us.
Public opinion isn’t secretly expecting Google to show its teeth.
With its current value of $156 billion, the company is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising space is jeopardizing the investment of advertising agencies and services being introduced at an ever-accelerating pace are seriously unsettling the lives of not only Microsoft but also numerous other software designers.
Critical observers, however, also find counterpoints to the disturbing impression: the top management, for example, completely rejected the protests of employees after raising the fee for the company's kindergarten to twice as much, the arbitrary daily meals of employees were too expensive, according to the company's management, but all this is lost in addition to the fact that Google in 2006 decided to go ahead with their agreement.
One of the internal rules of the company is that it never advertises new services in advance, only when they can already be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the coming months and years can bend the world in new places: while some believe that Google's project aimed at scanning and archiving books and magazines is becoming so big that the company will soon have to deal with the American market.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can then serve as a good starting point for the next generation of sci-fi writers, Cory Doctorow’s famous novel “Scroogled” describes with Orwellian reminiscences a future in which one can approach a person frighteningly well only with the help of Google data.
A double murderer from Ozd helped to remove the traces of two juveniles
Two juveniles were interrogated by police in a double murder case in Ozd, helping to remove traces of the crime, a spokesman for the Borsod County High Police Directorate said on Tuesday.
Persons have confessed to the activity of which they were suspected and are currently accused of aiding and abetting a criminal offence.
Both juveniles, according to MTI, two girls, are being prosecuted at large.
Assisting in a crime is punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double murder in Ozd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into provisional custody on Sunday.
He's a suspect in a premeditated multiple homicide for profit.
During the investigation, it was revealed that a 23-year-old young man owed a 53-year-old man a larger sum.
The suspect did not want to repay his debt, so he lured his creditor last Wednesday to a business in Ozd, where he killed a man first and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man was preparing to commit the crime in advance, as evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden at the scene.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a hundred percent stake in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side, despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
As the Czech economic daily E15 writes, the offer of Poles represents the highest amount that has been offered to those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to Czech newspapers, so far the bid has been submitted by the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B<0xC3><0xB6>rse.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all interested parties, and did not rule out that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by stock market experts at 5-10 billion.
Under the shareholders’ agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold off.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25 percent, followed by <0xC4><0x8C>eská spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
In Tuesday's comments on the deepening international financial crisis, Europe's leading newspapers are already recalling "the second 9/11".
We can thank the American president for the global financial disaster, La Repubblica of Rome accuses. The president was not even able to line up his own party in support of that hastily paid bill aimed at remedying this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which was reminiscent of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, we could talk more about the second 9/11.
Also part of the Madrid press sees the culprit in Washington.
According to the newspaper El Mundo, the world economy has been brought to the brink of collapse by the lack of political leadership there.
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system is constantly growing, for which the whole world will eventually pay.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, after the vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political tool for resolving the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air at the very moment when one of the greatest changes in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, the Geneva-based daily Tages-Anzeiger points out.
Individual states can still throw a lifeline to struggling money institutions, and taxpayers can save them from bankruptcy.
However, if more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither money nor further improvisation will be enough.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union need to move beyond their national egoism and unify control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, moribund monetary institutions received more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion, according to the Vienna-based Der Standard, according to which fears that, like the Americans, European taxpayers will have to reach deep into their pockets in order to solve the crisis, are becoming increasingly real.
The European Union has not yet seriously addressed the crisis, which is like a tsunami rolling down the old continent.
Rescuers don't have to wave hundreds of billions of euros right away, but it would be good if they could determine in which case it would be wise to reach for taxpayers' money to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates bumblebee flight
What would be the best method of developing collision-preventable technologies, if not imitating obstacle detectors found in the natural world?
For example, with bees.
The initial strategic idea of the surprising project, presented at the Japanese trade fair CEATEC, was inspired by Nissan engineers bumblebees. It was about how to build a new generation of systems to prevent collisions.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has designed a biomimetic robotic control system type BR23C, a robotic mini-car that is equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that can eliminate all precipitation.
"During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is actually very similar to our safety protective packaging," explained Kazuhiro Doi, general director of the brand for technology PR and R&D.
An important role is played by compound eyes, which allow bees to see in all directions at an angle of vision of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the compound eye, engineers reached for the idea of a laser rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles up to 2 meters ahead of BR23C in a 180-degree field of view, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately turns into an operation aimed at preventing a collision.
The obstacle is captured within a fraction of a second, then the robot car begins to imitate the movements of the bee, and by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent a collision, it immediately changes direction.
Unlike any existing system, this maneuver takes place in a completely instinctive way.
“If this were not the case, a robotic car would not be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Ando, head of the Mobility and Robotic Car Project.
It must respond instinctively and immediately, as this technology suits the most vulnerable and innermost layer of safety protective packaging, within which a collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the bee is doing to avoid other bees.
This process should not take longer than a blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be turned.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to bees when avoiding, only the possibility of rotational movement, acceleration and deceleration was applied in the case of a robotic car.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion variants.
According to Ando, instinctive, intelligent response is important, not the ability to process, much less store data.
This mechanism must process and respond to only a few incoming signals per second.
It does not need to store and react using intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it constantly uses only memory of a few kilobytes.
It does not need memory with giga- or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards developing a technology for immediate avoidance that Nissan estimates could hit mass-produced cars within a decade.
Another possibility of application may be the connection of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system, which, after avoiding obstacles in the way, would lead the motorist to the given final goal.
The damned dear child already has a name
The $700 billion economic rescue package bill, which is to be split into several instalments and which aims to buy back low-quality bank loans, is already in writing.
In the first round, half of the amount will be used.
After further negotiations, which ended just after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement in a days-long debate on a $700 billion rescue package, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, who said only a draft agreement remained.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, also supported the compromise on the package.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said: “The program will work and it will be effective, but more needs to be done.”
The written form of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday at 8 p.m. Washington time (that is, on Monday at 2 a.m. Central European time), but it did not cause any special rise in the stock exchanges.
The bill, known as the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, will be put to the vote on Monday, before being voted on by the House of Representatives and then by the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and news of the deal was also welcomed at the White House.
“We are pleased with the progress that has been made this evening and greatly appreciate both parties’ efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal to spend a total of $700 billion on the purchase of substandard mortgage-backed securities.
It is now possible to spend a maximum of half of the $700 billion in the first round, so that the $250 billion will be used as soon as Congress is expected to decide on the matter on Monday, and the Treasury Department will buy mortgage-backed securities for them that are rated as substandard, and the fate of the remaining $100 billion will then depend on the president’s decision.
The program will be overseen by a special board, which will also include the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Spending the second half of the $700 billion will depend on the next decision of Congress.
The Ministry of Finance may, within the meaning of the law, apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy low-quality loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, or other "poisonous" loans.
The purchase may take place within the framework of auctions and directly, said the competent representatives of the Ministry.
The legal standard will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance provides them with a guarantee for funds constituting cause for concern, for which the company will then pay a price corresponding to the amount of the expected damage.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary funds to meet the urgent requirements of the US financial system to spend up to $700 billion, whether it is a large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance or to prevent the systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the major financial institutions.
“We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed.”
On the other hand, the heads of banks that are in trouble and are waiting for state help can count on the government cutting their severance pay – which in overseas slang is simply called a “golden parachute”.
Their payments will be limited only in certain cases, moreover, these restrictions will depend on the manner of assistance provided by the ministry.
The restriction essentially means that if the ministry purchases as part of the auction, a tax surcharge will be imposed on gold parachutes unless the fallen bank directors are sent straight to retirement.
In the case of direct purchase of substandard loans, the government will aggressively intervene in order to ensure that the money for management is not excessive.
It is necessary to add that the existing contracts on gold parachutes will not change, the restriction applies only to new contracts, which should be another incentive to participate in the program.
“This is the first time in U.S. history that there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of CEOs,” House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank said in a statement.
In addition, the State will be entitled to a shareholding in the banks participating in the programme, which will reduce the risk of taxpayers, because once the economy and the rescued bank are on their feet, they can make a profit on this transaction.
In the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal setting out how the expected losses from the financial sector can be repaid to taxpayers.
On both sides, of course, there were voices expressing doubts about the plan.
“That’s not what the American people asked us to do, that’s not what taxpayers’ dollars are going to protect,” said California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa.
His Democratic Ohio counterpart, Mary Kaptur, said the legislation was pushed by those responsible for the Wall Street crash.
Industrial prices continue to rise
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007, the Central Statistical Office said.
Export sales prices in the industry were 1.1 percent higher compared to July 2008, a year-on-year decrease of 3.9 percent.
Industrial production prices, as a cause of changes in domestic and export prices compared to the previous month, increased by 0.7 percent, year-on-year they increased by 3.2 percent.
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased only minimally compared to the previous month, by 0.1 percent.
Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sector also increased slightly, by 0.1 percent, compared to July.
The largest increase in prices occurred in August 2008 in the leather and footwear industry (2.8 percent), mainly due to the monthly increase in prices in the production of bag and saddlery products by 4.6 percent and the production of footwear by 2.5 percent, respectively.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials caused a significant monthly increase in prices in the production of chemical materials and products (1.6%).
Prices have fallen in the oil processing (1.4 per cent), electrical machinery and equipment (0.9 per cent) and - to a minimum - wood processing (0.1 per cent).
Prices in the field of paper production and publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, we measured price increases in the range of 0.2 - 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas and water production and distribution sector, which has a large weight in the domestic sales of industry, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the continuing impact of the officially established increase in gas prices taking place from 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison of domestic sales in individual sectors of the manufacturing industry, prices rose the most in the professional oil processing sector (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector, a 13.2% increase was observed, followed by a 11% increase in prices in the production of food products, beverages and tobacco products, which has a decisive weight.
Prices decreased in the textile and textile products sectors (2.5%) and in the production of electrical machinery and apparatus (0.3%).
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, the price growth rate ranged between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Overall, manufacturing prices rose by 10.2 percent last year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water generation and distribution sectors exceeded prices from the previous year by 18.7 percent.
In terms of segmentation by industry focus, domestic sales showed the highest monthly price increase (0.7%) in the physical asset sectors in August.
In the sectors producing consumer goods, prices increased by 0.3 percent, in the energy processing and downstream sectors, prices did not change compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, the largest increase in prices compared to the same month of the previous year was observed in the energy processing and downstream sectors (16.8 per cent).
In the sectors producing consumer goods, we measured a price increase of 6.8 percent, while in the case of tangible assets, prices decreased by 1.4 percent.
Export sales prices of industrial products measured in forints increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, falling by 3.9 percent in the 12-month comparison.
Our domestic currency weakened by 1.7 percent against the euro in one month, 7.1 percent against the dollar, 7.5 percent against the euro in August 2007, and 15.9 percent against the dollar.
Going to the U.S. without a visa next year?
According to Kinga G<0xC3><0xB6>ncz, there is great hope that the US-Hungarian visa-free agreement will enter into force around January 12, the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke about it in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her opinion, "almost everything now depends only on the fact that an electronic system of road permits or controls will be built over the sea in time."
At the same time, she pointed out that the new system will not include an entry permit, but tourists will have to register before leaving.
As of today, the representative of the Hungarian diplomacy continues negotiations in Washington.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the Order of Merit's star Middle Cross for the Republic of Hungary, and will hold talks with foreign policy advisers to Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of a bailout package.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates for both major U.S. parties, on Sunday pledged their support for a $700 billion government bailout package, but there are also politicians who are calling for the Treasury secretary’s resignation.
After several days of marathon talks between Congress and administration officials, it was announced early Sunday that a basic agreement had been reached on a bank rescue package.
The financial package, which aims to melt the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become a central issue in the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain agree that they are the best candidates to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, as economic issues came to the fore, Obama gained a certain advantage again, and McCain’s lead, which he secured after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin’s nomination for vice president, disappeared.
Obama expressed hope Sunday at an election rally in Detroit that the $700 billion package bill would be quickly passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contains passages on consumer protection, which he also supports.
"We must act now, responsibly (...) your places, your savings, the entire industry, the stability of the entire economy are in danger," he told a crowd of 35,000.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain's ideas about the economy obsolete.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “It’s going to be a bit of a challenge for everyone... but doing nothing is simply not the way to go.”
According to the Republican senator, the proposal includes the establishment of a commission overseeing the finance minister and a severance package for top officials, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play a significant role in the negotiations, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives would vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Overview of the German language area
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more confident - so analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiders are ready to rule Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of a left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter discusses the causes of the CSU’s dramatic defeat in his article entitled “The Bavarian Revolution Eats its Fathers.”
According to a well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian socialists have been rebuilding Bavaria for decades - and it is these modern citizens who are turning their backs on them.
The change of seasons is a problem for the whole of Christian democracy, and thus for Angela Merkel.
The debacle was not entirely surprising to the CSU, but on Saturday it ended a process that could have been expected for almost exactly ten years: the undisputed hegemony of one state party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s below the 50 percent threshold.
This was repeated three years ago in the elections to the Bundestag in 2005, that is, even in the Stoiber period so often remembered.
This is due to the modernization that the CSU has consistently carried out in this country and which is eating up its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were very wrong at the pace. Secularization, the results of education, the settlement of Germans from the east and from the north in the developing regions of Bavaria, however, could not be without consequences for the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization is associated with the growth of opportunities, which also has its visible political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more confident, more critical, more assertive.
It is also clear that in recent weeks, the CSU has moved the most away from just the classical civic classes; people in the liberal professions, businessmen, individuals with graduation and university degrees.
By this point, CSU support had shrunk below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In an article entitled "Who, with whom?", the conservative Viennese daily, the presidents of the parties are restrained on coalition issues, deals with the confused internal political situation created as a result of the Austrian elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wishes to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP shall prohibit the interference of the SP<0xC3><0x96> in its internal affairs.
BZ<0xC3><0x96> seems to be open to all negotiations, the Greens still do not want to negotiate a coalition.
The elections are over, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the leaders of the parties did not allow much insight into their cards.
SP<0xC3><0x96> President Werner Faymann confirmed his wish to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
And SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is certainly possible - it exists in some L<0xC3><0xA4>nder and in the social partnership.
The question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, as Vice-Chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he put it, the Sch<0xC3><0xBC>ssel-Molterer course was voted out for every fall.
Repetition of this direction is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is completely open in the party, these issues need to be discussed definitely within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
President BZ<0xC3><0x96> J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider again appeared open in all directions.
“To prevent a red-and-black coalition, we are prepared to take on government responsibility,” Haider said.
Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ková: We need to break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
The European Equality Summit, hosted this year by France, the current EU presidency, kicked off today in Paris.
Livia Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ková, Member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers in the expert debate, drew attention to segregation in education in her message to the plenary, because it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Romani children, and, moreover, also the most serious obstacle to their implementation.
The summit was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r <0xC5><0xA0>pidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was attended by invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European organizations for the protection of rights and civil society associations active in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of MEPs of the movement, Fidesz Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ková pointed out that in addition to the discrimination that occurs in the recruitment of labor, Roma are pushed out of the European labor market mainly due to their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have a secondary education and, due to the poor quality of primary education, only a small part of them can achieve a higher level of education."
Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ková also stressed that education as a fundamental human right has a key role in the implementation of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Romani children may mean strengthening the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to establish awareness of these connections in the widest circles - between Roma and non-Roma children.
The sooner a Romani student starts school, the greater the chance of becoming a productive member of the labour market; they contribute to the national budget through income taxes and excise taxes.
"Roma need to ensure the right to quality education and guarantee the elimination of their low-quality and separate education," Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ková said.
According to the MEP, the cohesion of the European Union is needed, with an emphasis on the goal and negotiations, in order to speed up the processes of desegregation of schools immediately, and it is primarily important to properly comply with existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations.
"It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, it is necessary to provide Romani children with the opportunities given by the democratic space, so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe," Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ková demanded.
In the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities', everyone is guaranteed the objective of the European Equality Summit, held every year since last year's meeting in Berlin, to provide a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and the elimination of discrimination, set at the level of the whole of Europe and the individual Member States.
CSU: temporary pardon
The fate of the duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the shameful election debacle, the debate on personal issues has so far been adjourned by the leaders of the Bavarian CSU.
The party’s chairman, Erwin Huber, and the country’s prime minister, G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Beckstein, can still remain in their seats, the question is how long this grace will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent loss of votes, will be decided by an extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of the highly criticized duo let themselves be heard that they will not cling to their posts with all their might.
They tried to calm the enraged members of the faction and base, who, due to the loss of the absolute majority, demanded the day after the "Bavarian tsunami" to draw personal consequences.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the height of his career, the Christian Social Union gained 60.7 percent; now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, it has gained only 43.4 percent.
In Bavaria, the CSU has been “self-governing” for 46 years, producing 18 percent of Germany’s GDP.
While conservatives continue to hold a high position in the southern federal state, which is central to the Hungarian economy, they will be forced to form a coalition in the future.
One of the first signs of the reorganization within the party is the fact that a member of a close intelligence team who will start probing negotiations on a possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP, respectively with the right-wing Free Voters group, will also be the Vice-Chairman and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered to be the possible Huber’s successor.
It is ironic that Gabriele Pauli, whose anti-Stoiber speech was used by the Huber-Beckstein duo to stage a coup d’état, then made a ruthlessly short process with an ambitious municipal policy.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In a transitional period, Stoiber will also play an active role, having so far spun the threads from the background, the former prime minister of the country and former CSU chairman called September 28 the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some derogatory remarks to the CDU, saying they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to both the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor unless the CSU, which played a significant role in the country’s 2005 success, works together to get her back on her feet.
Merkel, who has struggled to hide her disappointment with the fiasco, said the loss of CSU positions would not have a negative impact on Berlin’s grand coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: treating the wounded CSU will not be easier, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD scored 18.6 percent in Bavaria, its weakest result since 1946.
Lukashenko:opposition - 110:0
Not a single member of the opposition was elected to the Belarusian parliament on Sunday.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability prevailing in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the illegalities that occurred during the vote count.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election.
Although the country's 110-member legislature has been well short of opposition for a decade, the opposition grouped under the name of the United Democratic Forces (UDF) before yesterday's election seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who had retained a constitutional amendment in the 2006 parliamentary elections, would "renew this presidential election for the fourth time."
The ODS also dropped a previously considered boycott.
Against the background of oppositional expectations, economically dependent Belarus became more and more dependent on Russia - which took out a loan to mitigate the impact of Russia's constantly increasing gas imports and also contributed to the fact that Beltransgaz, the owner of gas pipelines passing through the country, got into the hands of Russia - wanted to improve relations with the European Union because of the European Union.
The OSCE, in its assessment of the election campaign, stressed the positive shifts and not the shortcomings - for example, the ban on the candidacy of a third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE’s flash report on Monday already had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates were virtually unable to appear in the press, especially that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
At the same time, according to the opposition, improvements can be felt in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to engage in minor confrontations with Moscow, while it continues to refuse to recognize Georgia's breakaway South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Belarus is now a two-month-old state on paper, considers this to be a union state.
"We have taken two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this remains the case, despite the fact that "a single member of the opposition was too frightened to enter the insignificant parliament".
Looking at the results of the opposition, it does not plan protest actions, but rather tries to deliver its message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print opposition papers in Russia, local authorities are putting obstacles to distribution, but I can see that more and more people, even among the elderly, are supporting the change," Milinkiewicz said, pointing out that the Lukashenko regime, which considers the creation of social security to be its greatest success, does not consider the pensioners to be the right or officially the most supported class.
"Due to the country's indebtedness and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the social security 'inducing silence of the cemetery' collapses," Milinkiewicz said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers assessed the election as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the Commonwealth of Independent States mission, told Russia’s Ria Novosti news agency that “people do not believe in words but in deeds,” so the absence of opposition is nothing but proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast before work"
It is the first time in the history of Chigi Palace that revolving doors have been introduced upon the arrival and departure of employees.
However, from today, this new measure will start to work against cunning people, against those who prick themselves and then go for coffee during working hours.
The news against lazy people was announced today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Mauro Masi.
“The revolving door,” says Brunetta, “is a tool for better work, higher performance, more presence and more services.”
“A new era of accountability and transparency is now opening up.
This is reformism," Brunetta said.
With the Chigi Palace, we will complete the implementation of the Council Presidency in all buildings.
For Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view."
There were no objections on the part of the staff, the Secretary-General assures: "It was a joint procedure with the staff and everyone's cooperation."
In short, no more breakfast during business hours; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "There's nothing better than a proper cappuccino at seven in the morning."
During one conference at the Higher Vocational School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister will finally announce that within three months, the absence of public employees for the disease has decreased by 50%, that is, by 60 thousand more people a year at work.
And he adds that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
“Its payout dynamics has doubled in the last 8-10 years relative to the private sector and is much higher than the inflation rate.”
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees gathered to reject the norms of the Brunett Decree in line with the request supported by the Codacons.
“While the Minister of Public Administration will present figures today regarding lower absenteeism due to illness,” writes the Consumer Protection Association, “the nation of ‘busy slackers’ is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct public administration employees who have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.”
Tara will protest in particular against the exclusion of sick leave allowances, which depend on the activity; the extension of the period in which it is possible to check the patient, in what time period control visits will be carried out, and against other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Occupational accidents, Napolitano: "Resolute prevention"
Every day, 2,500 work-related injuries occur in Italy, three people die and twenty-seven remain permanently disabled.
The Inail figures confirm that in 2007 there were approximately 1,200 deaths as a result of work-related injuries.
These values testify to the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
In order to reawaken the attention of institutions, social and information media on this dramatic problem, Anmil is celebrating today, in all Italian regions, the 58th National Day of Victims of Occupational Injuries, set for the second Sunday in October.
"The alarming data disseminated by Anmil and the same tragic news these days confirm the importance of the issue of occupational safety," President Giorgio Napolitano said in a report sent to President Anmil, the National Association for the Mutilated and Disabled for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his deep admiration for the constant joint efforts for safety at work, for the protection of injured workers, for assistance to the families of the victims and for the participation of public opinion.
“Naturally, an outraged ‘enough’ has been raised, sincerely shared in the face of tragedies that in their scope cause a stir in the media and the participation of public opinion, but everyday reality again offers us dramatic cases, even repeating itself in its dynamics.”
Napolitano makes no secret of the fact that "there is undoubtedly a resource problem here: it is crucial to invest in training and awareness.
Numerous initiatives in the field of education are of particular importance in order to raise awareness among young people facing the world of work.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up because of its alarming social severity, to apply and improve legislative norms.
Chamber President Gianfranco Fini, for his part, stressed "how the phenomenon of death as a result of a work accident creates an absolutely critical social state, how it offends the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort towards the necessary end of this state."
"As for the data on work-related injuries, they seem to show a certain positive turnaround, but this does not deny that the number of deaths as a result of work-related injuries is alarming in any case," President Anmilu Pietro Mercandelli said.
"We would not want this 'effort to reduce' to lead to less attention, because the moment the attention stops, tragedy breaks out.
“We believe that there is generally still too little being done to stop the problem of injuries, and there are many activities that can have an impact on this problem.
It is necessary, in our opinion, to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the area of training of workers, right from school age."
"There is still a need for further efforts," he added, "in terms of communication and participation of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon which constitutes an exceptional social phenomenon is needed.
Mercandelli finally declared that this was a progressive degeneration of the levels of the right to compensation assumed for working victims and the “displacement of supportive care” that the system has been coming to in recent years.
“The aim is therefore to give back to the worker the guarantee of insurance,” he added, “because the fate of those who harm themselves must not depend on spontaneity or gifting from time to time by the legislator.”
Mp3 Players Accused, Expose Hearing Risk
Listening to loud music for an extended period of time and using portable music devices as an MP3 player can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to a notice published today by the European Commission, which in an official report extended in Brussels quotes the opinion of the Committee on Science on health risks that have recently emerged and have been identified (Csrseri) by the EU.
“From this scientific opinion – we read in the notes – it follows that 5-10% of those who for at least five years listen to music using portable musical instruments, weekly for more than an hour a day and keep the device at a high volume, risk permanent hearing loss.”
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people, who often use portable musical instruments and mobile phones at high acoustic levels, can unknowingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way,” admits Meglena Kuneva.
“From the scientific findings,” the leader continues, “there is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
The most important thing is that we need to stimulate consumers and make this information public.
We must continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding to make them fully effective and to keep pace with new technology.”
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to investigate the problem, given the high use of portable musical instruments and the increasing number of young people exposed to noise of this origin.
"Scientists confirm that concerns need to be raised and the European Commission will now examine, together with the other Members and the parties that raised the issue, what measures could possibly be put in place to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise caused by portable musical instruments and similar devices."
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but there are growing concerns about hearing damage that can be caused by excessive exposure to similar forms of noise.
It is possible to greatly reduce these damages by looking for solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the Eu Scientific Committee states that users of portable musical instruments, when using loud music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, will exceed the currently applicable limits corresponding to the maximum permitted noise in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for an extended period of time risk permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem should concern 5-10% of users of such devices, and their number can be estimated between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno will leave the Commission for the future of the capital free
Today we will start, in March we will close, in June we will have sums.
Such is the calendar given by Campidoglio to the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the Caracas Spa.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the commission will compile manuals for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of Campidoglio and his councilor Gianni Alemann.
"The Commission is completely independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas - Alemanno wants to stress - It will have to secure proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by political arbitrators, who remain the Giunta e Municipal Council.
It is not an exchange of functions, but only an effort to have some place where to work out a great project for Rome.
In March, the works will be completed and then dissolved, because this institution must have an exact time limit.
In June, we will present a strategic plan and take advantage of the work done by the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome."
To the person who accuses the Commission of being useless because its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno will say: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of their proposals.
If they are as good as the Attali Commission's proposals, and I am sure of that in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
All too often, politics is watered down by the day-to-day problems and the urgency that comes up from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wants to emphasise that "this Commission is neither a useless undertaking nor a bluff: it is completely free, Roman citizens will not be worth the euro and will serve to reflect on and involve the best intelligence that the capital has".
For Alemann, in essence, “one must have a strategic outline as a starting point, neither definitive nor immobile, in order to allow our city an authentic ascension to the level it desperately needs, and to think with a united spirit about its future.”
The future, which, the mayor of Rome specifies, "will not be limited only to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further" not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as the capital, but "also include the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. We already know why
One well-known American president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who by his decisions decimated the US economy and maintained relations (as well as today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks against Obama are on the rise just as the election date approaches.
A woman in Miami wrote on her website: “This man is full of ambition.
But Obama has the audacity to think that he will rise to the highest office of a nation that had only two governors and five black senators!”
In fact, these attacks don’t say much”; they are clearly racial attacks and don’t answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then we have polls; they all say Obama will win and with a big lead.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not according to the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the South of the United States, wrote a comment: “At least once in the booth we know well to whom the American patriot will give his vote.
One side of the American mentality will come to the fore, which has remained entrenched until the last moment.
Say what you want, we’ll take care of it ourselves in the end, whether it’s Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear: if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
Despite all these considerations for the Democrats, however, the main weapon is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people: what mistakes did Bush make during his term? Eighty-nine percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home with kicks in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers died, and the Americans were not forced to pack up.
And yet Iraq has become Bush’s weakness for most.
Who will take the place of George W will have to perform a huge task.
The economic collapse of the United States was also felt by journalists: there is a period of investigation in the newspaper, and many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
The PEW Research Center asked five hundred journalists about the state of their profession and their assumptions about the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, the respondents did not openly say that they have less concerns about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem is money for American journalists, the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
Besides, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put the newspapers together, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists interviewed, this is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional journalism, as understood by the general public, to fundamentally change.
There is a clear but complex pessimism permeating the American journalist.
Six out of ten newspaper journalists and executive seniors are convinced that journalism on a national scale is going the wrong way.
In the local area, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against the broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the website is going.
Larger publishers are making their way to the Internet, which many see as the “killer” of print media.
The “economic pressure” reported by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
Five hundred journalists admitted to using the technology in the hope that it would “do something good” for their journalism.
The biggest divide in American journalism is between those who run the newsrooms—that is, the leaders—and the reporters who work for them.
56% of leaders at the national level are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the value drops to 23%.
This has something to do with job security for someone.
Leaders who think they will lose their jobs within three years are 47% nationally.
As far as journalists are concerned, they are at 30%.
When it comes to "certain work" regarding staff (our editors, etc.) in America, it is still on the order of the day.
Only 13% of journalists work on the contract.
In a nation as vast as the United States, with three hundred million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, television, and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, so it’s a question of taking it or leaving it.
Managers almost always receive huge salaries, and the editor can earn as much as ten thousand dollars a month outside the payment of pensions and insurance.
As for holidays, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year, up to fifteen days after a certain number of years.
However, American journalists, according to their own confession, often get sick within a year.
It is just a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT OF JUSTICE IN ROME, DANILO COPPOLA TO BE APPROVED IN GROTAFERRATA
The president of Rome’s second criminal chamber, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the filing of real estate entrepreneur Daniel Coppola, who has asked to move from his town, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in connection with a counter-offer in the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During his own-account trial last week, he was released from house arrest, which was converted into a forced permanent residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked that the real estate entrepreneur could change his place of residence from a rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this transfer (against which pm expressed itself) would allow him to influence his company and get to the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in Danger
This phenomenon manifested itself a few days ago, when the House of Representatives voted against the $700 billion rescue plan presented by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis is dividing the Republican party, increasingly divided between its old soul, the East Coast, a milder, accommodating federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, which, on the contrary, is conservative, hostile to “those from Washington” and, above all, to the world of finance.
The soul that arrogantly expressed itself in the vote I spoke of at the beginning.
But this is just an example of the changes, the big changes, that the current economic earthquake is already showing: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and maybe not just here.
Both in the US and in Europe, this crisis seems to act as an accelerator of phenomena that have been incubated for a long time, which are solidifying in the new climate and finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival of the market, the double category of the Power-State in relation to a certain re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking and financial institutions, which, of course, have strong ties abroad, but in which the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state, are primarily included.
At the same time, this has created a political problem for those who run it: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis appears to be economic world-wide, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationality seems to be largely out of the question or has little to add: the European Union, which is divided, as always, between different interests and different state strategies, and which is unable to decide on a single common political line, has given obvious proof.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each individual state, rescue plans, market recovery, new rules and, most importantly, the distribution of funds: at the moment when we get into distress, only the states have the economic means, the amount of financial resources, to be able to try to put everything in order.
It also possesses the necessary means and powers to use them: two sources of immense value, under certain circumstances, which perhaps no market and no international organization will ever be able to dispose of to a similar extent.
This new emphases, which the crisis places on the state-national element, is, after all, in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance which the recent economic progress attempts to attribute to one factor closely connected with it: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the kingdom satiated, increasingly sophisticated technology, immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to rule the world, all of a sudden we realized that our future, on the contrary, would have to deal more and more with such little intangible things as water, grain.
All things, who would say it, can be transported from one place on earth to another, but they are in any case connected, absolutely, to a limited space, territory.
So, whoever becomes their ruler certainly has many more cards up his sleeve than those who are not, and who have the misfortune of living in a place without grain, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty, which, however, predicts a breakthrough.
Whoever speaks of territory, state, government, inevitably speaks of politics, that is, of leadership.
Taking into account the economic crisis, two convergent phenomena appear to be forming.
On the one hand, the realization that there is an objective need for authoritarian leadership, a request for someone who could take the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discrediting of existing leaderships, especially economic ones, which turned out to be equally unsatisfactory and full of dark places.
And together, something even more profound and, in a sense, unsettling: the discredit, the impatience, the sense of incompetence and absence that is trying to dominate the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
For it seems that convictions are spreading more and more among the broad masses of the population than that their actions should be the same as the ideas of the hitherto popular elite, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite has already outlived its time and is indifferent to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership may simply be feeding a branch out of the underworld, but the strong movement for the removal of the ruling classes and the traditional political order is manifested in sudden electoral "revolts" or in unexpected changes in collective moods in the last and most recent time, from the conservative rise of the Great Congress in Great Britain to the rise of the Great Patriotic War in Great Britain.
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, one would say their format, have growing problems to understand, that is, to represent, which, not from today, is being created in the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is strengthening again, growing, potentially too large.
Before that, it would be an exaggeration to speak of a permanent “mass revolt.”
But we certainly can’t say that it means having your eyes open.
Super glue to walk on the walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walk on the walls as Spiderman.
This is an object of various American research centers, and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
Scientists have managed to keep a 100-kilogram body glued to a vertical wall with a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, which was invented by a team of researchers, is the development of materials already in existence that use a special carbon structure called carbon dwarf tubes.
“The glue base can be imagined as a series of tubes laid out like an ordered pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the legs of the gecko, covered with microscopic hairs that allow the animal to ensure perfect adhesion.
Tests carried out on various materials such as glass, Teflon and glass paper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "simply peels off the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's Faculty of Engineering.
-"This material could be useful as a temporary glue" adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk on walls like Spiderman? Perhaps, but researchers are thinking of a far less fascinating use as a connection of electrical appliances, because dwarf carbon pipes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
So far, no superheroes.
FURTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkeley, California, is also researching a new adhesive.
In an article in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, Californian scientists introduced a microfiber-formed adhesive like hair that cleans itself from dust by moving it over a surface to still maintain a perfect fit.
Medications: never with juices
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed mainly in the summer because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving drugs, their ingestion changes the gain or decrease in effectiveness with serious health consequences.
To highlight the health risks of juices, both ready-made and fresh, in combination with the use of certain medications, David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, is raising a new alarm at the 263rd National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia: one glass of the medicine is enough to reduce the risk of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
Grapefruit juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing to toxic levels the effects of certain antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological drugs.
RISK MEDICINAL PRODUCTS – This was announced by the Italian Medical Agency itself in an information bulletin two years ago, and it incited doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers of this mixture and to be careful about what they drink when they take medicines, such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that suppress the drugs.
A long list of effects damped by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the challenge of Michele Carruba, Director of the Pharmacology Department of the State University of Milan: "Such discoveries are usually immediately reported to various international and national pharmaceutical agencies, which eventually arrange and exchange information instructions for medicines.
So always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines you get, and if you come across anything unclear, do not worry, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification,” the expert for the Ansa agency stressed.
the Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to Paul Krugman for his studies of commercial models and localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old New Kenyan who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics of the Bush administration’s foreign, economic, and political actions.
A few months after the September 2001 assassinations, in the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman predicted in a New York Times op-ed that the second event would be, in terms of implications for the history of the United States, much more important than the first.
A prediction that caused quite a bit of controversy and that had been blamed on him for years, but which turned out to be accurate.
“I am surprised and shocked at the speed at which collapses like Enron and Worldcom have disappeared from the public eye,” Krugman said in a statement.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Central European Bank’s Executive Committee, Krugman is an “economy of great importance” but also a popularizer who has a “very aggressive style, especially critical of the excesses of the Bush liberal administration.”
Open Office, we have the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package.
It’s the day of the release of Open Office.org 3.0, an open source personal production package that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the more familiar Microsoft Office.
After about a year of work by volunteers, controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office will be presented to the general public with various novelties: the welcome screen and the revised and improved opening window will be supplemented with other, much more substantial ones, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest version.
The emphasis is also placed on cooperation with the Office 2007 package, Open Office is able to open the document with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models, such as what allows you to reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the ability to transfer a PDF file to a graphic design model and preserve the original appearance of the page.
From this point of view, we can still create "PDF hybrids" documents that are similar to typical Adobe graphics and have the properties of a spreadsheet or text program.
Collaboration is an element that has received many improvements within application programs: in excel, it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in the text program, each co-worker is assigned one color to comments, so that there is a clearer identification in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working on transferring some of the features of Open Office to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should present a definitive result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, it was added to the English version, which is located on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
Also, the installation cd can be sent home or to the workplace on request.
And if the topic of freelancing can be a drag to expand in homes, it is on the business area of Open Office that the package relies a lot, and can already count on a variety of projects implemented in public administration and in schools.
And there is also a range of training, consulting and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized businesses, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress for Powerpoint-like presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, in the end, is a graphical model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is possible that this estimated number can be overcome.
Kohl's results are also positive, this is the fourth case of doping
A new positive case at the last Tour de France: it is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third-ranked and winner of the best mountaineer t-shirt.
The newspaper L'Equipe quoted the report.
26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer positive for Cera, Epo third generation, after Italian Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl’s blood samples belong to those carried out in recent weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabra laboratories.
If the control analysis confirms the positive for Cera, the Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and will have to face two years of disqualification.
The report on Kohl’s positive third-generation Epo was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, the head of the French anti-doping agency, who told the Associated Press that he had already informed the Austrian government about the result.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, and also received a polka-dot shirt of the best mountaineer.
Immigrants: The New York Times is complaining, is Italy racist?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has only in the last house turned into a priority target of immigrants" received with resistance.
Does it turn a beautiful country into a nation of racists? That’s how the New York Times, a long-running article devoted to the debate on racism in Italy, began with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the “Northern Paradox”: the northern areas are also where “more integration and more work” is registered, but also “the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the strongest support for the Northern League.”
To confirm rising tensions between Italians and immigrants, the NYT cites cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturna.
Not only that.
The new legislation demanded by the Lega, which seeks to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is also cited as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
The trend highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: “Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting with Benedetto XVI in Quirinale, asked that the state and the Church work together to defeat racism.”
Students victims of expensive rentals - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students is not aware of the crisis.
According to the latest research by Sunia, a department for tenants, renting a single room can cost a student in Milan up to 900 euros, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
“The phenomenon has already reached such proportions that entire layers of students have lost the right to study due to the overall too high prices that their families would have to bear,” explains Laura Mariani, head of the Sunia Study Office, “in this city, high demand from students has distorted the market in such a way that it has triggered a process of price increases that has been increasing even for residents.”
In most cases, rental offers contain several offenses: contracts in a free manner, unregistered, without limited rent, and associated sublease.
An exceptional intervention is needed for Sunji, which could regulate prices thanks to the tax revision.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, about 450 euros are needed for one bed, for a single room it is paid from a minimum price of 650 (the Bande Nere zone) through an average value of 800 (the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zones) to a maximum of 900 (the Vittoria zone).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in zones close to the university, they need 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single room.
In Rome in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros per single room, 450 bed in double.
Values are slightly lower (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>550 per single) in zones close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
We save only if we move to the peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 for a single room in the zones of Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples, a bed costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300/450, a room from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>600, with the highest prices in the Policlinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari, they want 250/350 euros for a bed, at least 350 euros for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are certainly lower, but they have a greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities like Perugia, where the most common phenomenon is rent for students from countries outside the European Union, one more anomaly is finally recorded: an increase of about 25-30% of the fee they want for foreign students, compared to Italian ones.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso, the city cancels the historic halls
Cinematographic historical halls are closing in favor of Multiplex.
“A city without cinemas is like a blind man, like a face without eyes.”
The film, offered by director Giuseppe Tornator, successfully documents what is happening in large Italian urban centers, as well as in rural towns.
The process of restricting cinemas, the birth of large multi-halls in the suburbs and the subsequent disappearance of mono-halls in the central zones of cities, is one of the events that seem inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the hallmarks of a true cultural crime.
“It’s like losing a friend, a friend, with whom we shared a bit of a journey and a lot of emotions,” says New Cinema director Paradiso, a film that won the Tornator an Oscar and a grand jury prize 20 years ago because of a film that lost its way in Cannes.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years, the doors of 316 cinemas of the traditional type have closed, and the highest bill was paid mainly by the halls in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 less in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by closures is Emilia-Romagna, with the loss of 82 cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And proof that the first responsible for their disappearance is the emergence of the multiplex is precisely these three Italian regions, which have registered the highest number of new cinema multi-rooms: 195 more canvases in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian approach has evolved irrationally,” says Paolo Protti, president of Anecu, “it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that the existing ones will survive, because when one cinema in the city closes, not all its visitors are willing to move to a multiplex.
Then let us not even talk about the insufficient subsidy to the fund for the benefit of the operators: the previous national debt is about 10 million euros.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
Between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16 million and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>18 million per year would be needed to support the sector.”
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to be concerned with closures and which decided to find a way out by signing a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in historical centers and in the suburbs.
Among the planned standards are tax relief steps for the benefit of operators and benefits for the audience in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the zone with limited traffic and will have special prices to stop and in some parking lots.
“I like this initiative,” says Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna’s example by introducing other measures.”
However, it is certain that in order to stand against the great power of the multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a topic that has always been important: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to establish the "New Paradiso Cinema", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk in front of the already closed Rialto or Quirinale in the street Nazionale, where I shared so many emotions that I did not have to look at the inscriptions blackened with dust, I turn to the other side.”
Connection between the politician and the mafia group 'ndrangheta, the mayor Gioie Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adjust the municipal elections according to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group."
The charges brought by the Anti-Mafia Directorate in Calabria against Mayor and Vice-Mayor Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone and Mayor Rosarno Carlo Martelli, imprisoned this morning for their external cooperation with the mafia organization, are grave.
Also in handcuffs are Gioacchino Piromalli, an old middleman between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, a lawyer, a namesake of the boss, already accused of committing mafia-type crimes, sentenced to 10 million euros in damages.
“They ignored all legal and moral norms, as well as common sense,” state prosecutors wrote, when two local authorities expressed their willingness to pay for consultations with lawyer Piromalli.
“This would allow the mafia group,” the judges write, “to officially enter the city’s offices and facilitate the already vast possibilities of control and management of the public administration.”
President of the Calabrian Regional Commission Agazio Loiero does not hide that "there are many secret agreements between local institutions and the organized criminal underworld in his region: "There are areas where the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others, where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of the ‘ndrangheta,’ heroes who are still unsullied.”
The arrests this morning follow an incarceration in July last year, by which police showed that the Piromalli mafia group had received the final hit.
Since the end of April last year - the city council of Gioii Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, the reason was also the then assumed connection between organized crime and local government - local politicians were deprived of functions in the municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, chairman of the Christian Democrats, who at the time of the dissolution was elected head of the center-right coalition after a narrow election in May.
He was screaming about the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called then-Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minniti to account and accused him of having designed everything for political reasons, but judges in a prison order signed this morning explain that the mafia group has even gone so far as to ask for a change to the A3 motorway project.
Other interrogations ordered against Dal Torrion, the public prosecutors wrote, showed "the willingness to shift the demands of the businessman, the representative of some larger group very close, as is generally known, to Piromalli and to adapt the public administration elections to the interests of the mafia group."
When energy is born from the waves, the big ones come into play.
It is an infinite deposit that covers more than 70% of the Earth’s surface and is now being discovered by the world’s major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, tides are new sources of inexhaustible energy, on which the eyes of giants such as Chevron, which is now trying to lay hands on these sources, cling.
The ability to generate energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for more than a hundred years, and in the 1970s, in connection with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil went down around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went away. But now environmental organizations and a new increase in the price of oil gave the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 stated that approximately 15 percent of the world’s electricity consumption could be covered by the use of the motion of the waves of the seas.
This amount would be twice the amount of energy currently produced in nuclear power plants.
In addition, there are currents and tides.
The Giants are attacking.
The company that bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 agreed to build facilities in northern Portugal.
When this plan was announced, it looked like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, more and more companies are betting on marine energy rather than traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies,” said a spokesman for a company connected to the United States oil giant, in the Wall Street Journal, “and they’re thinking about working with us.”
The cooperation we are considering concerns obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary for the launch of a marine energy project in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially when we consider that it is in Alaska that the US continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush came up with a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are tracking the trace of marine energy, and the sums invested so far, although not known in detail, show an increasing interest, according to observers.
The technology that needs to be developed.
Experts talk about the technology, which is still in its infancy, because it is not known what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
So far, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small in size and do not appear to be causing major ecosystem problems.
However, for greater energy production, it is necessary to use technologies with a greater impact on the environment.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys that are interconnected.
The force of the waves, which moves with the buoys up and down, is changed with the help of cylinders and cylinders to the hydraulic pressure inside these buoys.
The pressure spins the turbine, which supplies energy to the generator.
The energy gets to the shore by submarine cables.
For now, there are four facilities of this type in the project phase, which are only waiting for federal approval, and part of the energy could be used for military purposes.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, is already generating power for the shopping center and parking lot using six offshore turbines in New York’s East River.
The movement of water during the tide causes the turbines to rotate, which feed the generator with this rotating motion.
Verdant said they have a long list of clients who are waiting for the necessary authorization to use this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the tide.
Of particular interest at this point is the potential for tides, say the Institute for Electricity Research.
Although it is an incoherent factor, tides are more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
States such as New York, Maine and Alaska, along with other coastal states, have already invested $7 and a half million in 2008 and have forecast investments of up to $35 million for 2009.
