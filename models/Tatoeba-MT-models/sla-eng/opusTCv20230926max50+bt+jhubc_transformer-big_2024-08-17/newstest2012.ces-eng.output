The Parliament did not support the amendment liberating Tymoshenko
Ukraine’s parliament has rejected a proposal to repeal a section of the criminal code that convicted opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment, which would pave the way for the release of the imprisoned ex-prime minister, was rejected by MEPs at the second reading of the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for concluding an allegedly unfavourable contract with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not final, and the appeal is due to be heard by the court in December.
Tymoshenko calls the verdict a political revenge of the regime, and suspicions of court bias have sparked a trial in the West as well.
The motion to remove from the Criminal Code section 365, on the basis of which the ex-prime minister was convicted, was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
It needed 226 votes to pass.
The Libyan Victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, has already been defeated.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert, and without him is after the war.
It remains to define the winner.
As is customary in the region, Islamists will win the elections, but the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council has applied to the customary law of sharia and we already have some idea of it.
Libya will become a crime-free country, for theft is a sham.
Women can forget about emancipation, potential apostates from the faith will be executed and so on.
Instead of a dictator, a society consisting of rival tribes will unify the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and that we would certainly not want.
But our way of life is neither one nor objectively the best, and it would probably not suit the Libyans mentioned above for a change.
In fact, it is strange that Islamic fighters have taken the help of unbelieving dogs.
The only thing that excuses them is that, from their point of view, NATO air strikes were not directed by a general from America, but by Allah, whose greatness they celebrated in every successful intervention.
So when you look for winners in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We took part in a shootout, we served Islam, and our politicians, in the person of a dictator, got rid of a political ally without guaranteeing any profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not occupying Libya militarily.
This eliminates the problem of the locals expelling the "crusaders".
But will they have Libya’s black gold for a mouthful of oil companies without occupation?
They may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to boast of selfless protection of human rights.
So long as it doesn't interfere with the sharia law.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe are on the lookout for investors
On Tuesday, a statistical storm swept across Europe.
Individual countries have published GDP figures for 3Q.
The Czech economy has stagnated inter-quarterly, Germany and France are growing.
The stock market is currently breaking records.
Investors are no longer looking only at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have published preliminary estimates of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by the expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted data for the second quarter, in which Germany did better than expected (an increase of 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), but France said that it appeared in a slight decline of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated between quarters, confirming the trend of a gradual slowdown in economic growth, according to the <0xC4><0x8C>S<0xC3><0x9A>.
The results are worse than analysts' estimates.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated quarterly.
The German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter, according to preliminary and seasonally adjusted data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2 percent between July and September against the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy shrank 5.2 percent year-on-year.
The yield on its 10-year bonds is 28.45 percent.
Italian and Spanish bond yields are rising to critical levels.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc. are also starting to experience problems...
The yield on Czech 10-year bonds is below 4%, although the situation in the region is worsening.
Germany has said the ECB should be the lender of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for the Euros.
In Montenegro, they won 1:0 and celebrate the 200 million advance
The football team managed the most difficult task of the season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the great Czech and the beautiful goal of Petr Jirá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, she won 1: 0.
Czech football, even with a large portion of luck in the second half, defended a luxury lead from home retaliation and will not be missing again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the progress of the match in a detailed reportage.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a large portion of happiness in the second.
The Czech national team, thanks to the home defeat in the final, the great Czech and hero Jirá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, won 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrates the progress to the European Championship.
The Montenegrins did not come under pressure until the second half due to the precise defense of the Czech team.
The losers of the match were Damjanovi<0xC4><0x8D> and Vu<0xC4><0x8D>ini<0xC4><0x8D>, who burned two big chances.
Even thanks to the great Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, in addition, a reward of about CZK 200 million will come to the cashier of domestic football.
A lot of football has been played since the first few minutes.
Both teams found it difficult to get involved in the combination and were mostly played around the mid-line.
The pressure of domestic football players did not come in the first half, because the long trenches for defense the Czech defense precisely repelled.
Iranian students are prepared to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a shield.
Several hundred college students have created a human shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
With their gesture, they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
The students prayed in front of the building at noon on Tuesday and then chanted the death of the US and Israel.
Several hundred students from universities in Iran's Isfahan created a live shield around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center, where uranium is processed, on Tuesday.
They show that they are ready to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a recent report that Iran appears to have continued its pursuit of a nuclear weapon.
A possible attack on Iran's nuclear facilities is being discussed in Israel.
Students prayed at noon before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility and then chanted death to America and Israel.
In the event of an attack designed to cripple Iran’s nuclear program as much as possible, according to the Israeli press, in addition to the Isfahan center, the Natanz facility, where uranium is enriched, would also be targeted.
The menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner sausages
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with being overweight, with 9% of schoolchildren being overweight and 5% of children being obese.
Obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, according to a recent survey.
Once again, it shows how important the environment in which a person grows up and the patterns with which he is surrounded is for the healthy development of the person.
For example, cold cuts appear on the tables of obese children up to half more often than in families of children with normal weight.
Fried French fries had for dinner the day before the research associated with the awareness event called Obesity is not a coincidence more than 19 percent of obese.
It is also not the custom for fat families to play sports, but this applies to most families of today's schoolchildren - only 15% of children answered that their parents find time for active movement at least once a week.
A survey of 900 children
The survey took place at the end of last year's school year and was attended by almost 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was the second year of the Obesity is Not a Coincidence event, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand schoolchildren from 4th to 8th grades have participated in the project.
Proper nutrition and sufficient exercise in the family is one of the determining factors, which causes a dramatically increasing number of children who are overweight or even obese.
“Only half of the respondents, for example, said that they eat five times a day in the mode of breakfast-breakfast-lunch-lunch-dinner, which is one of the basic prerequisites for proper nutrition,” reads one of the results of the survey.
Without breakfast and evening sausage
Experts point out that for a healthy development are essential and relative details, which include the regular time of family breakfasts.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst was the finding that a tenth of households do not eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in families of obese children, unhealthy fries are consumed much more often.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 percent).
Although more than 40 percent of children regularly participate in sports, the result for their parents was less than half - 15 percent.
Set up your own diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to build their own menu according to their own taste and opinion.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
Among their favorite dishes are a lot of floury, meaty and sweet dishes.
"The great popularity of sweet lemonades is particularly alarming," the survey's final report said.
For lunch, the main meal was won by pasta just above poultry.
But the children practically did not want legumes at all, and the popularity of fish and midday vegetable dishes is also low.
Incline to health
At the same time, the survey showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they get the right information.
"In the control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the end of the lecture Obesity is not a coincidence, in many cases there was a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition," the project's results say.
It was striking, for example, in sweet lemonades, where more children would start to prefer ordinary water.
Children were also much more likely to cross out poultry and fish as the main meal of the day and limit sweet foods and dumplings.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, say pros
In the introductory article about how stylists learn, I complained so much that there was a lot of it already in the introductory lessons.
I had no idea what was going to happen next.
Lectures by three professionals from the field, dressing of problematic characters and a seminar on how to go on stage.
And it's gonna get worse.
The closer to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, it is really “stunned”.
This time, Director Alenka and I discussed (there is not a single boy in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly symmetrical figure.
Such are the vast majority.
Someone has a short neck, someone has a boyish figure without proper curves, and someone is overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders, lengthen the neck or deliver the necessary curves.
We were given tips for a woman like Jennifer Lopez, i.e. bigger breasts and hips and a narrow waist, to emphasize the figure nicely and at the same time not to dress the woman too provocatively.
For example, if the difference between the waist and the hips is such that the skirt or pants really do not fit, then it is worth having at least one such piece made to measure.
You will definitely not regret it, because perfectly fitting clothes are priceless.
You will feel much better in a tailored skirt than in one that constantly moves, folds, reclines at the waist and the like.
The boy’s character can afford to wear clothes with lashes, applications, embroidery or picking.
Of course, there are a lot of such information and types of characters, so I am glad that I have a whole week to sort all the information in my head.
And I'm still afraid that, given the homework assignment, it's too much.
Each of the students received an assigned celebrity, with whom she has to come up with two outfits: day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, fashion style of the person and the type of figure.
I'll "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaigns.
In the spirit of exultation, for me personally definitely better than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently gained perhaps a hundred pounds (please take into account the exaggeration), or young Selena Gomez.
Clothes must be cut from magazines or searched on the Internet and printed and then graphically processed.
Moodboard, as the whole result is called, will then express our personal style and relationship to graphic design.
Thinking about the graphic side of styling is also important.
The stylist does not only wear physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for a specific task, for example, trendy handbags, coats, etc.).
This was told to us by the stylist and designer Mario Kamen<0xC3><0xAD>k.
But not until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
Saturday’s lecture was packed with information about the types of characters and was enriched by three guests from the industry.
Stylist Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to use it.
And a skillful stylist can work with one piece of clothing differently.
Variability is key in this case.
For example, such a trench coat (or if you originally want trenchcoat) can be worn classically over jeans and a T-shirt as a cloak, but you can also wear it on a bare body, put on a boat and take a picture as a dress.
Or just roll up your sleeves or collars and the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he said.
But what I appreciated the most was the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly for the job."
"Then you can start breaking them," Jacob said.
Finally, I understand why we are crushing all the lessons, what to combine with, why, why, when we sometimes see something different in fashion magazines.
Not to mention the shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that the stylist must have prepared many more variants of clothes than how many can be photographed.
So for a fashion story that will have ten pages (i.e. ten outfits), I have to be ready to "set up" at least fifteen.
And also that in the photo the clothes look and work in combination with other pieces sometimes completely different than in reality.
This is what we need to consider when designing an outfit.
That image and style sometimes makes up half the success was confirmed to us by Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly a miracle singer, but her image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to using the services of stylists is rather cold.
Even familiar faces sometimes consider it useless (it is enough that I know something, the way I look at it is secondary).
And if someone already lets us create styling, then we should count on the fact that they will most likely dictate a completely different (smaller) size than they really have.
Then you have to google and find out if the tabloid did not write about the fact that the celebrity has lost weight and so on.
Honza and Mario on Sunday put on our hearts that the stylist is not enough to orientate in fashion and know how to put together an outfit.
In his work, he primarily communicates with the people he dresses, so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to judge people, not to encourage yourself, to stand up for your opinion.
"When a manager orders you to sort out her wardrobe and fill it with nice pieces, you can't throw out the whole closet and say, 'Oh, my God, that's terrible.'"
"Find at least a few things to praise and recommend what you can wear," Mario says.
He also specifically showed us what all must contain the so-called "placement", or bag on the site.
It is the one that you turn on around your waist and you have all the necessary proprieties with you.
In addition to bright things such as scissors, a hair roller or closing pins, there is also a nylon thread (with it the stylist helps when photographing products such as handbags or hats), special clips to fasten the back of the clothes, if it is larger (pin or other clamp is not allowed), the ponytail would be removed.
In order not only to listen, but also to practically try something, we learned how to properly fit shoes.
Even when shooting in a studio where there is a flat surface, the sole could be damaged, let alone outside.
And so we bonded and bonded.
We must not touch our shoes with scissors, so that they do not accidentally get damaged.
It really does require skill.
Mario pleased me when my creation without reservations praised.
This skill is not really my friend.
This is only a small fraction of what we heard about the second weekend of the course.
It is becoming increasingly clear to me that doing styling on a professional level is really not a walk in the rose garden, no matter who says what they want.
In Need for Speed: The Run, it races across America.
Testimonials
Originally carefree driving due to a series of completely unnecessary scoundrel mistakes turns into a routine morning trip to the ramp.
The ambition was largely fulfilled, but it was useless when no one seemed to want to do anything extra.
The new installment, subtitled The Run, raised high expectations for the release.
He promised that the old Need for Speed racing series would once again move a bit in a new direction, and from playable demonstrations it seemed like a game that would not have to be just in number in the action racing genre.
We were also curious to see how the inserted passages will turn out, in which the main character gets out of the car and runs on his own.
However, as with the NFS series, many of the results are a bit different than we expected.
These are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole drags down a few unnecessary mistakes that have been appearing in the series for more or less several years.
So these are not actually mistakes, but rather a manifestation of a kind of incomprehensible laziness of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are introduced to a story whose main character Jack has certain problems of a personal nature and as a solution is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
Get behind the wheel on the west coast of San Francisco and your task is to arrive first in New York.
The idea brings with it several interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race is on a different track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
It doesn’t feel like the game is always offering the same thing.
In addition, some of the environments are very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's nothing world-class.
But driving across deserts, autumn landscapes or high in the snowy mountains looks visually very pleasant.
Moreover, the races are from time to time enriched by some unusual element.
In the desert, for example, you become entangled in a sandstorm, which significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you have to be careful not to fall into an avalanche.
In addition, the individual races are quite well planted behind each other.
There are only a few types, but that’s enough.
For a while, you try to overtake the required number of opponents (basically a classic race), then you catch up with the time (classic fight with stopwatches) and then a duel with a single opponent is waiting for you.
From time to time, the police will get involved in this, which makes all your efforts even more unpleasant.
The novelty is the passages outside the car.
It’s more like an interactive animation where Jack usually runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right times.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer of these passages in the game than you would expect (perhaps even just three).
In the end, however, it is to the benefit of the matter, because this element does not have a chance to become annoying and in the context of the above, it belongs to the elements that diversify the game.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the previous parts.
This means that today it is definitely not much, but it can not be said that it would be a negative.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will have to look elsewhere.
But the more active racing concept of the local driving model still suits quite well, although we would be able to find a better one in the competition.
So far everything is in perfect order.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
Contrary to the model of the road, the model is no longer very good.
From a game of this type, we do not expect it to calculate complex deformations and collisions, but if you have no idea how your car will behave before practically any impact on any object, then perhaps everything is not quite all right.
Typically, if you overtake or pass cars in normal traffic, sometimes you only lick each other slightly, but at other times your car will end up in a wild pirouette in an almost identical situation.
Or even attack directly.
Thanks to the system of restarts, it does not really matter, but it will defuse you reliably.
Restarts are designed so that if you get crushed or go far off track, the game throws you back to the last catch point on the track.
Only five restarts are available in each race.
When you run out of them, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
So it’s more of a help in case something doesn’t work out than if you could rely on them explicitly.
Sometimes even restarts do not help, they are solved only by the need to learn a given section of the race by heart.
The big drawback of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some corners, for example, need to be driven in a specific way, otherwise you simply cannot fit into them.
Other times you will meet "civilian" cars at a given place always in the same configuration, whether you arrive there first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations where you see an opponent passing between two cars in front of you, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to detour or brake them.
It does not matter when you reach them, because it is "counted" so that the situation always occurs right in front of your nose.
Rivals have another advantage.
Throughout the game you will come across several places where, again, regardless of the time, you will always be overtaken by the same opponent in the same place.
This is most striking at the end of the game on a long bridge, where you go in the opposite direction.
The enemy must get there before you, apparently, at any cost.
When it goes in front of you, it worsens your view of the cars in front of you, so at first you spread out quite a few times.
You can understand the intention to make the game more exciting and adrenaline, but the execution is so obvious that it reliably quickly disgusts you.
And it's a pity, because despite the simple driving model, playing is fun and at times even so action that sometimes you literally do not have time to watch where everything flies.
And it doesn’t really matter if the concept with fifty unique tracks, arranging races so that boredom doesn’t stand a chance, or whatever.
An unusual idea is to exchange cars during races.
You need to pay attention to the gas stations on the roads, because that is where you can change the car, although in the vast majority of cases you will be enough with what you have right now.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sportsmen are suitable for urban areas, strong American bumps on straight highways and exotic supersports for technical riding, for example, on winding mountain roads.
The main story mode goes hand in hand with the challenge mode, which are races in individual locations that you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points to your profile, which is common to challenges and story.
For gaining a higher level of the driver, various items are unlocked: starting with cars and ending with backgrounds for the profile.
It is also connected to the Autolog online feature, which compares your results with other players and provides additional community features.
One of the other hard-to-understand kicks is the situation from the last race in the story.
Your car will take you to the subway tunnel (let's go), where you drive it in the dark on the tracks (let's go).
On the speedometer, the figures between 150 and 200 km/h (maybe) flash, and in this, a subway set will come crashing in from behind and crush you uncompromisingly.
In the editorial office, we will probably have a few more days of discussion about whether no one really thought a bit when creating the game, or whether the authors think that we are really such big idiots.
The technical side of the game is nothing special, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in some cases even great.
It freezes in such a way that in some of the more tense moments the shooting decreases, and in some cases quite tragically.
However, this is especially true for a crash with a larger number of participants, when smooth shooting would not be useful for you anyway.
The sound is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an attempt to appeal to the widest possible range of a rather younger audience, a soundtrack from the category "every dog is different", but it can be assumed that someone will not buy the game just because of listening to music.
Need for Speed: The Run is a great game.
If the game avoided completely unnecessary errors, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best work of the NFS over the past few years.
This is how the game feels unfinished.
Fun is certainly nice, but be prepared for the fact that mistakes will crush you in the eye with the power of airport spotlights.

Ambassador to the EU Vice-President:
Czechs have a reputation for being negative and Eurosceptic
"The Lisbon Treaty has quite significantly upset the balance between the various institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five or six years before the situation calms down and all the players get used to their new roles," Czech Ambassador to the European Union Milena Vicenová began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
As far as she takes her motto "Intelligibly and openly about Europe" seriously, she showed in the first part of the lecture, when she managed to describe individual EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and understandable way that many lecturers from the Faculty of Law of the Charles University could envy her.
Vicen also praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first there was criticism that he was a diminutive, that he was a gray official, that he could not play any role, and I must say that everyone was blown away, that the role was excellent."
"He is a man who listens to the 27 member states, communicates well with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
She then explained the new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as an answer to the question: "Who is this European Union? Which phone number should I call?", i.e. as an important step towards unification and greater readability of EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban us from cheeses
Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
She called the Czech Presidency a success.
The Czechs solved the coming financial crisis, solved the gas crisis or organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
She described the fall of the government at that time as a big negative, which damaged the Czech Republic very badly.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, "the fact of the matter" was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis, which is still being addressed today.
Moreover, the new seven-year budget of the Union still has to be approved, which is complicated by the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be lean and economical, which sectors will be preferred, which countries will be supported more and which less, is all on the agenda for the next negotiations.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "About Europe intelligibly".
"I really don't like ugly abbreviations, foreign words, a snub that no one understands.
How can a citizen understand that curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes are not really invented in Brussels, or that someone really has to ban us from cheeses.
He also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
We have a multi-speed Europe.
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation of Eurosceptics and people who pay more attention to the negative than the positive aspects of the matter.
Moreover, it regrets the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
According to her, many factors are to blame, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approaches, the Frenchman next to me will say: 'Hey, what are you meeting there, what is your Visegrad Four?' and he does not look excited about it at all."
In the future, according to Vicenová, the EU will mainly face new tough rules for the budgetary policies of the member states.
He sees as very real the concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe, rather than a new "European federation".
“We have countries in the eurozone and countries outside the eurozone.”
"We have the Schengen area, we already have the institute of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it has been said that only the countries that want to cooperate, and those that don't, should stay away."
"There will be more of these institutes, and it will be a strong two-speed Europe," Vicen said.
In this regard, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the principle that all topics affecting the whole of the Union should be discussed between all Member States, not just between euro area countries.
Brand story:
IBM Innovator Begins Second Century of Its Existence
If someone were looking for the word that most accurately expresses IBM’s strategy, the closest would probably be “long-term.”
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company perceived as very present, and yet a hundred years have passed since its foundation.
The foundation for this longevity was laid by the company’s first CEO, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already coined the slogan that many of the world’s problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan "Think!" became the imprint around which the life of the future giant will unfold (and also the name of an internal magazine that began to be published at IBM in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson’s carefully built corporate culture.
“For us at IBM, long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because it remained true to its core values while not being afraid to change everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope to achieve even more in the second hundred,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company’s current CEO.
Sophisticated system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the care of his employees in a similar way to the entrepreneur Bata in the Czech Republic - the people of IBM had, as one of the first American employees, paid leave, insurance from the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a sophisticated system for rewarding the best inventors and businessmen.
IBM has a long-term relationship with the customer.
From the beginning, the company was brilliant at extracting talent - as one of the world's first companies, it abolished any discrimination, so it had a choice.
In line with the strategy of anti-discrimination, the current plan is that Palmisan will be replaced by a woman - Virginia Rometty - at the head of IBM next year.
She has been at IBM for 30 years and is currently the Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been making so-called pits, online brainstorming, from which many future strategies and innovations arise.
No wonder there are so many ideas - almost half a million people work in the company.
Institutions with a good name
A firm position in the business provides the company with its strong internal and external image.
“From the beginning, IBM had a concept of an institution rather than just a technology company,” said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor at Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM.
“IBM is not a technology company, it’s a company that helps solve business problems by using technology,” said George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating the market directly.
IBM – or “The Big Blue,” as it’s nicknamed because of its logo in the United States – has grown into one of the world’s largest companies in a century.
It is probably the most versatile technology company – it develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnologies.
It holds the most patents of any U.S. technology company, and five of its employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Her inventions include an ATM, a credit card, a financial swap, a barcode or a floppy disk.
With roughly $220 billion, IBM has become the second-largest technology company by market capitalization this year (the first being Apple) when it overtook Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
A look ahead
Not all products and innovations have caught the taste of customers and time - IBM, for example, failed to bet on its own OS/2 operating system, online services Prodigy or computers IBM PCjr.
“If your business is built on moving forward, you can’t be emotionally attached to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms — and when they don’t work, abandon them.
Unlike, for example, competing Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Prospective technologies
IBM has the largest share of revenue in services, with software and hardware accounting for about a fifth each.
However, in 1990, with more than half of the share, it was the strongest representative of hardware.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-yielding assets, while investing $58 billion in the acquisition of promising technologies.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world for the first time.
IBM is acting on the legacy of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that IBM is going through the current crisis intact.
IBM’s share price has risen 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, and the company’s net profit has been growing steadily.
The corporate motto of IBM is to change everything, but not your values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant will manage it.
History of IBM: From cheese slicer to space flight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, originally with the complex name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
IBM took over the name in 1924 – originally a brand used for the company’s branches in Canada and South America.
The basis for the later IBM was given by the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the eighties of the nineteenth century.
They owned technologies such as the famous "pawns", i.e. clocks recording employees' arrival and departure.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the company’s supervisory board until 1930.
Flint hired the head of a rival firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founders of IBM - Watson's ideas are still built on an invincible corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of all kinds of machines for business - from meat and cheese slicers to cash registers.
During Watson’s first four years in charge, sales doubled to $9 million, and the company began a large-scale expansion to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that after nearly forty years in the executive chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA control flights to space - to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969, the famous man's flight to the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic “dish” that set the computer standard of the time, the IBM 5150, came to market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its PC business to Lenovo in China, bought the consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, and began to focus on high-value consulting and services.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the last three years is the concept of Smarter Planet, a “smarter planet”.
Its aim is to make smart use of technology in areas that have not been planned yet and to improve the situation, for example, in transport or city administration.
For commerce, IBM recently introduced the “Smarter Commerce” platform, which helps traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the country.
It established its branch in what was then Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM, the Czech Republic also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also a world-class research team dealing with voice recognition.
The story of an unfaithful husband:
Iveta, keep the donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová (53) said the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová (45), but also a lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from a pink dream and return home.
But now she was not going to wait, and she set clear rules for the rest of her life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> explained.
When Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová granted asylum to Bartosz in her house in the summer, she apparently did not even dream of how her marriage would end in the end.
Despite the fact that Iveta moved away from <0xC5><0x98><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>any after 30 days at her insistence, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even admitted publicly that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, came to terms with her husband's relationship, and now even said goodbye to him forever.
A rich guy doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
Had Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> broken up with Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová just once, his wife's open arms would not be waiting for him at home.
"He is the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live his life in our common home, no one will expel him."
"But he will live it not as my beloved, stray old donkey, but as a person with whom I have certain ties," Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> said, noting that she had already separated from her husband and insisted only on mutual decency.
Joseph doesn't mind Darina closing his back door yet.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta, and I'm not going to change that."
"My wife has set up a paper marriage, and I respect that."
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, shopping."
"Darina and I are having a perfectly normal conversation, except we don't share a bed together," Blesku told Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>.
If Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová also finds a new love, she will not be prevented from doing so.
“We don’t sleep together and I don’t care where she goes, who she goes with, or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility,” concluded Josef.
Women’s Worst Habits: Do They Affect You?
When you ask men if they can list some typical female habits, as a rule, all of them are very quickly poured out of the sleeve.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where there are several female vices that can perfectly pump blood in the veins of men?
Shopping
Does your other half blame you for being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one dress a week?
Do you like to shop and bulk up in discounts?
Then in your case, you can talk about shopping as a bad habit.
Some women realize that they should at least tame their shopping passion a little.
But tell me, who would resist just walking around the clothing stores, looking for well-fitting uppers and then try them all (ideally in different colors) in a booth?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can become literally a ready-made hell.
Just remember how many times you told your friend to wait for you at the door...
Constant Dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Do these words remind you of anything?
Didn't he?
Then you're one of those women who's obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more the frequency of this complaint increases, the more annoying women become.
Cleanliness and order in the first place
It's like an endless carousel.
Washing windows, vacuuming, wiping tiles, dusting, rubbing the bath - at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on clean tiles with his dirty foot, for the children for dirtying the scrubbed sink and for rubbing the glassed-in living room wall with which you have worked so hard to polish?
In case you suffer from this "deviation", try to remember that nothing should be exaggerated, and order and cleanliness should definitely not come first within the family.
This harmless desire for purity can endanger your relationships and family well-being.
<0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC3><0xAD>tky
"Put those used shorts in the trash."
"Are you going to wear those old socks tomorrow?"
"A wet towel doesn't belong on the ground."
If you snort at your partner like this several times a day, know that you can reliably dial it.
Of course, you don’t mean that badly, you want to make sure that everything is in order.
Maybe if men knew that, women wouldn't have to dig into them so much...
Blasphemy, gossip
For some women, gossip is also their own, but also insulting and associating against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us will drop some small harmless gossip or slander there.
Hand on heart, it is inherent in perhaps all women.
The opposite, however, is the coarsest grain, which they like and often scoff at, perhaps despise everyone and are especially dangerous for their surroundings - especially within the female labor collective.
Jágr and Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek helped to win Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r Jagr participated in Monday's NHL game with two assists on the Philadelphia 5:3 victory on the Carolina ice and is again at the forefront of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
From the overview of the thirty-nine-year-old star in both cases benefited Claude Giroux, who added one more pass and was declared the best player of the match.
Jagr’s teammate Jakub Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek also recorded two assists in the match.
After the game, Jagr claimed to overseas journalists that he was predicting a big evening for Giroux.
"I told him before the game he was going to have a hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you get that feeling," Jagr explained, after whose action Giroux scored a goal from the Flyers' first shot.
A short time later, the second strike of the team had a Czech lead.
Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek won a disc behind the Hurricanes goal and presented it to scoring Maxim Talbot.
The second before the first break was reduced in weakening home player Patrick Dwyer, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to Flyers.
Specifically, Giroux.
After working with Jágr, he scored a third goal, after which his shot was replayed into the fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the top three," Jagr said.
“I never thought at the end of my career I would be playing with a hockey player like him.
"That makes me happy."
"I want to play him."
“All those years in the NHL my teammates tried to play me, now it’s turning around,” Jagr said.
Carolina from the match still made a drama, the goal of Tuoma Ruutu and again Dwyer, who made it out of the penalty shootout, got the difference of one goal.
However, Matt Read did not allow any further complications, which ended with a two-to-one re-numbering.
"He did a great job in our Pronger range."
"He blew out the disc, I picked up the speed, and (Read) drove to a more distant pole."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," described the last goal of the match from his point of view Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
Philadelphia took the lead in the Eastern Conference.
Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek, the Czech defender of Montreal, did not play against Buffalo, in the second third he resigned due to injuries in the upper body.
Candiens, in addition to an experienced bek, also lost the doubles lead and lost after a penalty shootout 2:3.
One of their raids did not change Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec.
The home coach, rather than the lost points, was hated by the extensive Maradona of the back row, with the match being played by only five defenders.
"It's bad."
“We only played with one experienced player, the rest were young players.
"But there's nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"We had to take turns, and we couldn't resist."
"We should have simplified the game more, moved the puck out of our range."
We had gaps in that,” added one of the defenders, P.K. Subban.
Czech goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec contributed thirty hits of Winnipeg to the 5:2 win over Tampa Bay.
Five different shooters shared Jets goals that interrupted the five-game losing streak.
How Travel Prices Have Evolved Since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in Czechoslovakia: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At that time, travel agencies sold only tours to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists travelled to the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
The bright exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime leaned towards the West and the trips of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel individually freely even within socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually to, for example, Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter from this country, otherwise an individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, but it was necessary to stand in line overnight with a sleeping bag or have "good friends" in the travel agency.
Even so, it was not won.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not given to “politically unreliable people” who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, so it was impossible to obtain funds (Western currency) for the journey to the West without a foreign exchange promise.
However, the Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country, which resulted in a large number of cottages and cottages, which the Czechs bought and this custom survives to this day.
The Czech Republic has experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were our maximum, last year Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays abroad in countries around the world.
A huge paradox that we are no longer aware of today is that it was not possible to travel freely to the most popular Croatia for us today until 1989, as it was part of Yugoslavia at that time.
In the early 1990s, visa requirements were lifted in neighbouring Western European countries, triggering a huge wave of short-term visits mainly to Austria’s Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to see there at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, the trips of Czechs in parks in tents were sleeping, because our income at that time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a guesthouse.
A typical feature of travelling in Bohemia at this time was the transportation of own food, canned food, salami, etc., in order to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of the freely convertible Czech crown, which allowed our tourists to finally buy the western currency freely after many decades.
However, our standard of living and, with it, average wages rose, which resulted in another important moment around 1997.
Due to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies have started to regularly prepare trips by charter airlines since 1997, which has made air travel incredibly cheaper due to the possibility of contracting volume discounts compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, Czechs had visa-free access to practically all developed countries in the world, except the USA, which further facilitated our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel occurred in 2000, when, thanks to considerable demand, the first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to exotics was to Thailand.
Since this year, direct charters with Czech tourists have been flying to warm distant countries every year, and this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visited by about 100 thousand Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the USA abolished visas for Czech tourists, and thus our country finally ranked among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time in history, Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in history spent more than 15 thousand CZK per person for one foreign holiday, including the cost of the place of stay.
The General Assembly is supposed to find the President, but again there is a threat of a stalemate
Czech football has been without a president for almost five months and there is a threat that the successor of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R) will not be known even after the next extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is still no agreement on which electoral system to follow.
Without it, there will be no vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k are interested in leading Czech football.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned from his post in June and, as he left, urged his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
But in the post-Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek era, football has slipped back to the feuds between the two union chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
On September 16th, a new president was elected.
Delegates of the General Assembly gathered in the National House in Prague, Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov, unnecessarily, because the negotiations remained blocked and it was not just a method of election.
There was also no consensus on who has the right to vote at the meeting - whether only statutory representatives or even officials empowered with full powers.
There has been partial agreement on this single point since then, helped by the recommendation of the Constitution for the State and the law according to which representation on the basis of a power of attorney is not possible.
However, there is still controversy over the electoral system.
The Executive Committee has not made the situation very clear, either, since it does not deal with anything else at its meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary.
The view of choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to exclude the possibility of heel?
"The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model," said Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of the FACR, who represents professional football in the association's leadership.
According to the statutes of the proposed model in the third round, the candidate who will have greater percentage support in the chamber for which he is running will win.
Morava is reportedly willing to make a concession in order to win a candidate who gets a higher percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side promotes the condition that the winner must gain at least two-thirds of the advantage in this percentage census.
"But then it would make no sense for the two previous rounds, it would completely deny the two-chamber concept," understands the objections of the Moravian Svoboda party, according to which the best order would be not to bend and vote according to the valid statutes.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k agrees with this somewhat surprisingly, although it is estimated that the electoral rules determined by the articles of association suit Pelt the most of all candidates.
"I wish to be elected as much as possible according to the statutes."
"In order not to invent any representative nonsense as at the last general meeting," said the owner of Viktorie Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who is running for the first time and in his statements he was primarily against Pelt.
Pelt is an optimist.
According to him, the new president will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will work together constructively in the future.
"All the passions will calm down the possible progress of the national team to the European Championship today."
"Football will be on a happy wave again, there will be a greater willingness to cooperate," said the Jablonec official, who has the greatest experience of managing football at both professional and regional levels.
Rajchl is more reserved.
"I hope there's a deal, but unfortunately the situation is very divided."
"It's not among people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt regulations on purpose."
"This may cause the general meeting to be blocked again."
"But I hope common sense prevails," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for the agreement of all parties.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete by the time of the match.
The aviation special, in which Vice-Presidents Dalibor Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era and Rajchl, among others, were to travel to Podgorica, did not fly from Prague in the morning due to a technical malfunction and was looking for a replacement option to bring part of the Executive Committee to the barrage of retaliation.
In the end, there may be a decisive meeting at ministerial level, which may take place allegedly on Wednesday.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, would like to encourage the parties within the strongest sports association in the country to reach an agreement.
There is a lot in the game: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming general meeting of <0xC4><0x8C>STV, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
He’s running for president because he doesn’t see the right candidate.
If the head of football players of Pilsen Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k before the extraordinary general meeting saw a strong candidate who would meet all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not even join the fight for the top position.
“If a good candidate exists, I fight for him and I don’t vote for him.”
"But in the current situation, no one has been able to find such a thing," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k told the Czech Press Agency.
In the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k is motivated to try to prevent Pelta, the alleged favorite of the elections, from leading the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also stresses that if he wins, he would only hold on as chairman until 2013, when the regular general meeting is on the agenda.
In his position, he would like to see an experienced and top manager who is not very connected with football events.
"I've talked to some people who might be interested."
“It was crazy for me when some people said they didn’t even want to identify with Czech football at the moment.”
"I would like to change that view," he said.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k is said to be most bothered by Pelt’s association with the chairman of the Plze<0xC5><0x88> Regional Football Association, Roman Berbre, a man with a controversial reputation who is known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence delegates’ votes at the general meeting.
It is so unacceptable for Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k to put Pelta in the presidency.
“If he wins, then the current situation is preserved and nothing in football would move forward.
"Combined with the support of Berber, who is a skilled trader, it would not have helped football any more," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
It also hints that Pelt’s name was mentioned in the wiretaps years ago during the investigation of the corruption affair, from which Pelt came out unpunished.
"I don't know what kind of prestige Pelt's victory would bring to football."
"And what would we look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who also takes a look at his former statement that he would "sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became chairman."
However, if Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k were to win the election on Thursday, he would be able to imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
Another candidate, Rajchl, who was supported by Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k before the September general meeting that ended in a fiasco, thinks the same way.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could imagine him as the head of the national team."
"But he couldn't manage the association as a manager."
"I also don't stick my nose where I can't," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who in September drew a lot of attention by standing behind an appeal by a panel of judges led by Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k says he would dare to lead the association.
He refers to his skills in managing private companies, since last summer he has also been the head of Pilsen, which, with his support, celebrated its premier league triumph in May.
“I have the strength to change something in the football environment to contribute to a certain cultivation of it.”
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups, which may have a tendency to influence the disciplinary and appeals committee, which goes down to disgusting situations," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who does not hide his antipathy, for example, to the Spartan head Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>et<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
He would also consider the strengthening of the FACR’s relations with the Czech Olympic Committee as one of the priorities, with the help of which he would lobby political leaders to get more money from the lottery tax into the sport.
"It's one of the key things that the new president should address."
“If there is a tax on gambling, as the political parties declare, I understand their argument, but they have to say where the money will go,” he said.
As a burden, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k now does not even take his connection with the Pilsen club, although he himself claims that the FACR chairman should be "beyond party".
Pelta is connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with Dukla in Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see any point in hypocritically transferring my shares in the Pilsen club to anyone and returning there in a year and a half," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
Pelta promised new FA<0xC4><0x8C>R statutes that would exclude electoral stalemate
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for President, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, the FACR would have new statutes that would definitively exclude disputes over the electoral code in the future.
The Jablonec official is optimistic ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and believes that the pre-election fight will significantly dampen the possible success of today's football team.
Pelta has already promised before the unfulfilled election in September that he intends to focus on representation and raising funds in the event of an election.
He decided to go to the election before the last general meeting at the last minute, so a two-month postponement could be useful to him in order to defend his ideas about managing football and present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and expect to know the president on Thursday."
"They feel that it is high time for someone to lead the association," says a man who is primarily associated with the Jablonec club, but who has served for many years on Sparta and the union's executive committee.
Therefore, he believes that he has enough experience to be able to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the choice is the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"Unfortunately, the June General Assembly passed statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"Unless there are different interpretations, we have had a chairman since September," Pelta said.
It was the revision of the most important document of the civic association that he conceived as a branch to the delegates.
"If I become president, I will take it as a personal task and I am willing to take personal responsibility if it fails."
"It's a principled thing we can't be without," Pelta says.
He says he is trying not to limit himself against his opponents.
He had previously said that he could imagine working with Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, whom he recognized for his legal education, and knew very well that his opponent would be his first vice-president.
For a long time he did not attack even Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who, on the contrary, did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
"He's been in football for a little over a year, he's already had some success.
"But his attacks were undignified, and a lot of people were caught off guard by the way he campaigned."
"That is why many of them now doubt his true character," said Pelta, who said he remained faithful to the proclamations he had announced in September.
His most powerful weapon, according to him, is his knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the national team.
It should be the showcase of football.
"And I would also try to end all affairs, starting with the Bohemians or the reverberations of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would immediately jump into negotiations with the private and public sectors to secure enough money for the whole football," the 46-year-old candidate told the Czech News Agency two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his coming to the helm of football would not mean any personal purges.
"I should first get acquainted with the content of the individual employees," he said, referring to Strahov, where nervousness is understandable from his long absence.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming general meeting, he believes that on Thursday the delegates will not go to Nymburk unnecessarily.
"If the only point of contention is how we're going to vote in the third round, we can get over it."
"Football needs credibility, and that's the only way it's going to get credibility is to finally have its leader back," Pelta remains optimistic two days ahead of what may be the decisive day of his career.
Rajchl promises that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would start working hard under him
If Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl had been elected as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at Thursday’s general meeting, many people in the association would not have been pleased.
Rajchl promises that if he is elected, he will start working hard.
He wants to push for systemic changes and make the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work that previous president Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek started.
“As president, I would like to focus on football as a whole.”
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national team, professional football, performance football to youth."
"But I'm not saying that I would do everything myself," Rajchl said in an interview with the Czech Press Agency.
“I’m a team player and I want to distribute the competencies in the executive committee so that each member is dedicated to a specific area.”
“And I will give hard assignments to move football a mile forward in each of these segments.”
“A lot of people probably wouldn’t be happy about it, because it would start working really hard and not just criticizing the work of others,” he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he was considering not running again.
"I'm known to work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it's going to make sense and that I'm not going to have people behind me constantly throwing sticks at my feet and questioning my every move," he explained.
"But a lot of people told me I shouldn't give up, because then others would give up."
"That's a trust I can't just throw away," he said.
He is also said to be motivated by the continuation of the work he started with Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to throw it away now."
"There are processes that will have a reverberation in a few years, and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, was elected, the situation at the union could return to the time before The Hague.
"I believe in systematics, and that's something that I don't think Mirek Pelta can do."
"Behind it, above all, there are people who would make football so that it would only be for the chosen ones."
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but it's certainly not that I'm sidelined."
"I try to be objective."
"I want to make football for everyone, because then everyone will be well, not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
He also denies that he would be the only Czech president.
"Although some people are trying to say otherwise, I plan to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about the fact that the second league would be divided into the Czech and Moravian part, whose winners would go to the first league."
"It would not be the current situation where there are only three Moravian units in the league, which is a problem towards young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
Since the head of the Pilsen club, Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, also took part in the fight for the chairman, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of being elected.
"I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice-president and sees clear achievements behind me," said Rajchl, who sees his achievements as saving tens of millions of crowns on unfavourable contracts, negotiating TV contracts and negotiating a lottery law.
On the contrary, he feels complicit in the fact that the union does not pull on a single rope.
While Pelt is said to be "disqualified to restore Czech football's confidence", Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k considers the other of his opponents a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pilsen that year."
"If he had been elected, perhaps he would have continued the things that Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek started here and would not have fundamentally changed the staffing of the committees."
"He wouldn't want to twist it to his own advantage," Rajchl said.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to blue
Julia Stanek
Rafting from the view of Ufona, a luxurious swimming pool in Budapest: Who travels through Europe, can experience its blue miracle - and after exploring the cities or traveling let your tired feet relax in the thermal baths.
The book will show you where the wellness at the water is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder had been on a voyage of discovery for the past one and a half years, her luggage could not be missing: her bathing suit.
Lying on the water, she looked up at the artfully shaped domes, swam across the marble putti (the statue of a little naked boy, a child (with wings)) waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and admired the carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked one of the swimming pools, she immediately put it in her notebook - even with remarkable details about the way it was built and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been explored in this way by architectural historian Meder and are now presented in his recently published book "Badefreuden (The Joy of Bathing) ": Folk Swimming Pools in Munich, Historical Palaces of Swimming Pools in Schwarzwald, "The Hard Core of Concrete Buildings" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited locations in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German woman is a true enthusiast of the swimming culture.
With sports, it's not too much, says Meder - only in the water it's something else.
The only anger is that fan-swimming must be content with blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while health runners can inhale the intoxicating scent of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful chirping of birds in the park.
“One day I asked why swimming pools always have to be so ugly,” says living Mrs. Meder in Vienna.
"So I started collecting pretty floats."
The water level doubles the architecture
Splashing in the jumping pool and essential oils for the sauna - the factor of well-being is therefore so great that it affects all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, swimming pools can be a real feast for the eyes: "Instead of the floor, a person has a water surface in the baths."
"It's transparent on the one hand, but it reflects the beauty of the building on the other."
Everything is optically duplicated: a high vault, colorful tiles, jumping boards.
The small-format picture volume "Badefreuden (The Joys of Bathing)" provides everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historical oases of wellnes - but above all, it arouses the desire to jump into the blue.
Remarkable specimens were discovered by the collector of swimming pools Mrs. Meder during her search in Hungary.
In addition to beautiful spas, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, it found nitrate-containing water in the original karst cave (the cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as thermal baths, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in the building of the Terr<0xC3><0xB6>d<0xC3><0xB6>s bottle (V<0xC3><0xB6>rd<0xC3><0xB6>s bottle).
On the other hand, many heated open-air swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer a wonderful view. While one has the whole city in front of one’s eyes from the Zurich rooftop swimming pool, one can watch the Arlberg-covered outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton - and: In the steam baths there is a window with a view of the Arlberg - and:
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the pool awaits spa guests in L<0xC3><0xA4>ngenfeld: the <0xC3><0x96>tztal water park looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From the three open basins in winter, the steam rises as the <0xC3><0x96>tztal mountain rises towards the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
It was not in every swimming pool that Mrs. Meder's pool-gatherer climbed the smell of chlorine into her nostrils.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the <0xC3><0x81>rpád spa in Békescsaba, Hungary, it smells of heating oil to the point that one can hardly believe that one has reached the healing baths.
The smell comes from the healing water containing alkaline hydrogen carbonates, which is almost black and whose deposits stick to the skin as soon as a person slips into the pool - a rather special wellness experience.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed in one place in her search for a nice spa: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climatic spa Luha<0xC4><0x8D>ovice, she came across a closed terrain.
In 1902, architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovi<0xC4><0x8D> closed the proposed spa.
When Mrs. Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw the weeds growing in the tiles.
On the other hand, they faced extinction in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These baths have already undergone three phases of construction; one can discover not only the Neo-Romanesque elements that date back to their creation in 1844, but also the Moorish Alhambra Hall, which was attached around 1900.
Since its careful modernisation in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been a favourite spa spot for swimming pool expert Iris Meder, not least because she comes from the Black Forest.
“It’s already a performance to combine such diverse building styles into such a beautiful complex,” says Ms. Meder.
At such a palace, immersion in a thermal pool is probably a peripheral matter.
Agrarian Speculation
Deutsche Bank to Investigate Commodities Trade
Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank abandoning its agricultural raw materials business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the effects of speculation on the world’s poor.
Then in January, the head of the concern wants to draw consequences from this.
Hamburg -
For federal citizens, the thing is clear: 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable, according to one study, for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of those polled are even demanding that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions pull out of the deal as it deepens the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of the Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges drive prices up, and banks are therefore complicit in the world’s hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer advocates is directed specifically against the head of Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley also act in a similar way.
Originally, commodity bets were meant to insure traders against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, however, most experts agree that capital market participants with an interest in high-risk trades have turned their backs on supply and demand – and profited at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to criticism: He promised to investigate the recriminations and said that no trade “is worth putting Deutsche Bank’s good reputation at risk.”
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is monitoring complaints from Foodwatch-Report.
The audit is due to close by the end of the year, and the results will then be presented to Deutsche Bank’s board of directors – along with a recommendation on how to handle it.
At the end of January, the bank will announce the results.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity trade or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann works self-help on his image.
Thilo Bode, head of Foodwatch, welcomed the report, but also stepped up his criticism of the financial sector: "Betting on rising food prices shows in a particularly drastic way how recklessly banks are harming the general welfare today."
Let Ackermann, as the highest banking lobbyist, do his duty.
“Deutsche Bank must remove from its portfolio all items that use money to bet on food prices,” Bode said.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is concerned with starving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s view seems surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the group a few months before his departure from office would like to leave a perfect picture.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board of directors will not move to the Supervisory Board differently than planned.
By turning away from the controversial agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And he does not have to worry about possible losses - his successor should deal with this in the end.
Every second person would give up investing in raw materials
Foodwatch tries to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Eleven percent of respondents believe it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that involve betting on food prices.
Many bank customers would also deduce personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: Every second would, as a result of the survey, denounce all investments in which money is drained into speculation with raw materials.
43 percent would warn their acquaintances about such a bank, 49 percent said they would think about canceling their account and switching to another institution.
21st Century House in Vienna
The Moved Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
A story of architecture with peaks, falls and happy endings: The Austrian pavilion from the 1958 World’s Fair in Brussels won awards, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and deserted.
It is now being re-opened as an exhibition house.
When striving for modern post-war architecture, for clear forms, glass halls, bold sweeps and new building materials that are typical of faith in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition 1958 is an apt and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and high-performance steel and glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect famous by building the pavilion of Austria for the next world exhibitions.
With his legendary four-cylinder BMW-palace plus as a key made by a side building in Munich, he eventually became internationally famous in 1973.
As a temporary exhibition building, the designed pavilion after the world exhibition was placed in Schweizer Garten near the Vienna S<0xC3><0xBC>dbahnhof (South Railway Station), reconstructed and opened in 1962 the Museum of the 20th century - it was named "House of the 20th century".
But the building was not suitable for the museum, neither spatially nor technically - there were no walls for hanging art exhibits, no suitable climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art met a new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and dilapidated more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has reconstructed the pavilion, it is now called the “House of the 21st Century” and will be used as a Museum of Contemporary Art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the palace belongs, will open its first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, an art historian with a distinguished career, e.g. as a young figure skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, strongly promoted reconstruction among politicians and monument keepers, provided public funds and private sponsorship money, and made use of public funds.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba by the same foundation should be exhibited, a cafe and a bookstore should be created, and an office building had to be built for this.
Strict supervision, low budget.
Krischanitz was then the ideal cast to perform.
Not only did he sensitively reconstruct and expand the Art Nouveau buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and win the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "immensely important place" where he "almost every weekend" viewed exhibitions.
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness during its relocation to Vienna and change of use.
There were far bigger problems with the current reconstruction: The building was “a catapult for energy,” says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, used glass fiber-reinforced insulating glass and the glass roof replaced with a special safety glass.
Cold bridges-steel beams were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings were repaired.
Two underground floors provided a place for new use, a recessed lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still a lofty Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosion reddish-brown color tone.
And the cinema is still exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the Heritage Office and a low budget.
“Often, material had to be found that is good and cheap, and also liked the monument authority,” says Krischanitz, pointing to the broken basement floor.
Despite all the pressure, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
He said it was difficult with the pavilion, "which came here from Brussels," Krischanitz said recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-history".
Such architecture is said to stand "always in the wrong place" and yet want to "raise proper self-confidence".
In this case, however, the 21st century House is not in an inappropriate place, as an urbanist happy coincidence has occurred: In the Schweizer Garten district, a completely newly designed "City District at the Main Railway Station" with office and residential buildings is being created.
And perhaps there is another happy coincidence: The 21st century house could receive support from another Krischanitz building, as collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berliner Tempor<0xC3><0xA4>re Kunsthalle and, as they are heard, is already negotiating with the city about the neighborhood at the site in Schweizer Garten.
The track is planning a package for the winter crisis in the amount of millions
The railway has put in place a crisis plan to prevent train outages in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
That'll cost millions.
In the fight against the winter caused by train outages and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than 70 million euros this year, according to a report in the newspaper.
The newspaper "Bild" brought a preliminary report with reference to the internal plan of the concern, which is supposed to be a total of investments of about 300 million euros by 2015.
It is expected to improve the use of trains and the rail network even in extreme weather conditions.
It is planned, among other things, to double the number of internal and external employees to 16,000 people to remove snow on railway facilities and platforms.
The goal is to get rid of the platform before the start of operation and 90 percent for the operation of the necessary switches during four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, railway chief R<0xC3><0xBC>diger Grube warned after a high-level meeting with government and industry officials about train outages and delays this winter as well.
In the past winter period, the railway had significant problems in passenger transport, because, among other things, in difficult weather conditions it had a lack of reserves.
Numerous new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railway Office for years.
In addition, there is a delay in dispatching ICE trains.
For years, the railway has also been unable to cope with the fact that it has to have ICE train axles inspected more frequently when a single ICE train at Cologne Central Station has had its axles destroyed.
Deutsche Bank to pay $1 million fine in U.S.
After the turmoil around boss Josef Ackermann, there is a new embarrassment in the US: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions in compensation there.
As if the problems at home were not enough, the giant in the industry caught up with its past in the US: the Frankfurt institution pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in one settlement procedure to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgages.
The NCUA financial market regulator blames a number of large banks for misleading cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; that the risks may have been mitigated.
Such securities have lost much of their value during the crisis and have plunged banks into the abyss.
“We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without having to drag the parties to court,” a Deutsche Bank spokesman said in New York.
The bank does not admit any guilt by compensating.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has pledged to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the helpfulness of both monetary institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the U.S. and helps with bankruptcies to protect customer claims.
The NCUA is seeking compensation for billions in damages.
The now-completed settlements are the first of their kind.
The regulator also clamped down on other large banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
Mortgage-backed securities are referred to as “mortgage-backed securities”.
These are based on bank loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, it became fatal for a number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its mind.
Although the events took place a few years ago, there is now a sharp wind blowing at the banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous lawsuits to redress or address misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the largest wave of lawsuits.
It accuses 18 international large banks of defrauding two state-owned U.S. real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of about $200 billion in mortgage deals.
Deutsche Bank also has to face a lawsuit from FHFA, which involved multiple deals totaling about $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The watchdog is demanding that the Frankfurt Institute be held accountable for "significant losses", without specifying an exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with $10 billion
Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in IBM’s IT enterprise.
Since March, he has bought more than $10 billion worth of shares.
US investor Warren Buffett has always said he would not invest in IT and computers because the long-term development of companies can only be predicted with difficulty.
But now he’s read IBM’s business reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
Much earlier, he had to understand that IBM primarily offers services and acquires computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
Warren Buffett’s investment is considered a knighthood in the financial world.
As a result, it can be called IBM's mother rock now "Sir IBM".
Buffett told CNBC that he has bought 10.7 billion dollars worth of IBM stock since March.
Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that IBM didn’t know anything about his involvement.
He praised the management, which even tried for proper returns during the economic crisis.
“You did a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long relied on lucrative IT services such as the operation of computing centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful computers for businesses.
Buffett has avoided tech companies to this day.
He says he only invests in companies whose activities he also understands.
Instead, Buffett reached for the freight rail, the lubricant manufacturer, or the machine manufacturers.
His Berkshire Hathaway Holding owns, in addition to about 80 of its own subsidiaries, also shares in a number of large concerns such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former M<0xC3><0xBC>nchener R<0xC3><0xBC>ck.
The 81-year-old took over the small textile firm Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built one of the world’s most valuable businesses with wise investments.
Yet his way of life is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of money-making earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
When Buffett’s investment became known, IBM’s stock rose by one percent before the stock market opened.
“Big Blue,” as IBM is also called, has a total exchange value of more than $220 billion and is considered, along with Apple and Microsoft, to be the world’s most valuable technology companies.
At Microsoft, so much Buffett, he wouldn't want to get in.
The founder, Bill Gates, is a close friend.
The threat is tangible.
After the revelation of the "Cell in Zwickau" Turkish media doubt about the German rule of law.
The newspaper even talks about a “bloody ideology” that is now coming to life again.
The murders of eight small businessmen of Turkish origin and one Greek between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
In Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany, fear and worry have responded to this report.
For many German Turks, this brings back a specter that has long been considered dead: Since the arson attacks in M<0xC3><0xB6>lln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence to the right-wing extremist background.
There has never been any doubt about the existence of xenophobia in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network reveals a range whose dimensions can no longer be seen.
"Is the bloody ideology alive again?" was the headline of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, points out that one of the perpetrators was supposed to be a secret police agent of the constitutional protection unit, and fears that German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish municipality of Germany reacted prudently: it recalled the weekend’s demonstrations in silence outside the Brandeburg Gate of victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, recalled the solemn act of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, a common life was staged - as a history of success.
Several Turkish media outlets are reporting that "Germany's Gift to the Fifties" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform Haber X, which reports on the background of the murder series.
Also, the publication of the newspaper "H<0xC3><0xBC>rriyet" for Germany can not be taken, so as not to implement this thought connection.
"It's starting to smell," is the title of a column by Ahmet K<0xC3><0xBC>lahci.
It emphasizes that the people who paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany were murdered.
The most critical discussion in the German-Turkish Internet forums is the progress of the police and its late success in the search.
Why the German authorities did not think much earlier to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Thus, many are at least rhetorically ready to use drastic means: "If action continues to be carried out here so superficially, immigrants will be left with nothing but their own defense and armament".
"That would be the best self-defense."
“The quality of the clarification and proportionality of the punishment of the entire network very strongly depends on the internal peace in Germany,” writes “Selen”.
What it means when internal peace in Germany is threatened is explained by the attacks in M<0xC3><0xB6>lln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photograph of the Solingen incineration site is deeply etched in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
For no other event has made it more clear to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat and to the Germans that distrust and distance can result in right-wing violence.
However, the assassinations made the Turkish side feel more reciprocated.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
At the time, the Turkish press was mainly critical of the failure of German politics after the assassinations: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in M<0xC3><0xB6>lln who survived.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish state president, but at a mourning ceremony in Cologne, he was represented by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then calculated in his speech what fees the local Turks paid.
It is as if the value of a man is measured by the amount of his taxes.
Current Turkish media reports show once again how deep is the distrust of many German Turks in the local state-legal order.
In addition to the efforts to clarify and re-evaluate far-right terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
Scandalous bank at Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has suffered near-bankruptcy in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now a German has to deal with it.
Axel Weber certainly didn't think so.
After his noisy resignation from the leadership of the Federal Bank in July, it became known that he will start 2013 in an almost equally spectacular new job: the president of the board of the Swiss large bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber enjoyed it publicly, praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity, and making friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS has reached a turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel."
By September, however, it was clear that things were going to be very different.
One UBS dealer in London bypassed all of the bank’s security systems and lost approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.7 billion.
The head of the board of UBS Oswald Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel, not only a respected banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
The president of UBS’s board of directors has been similarly scalded ever since – and everyone is asking: When is Axel Weber finally coming?
It has already become known that Weber has been allowed to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the presidency of the board in May - not until 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
It's gonna be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather a professor of economics and an issuing banker, and he would certainly need time to work.
At the same time, he will take responsibility for the bank’s strategy, which has once again proved that it deserves the title of “Bank of the Biggest Scandals in Europe”.
Because UBS is huge on the one hand - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and has been sliding from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, will remain the proud Swiss bank spared.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS enjoyed an excellent reputation.
The image of a silent and solid, but also cunning asset manager is combined with ambitious goals: It also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
Thus, UBS 2007 managed, on the one hand, with $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it has advanced as an investment bank to the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later long-time professor of banking in Zurich, says: “I always referred to UBS as a model of a good bank for my students back then.”
"From today's point of view, one asks, 'How could I have been so wrong?'
He was very wrong.
In 2007, for the first time, it was clear that something had gone wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, the chairman of the board of directors, who until now was considered a highly intelligent and also a brilliant banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, he wondered why he had left.
The investment division of the bank squandered Subprime-papers and had to write off billions.
To make up for this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
But it did find investors, some of whom it would have turned a blind eye to recently: an opaque Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore, and an Arab sovereign wealth fund so discreet that one didn’t even know its name.
But that was only the first impact.
Things got worse in April 2008.
The bank had to admit new billion-dollar losses, the president of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, 2006 still the second highest paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, a disaster followed: UBS stood by its flawed investments during the financial crisis before collapse and had to be bailed out by the state.
Nationalbank bought tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, and the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs to compulsory convertible bonds, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - for it had noticed how dramatic it was for a small country to have such large banks on its territory.
After all, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times the output of the Swiss economy (see figure).
“Once again, we couldn’t save UBS,” says banking expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by the second.
For several months now, UBS has capitulated in a tax dispute with America and has shown a willingness to release the data of wealthy customers who, if possible, with the help of banks, cut taxes.
In addition, it agreed to pay out $780 million - as a return of unauthorized profits from these transactions, including a fine surcharge.
This made UBS more or less openly aware that it was helping to cut taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich clients: the halo of discretion.
After this scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer what it used to be.
This was followed by the resignation of the head of the board of directors and the president of the board of directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, the bank lost its credibility over the course of several months in both central business areas: in investment banking due to bad speculation and in asset management to aid in tax cuts.
And just as things were calming down again, just when UBS was thought to have recovered again, here comes this unfortunate commercial anabasis: A single dealer had wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
And it is clear: with risk management in investment banking, this is probably still not working.
“The case of Adoboli has probably found that risk control has changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, an economist and finance professor of finance at the University of Zurich’s Banking Institute.
Also, the CFO of a large German bank is sure: "The problem with UBS is that it does not manage risk control."
It was, after all, precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago set out to become the guardians of the world's great possessions: no too great risks, but security for money - also from this side the Alpine republic again collapsed the world.
Swiss bank vaults have become a symbol of unshakable reliability like Lindt and Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli for particularly high-quality chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the cliche of a good Swiss private bank - it's just a little bit bigger.
The location is classic.
The bank has its headquarters in Bahnhofstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, Zurich, which leads directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the rental shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery such as Tiffany's can be found here among Swiss traditional shops such as the Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli pastry shops.
Swiss banks have been based here for centuries: from Nationalbank through Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius B<0xC3><0xA4>r.
The UBS reception hall is entered through a heavy revolving door.
Inside are walls lined with marble, in front of them are massive leather armchairs, next to the bank logo a large signboard to the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
The Swiss banks, both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have, at times, suppressed or betrayed this idea, according to the head of a small Swiss private bank.
His name would rather not be read in the newspapers, he eventually closes, like all Swiss bankers, deals with both large banks.
UBS has probably grown too large, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also expanded.
The Swiss have nothing to say.
"And if they had, they would have adapted to the Anglo-Saxon ways long ago."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, causing it high profits at first and then disaster: No European financial institute has lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as Schweizer Gro<0xC3><0x9F>bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of a small country of seven million people agreed to the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas H<0xC3><0xA4>ssig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
As much as 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, were approved by politicians to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this have happened?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of Switzerland's three large banks merged into a large group.
A bank was created that was already too big for a small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and was still growing.
It helped that the two different banking predecessors of UBS complemented each other: One rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a focus on wealth management, and a poorer but more internationally engaged bank.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers came up with a lot of money to play big roulette with.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 head of UBS, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board of directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were the team of the future,” says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest one who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the gut-man who's grown from banking science all the way up."
But Ospel was said to have relied on Wuffli in the end.
And Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake in the end: “He probably thought his models were reality,” Geiger says.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: Pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the meetings of executives at which the group’s head Wuffli repeated the same slogan over and over again: To knock Goldman Sachs from the throne down.
The Bank of America was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
It featured "League Tables", a ranking documenting the success of the banks of the time.
In it, UBS tried to position itself entirely at the top.
She had already taken a few steps.
In the foreign exchange and stock trade, she participated in the game at the very top.
However, the business advisers who have been appointed point out one weakness: In international interest trade, in the speech of the "Fixed Income" bankers, there is probably a great distance behind the largest banks.
UBS probably has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS set out on an adventure that nearly cost her her existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and its hedge fund have invested in U.S. investments in Subprime.
It developed into a massive machine that repackaged securities into US mortgage loans and passed them on — but also kept the risks to itself.
Even when other banks were looking for a way out.
“Back in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, UBS was buying there,” says banking expert Geiger.
As big as the euphoria is, so deep is the fall.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Positions at UBS have become ejection seats and are still swinging to this day.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost unmanageable job.
They have to find a strategy for the bank, which all the close business models have disappeared.
Banking expert Geiger already has an idea: An end to investment banking, a concentration on asset management, a return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t (yet) want to go that far.
But investment banking is about to decline strongly, so much is now clear.
Next Thursday, the new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was seen as merely a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with its predecessor, Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel.
In the meantime, he has made a strong case: he is to run UBS’s long-term business, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state in the mid-1990s.
3,500 seats will be cut.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does he want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is already asking himself.
However, he says publicly that he and his wife will first find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
The fear of recession in Europe weighs on the stock market in the US.
The impending recession in Europe has taken away the courage of American investors to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome did not achieve the intended impact.
The sluggish production of industry on the continent has stifled hopes of stabilising the debt crisis.

First of all, financial values were on the sales cards.
The Dow-Jones Standard Value Index fell 0.6 percent from 12,078 points to close.

In Frankfurt, Dax said goodbye with a 1.2 percent drop from 5,985 counters.
Industry in the 17 countries using the euro has significantly reduced its production and is preparing to end the boom.
Enterprises produced 2% less in September than in the previous month, according to Eurostat.
“We’re not an island, we’re an island,” said Steve Goldman, Goldman’s managing director.
Europe will probably not recover so quickly from the recession, and there are other signs of weakness in the banks.
The investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this view: He said in a CNBC interview that it would probably not yet be clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
Therefore, it is probably too early for him to invest in European state loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett abandoned a decades-old principle and entered the American technology industry.
His investment of more than $10 billion in IBM boosted the traditional group’s stock price and left it up almost one percent above the trend in the course of trading.

Smart Crows Are Spreading in Cities
In many places, field ravens are considered "problem birds": However, these highly intelligent animals cannot be driven out of cities for a long time, experts say.
Some people like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: Crows have been part of the image of the city for centuries, yet in some communities, complaints of dirt and noise caused by animals are accumulating.
There is no "problem bird" in sight.
Field ravens can no longer be driven out of cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in Leer, East Africa.
There, experts from all over the federal territory consulted about possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Conservationists also derived the problems of cities from the exodus of specially protected field ravens: The use of chemicals in agriculture is likely to increasingly destroy traditional areas for life.
Persecution, increasing development, and the felling of typical nesting trees make life difficult for birds.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs are located, among others, in Westphalian Soest, in the north-west, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and in Leer.
There he sparked a 2005 controversial project of mass killing of crows in a rural district with negative headlines.
Critics have called trapping animals for birds and slaughtering sticks particularly brutal.
"Normal expulsion, intimidation, nothing brings," urbanist and landscape painter Werner Kl<0xC3><0xB6>ver of Leer found so much.
Removing nests by spraying water or felling trees often has undesirable consequences, environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg said.
“The animals are retreating, the great colonies are splitting and dividing into other places.”
Scare is only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them out."
Without the surrounding area, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
A combination of expelling animals from sensitive residential areas and attracting them to settle elsewhere is conceivable.
"The information board instead of chain saws," on the other hand, promoted psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens because of the completely different treatment of animals: "One bite in the face can ultimately be best endured with self-confidence."
In Schleswig-Holstein, J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens co-founded the Ascherberg Science Crow Trail, which provides information boards on the life of the highly intelligent field raven.
In the meantime, the project has already been accepted by tourists.
Also, to criticize the noise caused by birds, Mrs. J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens had her own opinion: "This is about every volume of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and dexterity of the animals are legendary: the field ravens not only use tools to achieve a treat, but even make their tool as a tool.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the behavior on four field ravens on how far the intelligence of birds goes.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that the stones must cause the collapse of the structure in order to get to the larva of the mole.
Without much training, they knew what size and shape the stone must have to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, the cunning crows then had to solve a more difficult problem.
In the vertical cylinder, the researchers placed a small container with the larva of the mole.
Birds couldn't reach their prey with their beak.
But the researchers put pieces of wire in there.
From them she formed all four animals a hook, with the help of which she used as a hook to chase the container from the tube by the holder.
Three of the four field ravens even managed to do it with a sledgehammer.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal for the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for the cup did not work out.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are participating in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland won their last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the Play-offs.
Led by the twice-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal defeated Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth participation in a row at the European Championship perfect after the result of 0:0 in the first match.
Czechs were enough in retaliation Play-off with the outsider Montenegro result 1:0 (0:0), when the first match was a clear thing.
Croatia also did not give the goal with 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland reached a 1: 1 (1:0) free against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored more goals for Portugal.
Former professional from Wolfsburg from the Federal League Zvjezdan Misimovic changed penalty (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) twice reduced for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic received a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia has already failed in the play-offs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa with Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal managed to make a start.
Ronaldo soon reached the lead by hanging the free kick from about 30 meters into the net.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his qualities in long-range shooting and adjusted the shot from 25 meters to 2: 0.
The Bosnians, who did not play in the first half-hour, had their first clear chance in goalkeeper Edin Dzek.
Former Wolfsburu player from England at the head of the standing table Manchester City placed the ball on the bottom edge of the beam, but the ball did not exceed the goal line (33.).
Jiracek scores for Czech Republic
In the end, Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding stood in the centre.
After the intervention against Helder Postig in the Bosnian penal territory, Stark decided for Schwalbe and gave the Portuguese a yellow card.
On the opposite side Stark made a controversial penalty kick after the action of Fabio Coentraa, which Misimovic turned with certainty.
But after the break, everything was clarified by the 2004 European Vice-Champion with four goals.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended his last doubts in the 81st minute.
With this, the 1976 European Champion leaves for the fifth time in a row for the European Championship.
Coach Michal Bilek’s team with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second at the initial stage.
Goalkeeper Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech prevented reflexively, at the last moment, Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Sivok’s own goalkeeper (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired in the 40th minute from a turn from the border of the criminal territory just around <0xC4><0x8C>ech's goal.
After the break, the crossbar had to save the place of the already knocked down world-class Czech goalkeeper, again reducing the striker FC Soul (50th).
Shortly before the end, the gate finally cleared everything up.
Turkey missed the football miracle from Zagreb at the time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not exceed 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink almost certainly has to relax his place on the third bench during the 2002 World Cup, Croatia is allowed to enjoy its fourth participation in the final round of the European Championship.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks should experience an almost fairytale start.
Selcuk Inan hit only a pole in the seventh minute with a shot from a distance, the attacker Kazim also could not hang the reflected ball in the goal.
After this terrible second, Croatia was increasingly in control.
Also, after the break, the Croats did not receive the goal.
In addition to Mario Mandzukice from VfL Wolfsburg, who had been releasing Dortmund's Ivan Perisic since the 62nd minute, there were also legionnaires from the Federal League Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt).
Trapattoni goes to the European Championship
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation in the European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who took care of the success of 4:0 in the first match already a preliminary decision, in the 32nd minute to lead.
Konstantin Vassilyev (57th) equalized for guests.
Ireland set the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian defense prevent a possible leading goalkeeper.
But in the 32nd minute it was a long way off.
After an unsuccessful defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball over the line to the state of 1: 0.

By 2015, it will be worth about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros), Dax said on Tuesday.
“We will build additional R&D facilities and employ the right people,” said Bill McDermott, the company’s deputy chief executive, at a customer trade fair in Beijing.
The current workforce is expected to grow from 2,500 to 4,500.
The number of branches of the world’s leading enterprise software company will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of SAP’s worldwide more than 176,000 customers are in a country experiencing a boom.
China’s growth plans are also an important building block of Dax’s 2015 strategy.
SAP wants to increase its turnover to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfs withdrew some 12.5 billion euros.
Today, the software maker, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is doing business as well as it has ever done before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"We would now like to expand our activities (...)," McDermott said.
“Our goal is, with the support of extensive research, to promote sustained growth in China.”
Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund’s emotionally powerful new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War, begins with a long list of characters that make you dizzy.
One tip on how to behave at that moment: Carefully tear out this page and make a bookmark out of it.
You will get acquainted with all the people in Mr. Englund's novel, and this list will serve as a navigation - as a kind of beacon - in moments when, like men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in various situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also a new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book we are talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite aptly, as an "antihistoric work".
It contains several well-known names, important treaties or famous battles, on the contrary, it almost lacks ambassadors, energetic journalists and debates about tactics and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, the author explains, as rather "a book about what it was like". It deals mainly with "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and Grief" combines the war experiences of 20 more or less dozen men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from female students and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go insane, or die.
Their lives flicker like the flames of candles lit in a church - new ones are added to the tangle of destinies, while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book differs from classic historical novels.
It modifies the notion that the First World War was all about the terrible trench battles on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Grief" deftly explores other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book deal with the problems of falling on them bee nests, having to spend Christmas in the shadow of the pyramids or struggling with the presence of flies tse-tse.
Almost from the beginning it is a very touching read.
War engulfs people's lives like some kind of natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling of gunpowder.
When cannon fire starts to sound in the distance and you are a woman who is at home with your children, will you run away or will you stay?
Who's really coming?
Almost no one understands what is happening, not even why the whole war was unleashed.
"The vacuum created by a lack of facts," observed Mr. Englund, "was filled with conjectures, conjectures, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumours."
"Beauty and Grief" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are mostly taken from biographies, letters and other already published materials.
The descriptions of their lives may sound scary and engaging, but thanks to the incorporation of small moments and details, they are absolutely vivid and believable.
Many of them talk about suffering and coping with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says: "Replacements, substitutes everywhere."
"Coffee substitute, aluminum imitation, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
It goes even further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It mentions "meat made from pressed rice cooked in sheep's fat (and supplemented with fake bone from wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried potato skins, shoes with wooden soles".
There were 837 registered substitutes for meat in the production of sausages and 511 registered substitutes for coffee.
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American finds an inner impulse to savagery and brutality, and declares of the war: "In the end, you will understand that this is human nature. Not to sit in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and whiskey, an evening newspaper or a good book, and pretend that this mask of yours represents civilization, and that there is no trace of me behind it.
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he will most likely die soon, and no one will even notice, let alone mourn.
“When a person finally comes to terms with sacrificing himself, he would at least expect it to happen in front of a grateful audience,” he writes.
Instead, he feels like a “convict who will be hanged in secret.”
Other remarks concern the departure of old Europe and the emergence of new horrors.
“Conflict has increasingly become an economic competition and a competitive struggle,” writes Mr. Englund, “a war between factories.”
He captured what he calls "a new kind of beast of the coming century: a eloquent and ideologically committed mass murderer in a tailor-made dress who carries out his bloodshed without rising from the table."
People behave completely unexpectedly, meanness alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
“The most grotesque example of this behavior was the trade in gonococcal pus, which soldiers shopped for and scrubbed their genitals with in the hope of ending up in a hospital,” he writes.
"The most desperate would rub it in their eyes, which often blinded them for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is brisk but not flamboyant, which fits perfectly with his human theme.
In dozens of small outputs, he captures the way in which the war "has unleashed utterly unmanageable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books on the First World War mostly worked with hints, such as "World War I and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussell or novels such as "On the Western Front Peace" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most devastating ending that is unprecedented in popular scholarly literature.
But I will not reveal it to you.
However, you will feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, ripped the page from the list of heroes from your hand and lit it on fire.
After a previous mistake, this time for a minute exactly scheduled raids
It was attended by hundreds of police officers, some wearing helmets used in street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because by that time Zuccotti Park should be almost empty.
No one knew about the event except a few high-ranking officers. The others were first told that it was an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the forefront of the action, whose presence highlighted how many problems the police department had to face during the operation.
Cases in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper sprays against demonstrators, were not allowed to be repeated, in violation of the rules of separation and, moreover, a wave of public sympathy spilled over to the squatters.
Therefore, a police operation to clear the Zuccotti Park of demonstrators was launched after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
The leaders were inspired by the operations that took place in other cities.
A massive emergency behavior exercise was held in the Randalls Island area, which was in preparation for an event in Zuccotti Park.
Leaders have stepped up so-called riot-control training — counterterrorism measures involving the rapid movement of large numbers of police — with a focus on the Lower Manhattan metropolitan area.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move to the park came literally “at the last minute,” said someone to whom the action was originally explained only as “exercise.”
“I know a few police officers who have also been called to this action, and no one has told them that they are going to Zuccotti Park,” said the person, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
"Only the highest-ranking members of the department knew about going to Zuccotti Park."
One of the reasons for the secrecy was the lesson the city had already learned.
On October 14, the city officials planned to clear the park, but then withdrew from the plan, because as soon as the demonstrators heard about it, they rushed hundreds of them to the park before the operation began.
Tuesday's event was attended by police officers from various units, including intervention groups from around the area - dozens of police officers who are routinely used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher crime rates.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day a large number of people come and go to the park, so one hour at night was the ideal time to start the event.
"It was appropriate to do this at a time when there would be as few people as possible in the park," he said.
By the time the troops left, they had lined up at the intersection of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, trucks of emergency units with arc lamps and amplions.
The lights and the recorded message roaring from the amplions frightened many demonstrators.
When members of the riot police entered the park in their blue windbreakers, many of the demonstrators packed their belongings and left.
Police say she did not touch a single tent until 1:45 a.m., giving protesters time to pack their belongings.
Other teams of police officers were seen gathering on the edge of the park to break into it if any arrests were needed.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Police chief spokesman Paul J. Browne said it was for their own safety.
However, many journalists are of the opinion that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her troops in action, and in addition, some police officers were rude to them.
Mr. Browne claimed that the TV cars on Church Street along the park's western border could shoot without problems.
The police moved westward, interspersed with a dense entanglement of protesters' personal belongings, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothing, followed by teams from the hygiene department, who immediately gathered up what was left of the park.
Some protestors who refused to move were dragged out of the park, and documentary footage appeared on the Internet shortly afterwards.
The most inveterate group of protesters took refuge near the kitchen in their camp, which lay near the center of the park.
Some set up a roadblock, and the police began their methodical arrests.
About ten people in the center of the camp were chained to each other.
And two people were tied to a tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Members of the emergency services were called in to cut the locks.
There were no arrests in the park until 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr Browne said about 142 people had been detained in the park.
Most of the arrests were due to "organizing riots and resisting arrest," he explained.
The highest-ranking police officer at the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, commander of the police department, the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department's chief of detectives, was also personally involved in the operation.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "he was not involved in the management of the operation," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of officers waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case they needed to be called.
Blocks were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park.
From these places, the police then developed a protective belt even further away from Zuccotti Park.
At one point, police officers were seen, many of whom were equipped with shields, pushing people further beyond that border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
About five o'clock in the morning, one protester south of Pine Street was seen jumping onto the hood of a police car, and several others spewing air from the police van's tires.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one police officer and one protester were hospitalized.
Union of Auxiliary Workers will sue the city for dismissal
Unions representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month are planning to sue the city on Wednesday, saying layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools attended by poor students.
The litigation is probably the last option left to the District Council 37 trade unions in their efforts to overturn the dismissal decision.
On October 7, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the city's worst paid employees lost their jobs. Their dismissal was described by leading union members as retaliation for the city's failure last spring to allow them access to a health care fund managed by labor detachments, with the help of which the city wanted to fund the budget.
City officials categorically rejected the accusation.
At a City Council meeting last month, Education Secretary Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of a budget approved in June.
One of the board members immediately countered that the budget did not specifically mention the dismissal of auxiliaries.
District Council 37 officials said they had already filled out the necessary documents and warned the Department of Education that they would sue him. On Wednesday, they will convene a press conference, where they will formally announce the lawsuit to the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The defendants in the trial will be Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education, while the plaintiffs will be eight dismissed workers, all of whom are African-American or Hispanic, as well as most of the other assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city had not yet seen the lawsuit and would not comment on the individual charges.
According to a complaint filed with the New York Times, unions focused on the number of layoffs in poor parts of the city to bolster their claims of unfair treatment, arguing that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have long been denied sufficient funding.
They point out that while there were no layoffs at all in the Staten Island school district and at least a minimum in the Upper East Side, there were 17 school assistants in Brooklyn, District 23 in Brownsville, and 46 in South Bronx, District 8 and District 9.
He recalls that five out of eight assistants lost their jobs at Public School 36 in Harlem, even though it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The lawsuit says: "It's not a neighborhood full of moveable parents who can get funds to cover the budget deficit."
Public School 36’s budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way bonus funds were calculated for each enrolled poor student.
The unions say, among other things, that high school principals may have been confused by the way in which a document approving the dismissal of parental coordinators was written.
In the document, the word "excess" was used to describe the action, i.e. to cancel the position, although this word is used much more often to describe the transfer of a teacher from the school payroll to the database of available workers whose wages are paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators have been dismissed," the complaint said, "and not just moved to a database in a position of available staff."
The mission is over, Congress is ready to accept an agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, it seems that Republicans and Democrats in Congress agree on something regarding the uprising in Libya.
But before that happened, the revolution had to succeed, long-ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of United States troops ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will decide on a statement supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) along with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which it should congratulate Libyans on their successful uprising and thank U.S. troops for their "courage".
"With this statement, we want to acknowledge the courage of the people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
These sentences may seem innocent, but no debate on Libya has been easy so far.
Over the summer, lawmakers from both sides have been arguing with each other and the White House about the wording of a series of statements to approve or reject the United States’ military role in NATO’s mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The motion was rejected in the House because of differences of opinion between the two political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
However, on the same day that the motion was rejected in the House, the chamber also rejected a measure that would have stopped funding US operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission in Libya was literally in legislative limbo — Congress criticized President Obama’s handling of the mission, but it apparently didn’t irritate members enough to stop supporting him.
In the end, the Congress’s hesitancy was preceded by other events.
The rebels captured Tripoli in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
In its statement, the Commission on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya for their immense courage and admirable tenacity in their efforts to liberate their people" and "praise the men and women of the United States armed forces and their allies who have engaged in an operation to protect the Libyan population for their extraordinary bravery and professionalism."
The statement also “confirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new proposal receive the full support of the Commission on Foreign Affairs, or will the legislators again be split into two halves, as was the case with the approval of the June proposal?
The latest version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the main representative of the Republican Party in the commission.
Lugar’s spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
The House will vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority of almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, championed by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution relating to a budget or other topic to be voted on by the entire House or Senate.
So far, despite considerable efforts, the other legislators have not managed to push their proposals to the vote.
Goodlatt’s proposal is just one of 68 amendments to the constitution that were introduced in Congress and touched on a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal presented to the House and Senate - and others are only minor changes of others.
Only in the House can you find at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment and another handful that would like to "regulate federal spending".
Some of the proposals are identical, but their proponents - especially novice Republicans who want to improve their reputations - can boast of their "authorship".
The budget regulation bill, which was approved in August, required both the House and Senate to vote on the balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding statement to support the creation of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members want to discuss limits on the number of times members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of times a president can serve.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a range of additions that would, among other things, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
A permanent proposal remains an amendment banning same-sex marriage and an amendment banning the burning of the national flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two-thirds of states oppose them.
Although members of Congress seem to be very active in proposing various amendments, they do not significantly deviate from the average in comparison with previous years.
In the 111th Congress, 77 amendments were proposed, while in the 100th Congress there were 66.
Their activity even pales in comparison to the early 1990s, when, according to the statistics of the Senate Library, members offered more than 150 additions every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than the current politicians.
The last amendment, the 27th Amendment, was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Smashed, but not defeated," Gifford said in her first television interview since the shooting.
Ten months after being shot by a gunman at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on national television on Monday night, singing along with a tune from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and saying that it was more than about returning to Congress to be healthy.
Giffords appeared on "20/20" on ABC News with Diane Sawyer, and it was clear that she was still having trouble making sentences and needed help walking.
The entire program documented her difficult convalescence, which was necessary due to a bullet wound that pierced her skull in the front, penetrated the left half of her brain, and came out of her head in the back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to the House to take part in the vote on the debt ceiling.
In her first TV interview since the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 others injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang — describing her recovery as “difficult.”
When Sawyer asked how she was feeling, the 41-year-old Giffords replied, "Pretty good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long special for the show’s “20/20,” which aired on the eve of the pair’s new book, Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.
Special's been tracking Gifford's entire convalescence since the January 8th shooting.
The videos, which Kelly shot during the first week, show Giffords in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can do no more than lift one or two fingers at a time.
A few months later, Giffords is captured sitting in a wheelchair and being taught by a therapist how to perform simple activities.
Nodding his head.
Lip-splitting.
And then, her first word: "What."
Within a few days, Giffords uttered another word, "toast," as she demanded a change in her breakfast.
Videos aired by ABC show music playing a pivotal role in Giffords' recovery: The Congresswoman singing along with a therapist to tune Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin".
During the interview, Gifford, who devotes two hours a day to therapy, revealed to Sawyer that she does not remember anything from the day of the shooting.
Her husband said Gifford read newspaper articles about the shooting until March 12, when she first asked him who the six men who were killed in the incident were.
The suspect in the shooting is Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held in a Missouri prison where he is awaiting trial under the influence of drugs.
"A lot of people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Terrible, terrible, terrible."
Kelly Sawyer revealed that at one point during convalescence, his wife said, "I lost."
"So I said to her, 'Gabby, you didn't lose,'" Kelly said.
"You just got beat up.
But you'll make it, you'll get back together, and you'll come back stronger than ever."
Troops meet with compassion rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that brought in millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who don’t have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines gathered around him.
The solemnly dressed crowd rose and clapped enthusiastically.
"Both men and women serving in the military were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who hosted the spring benefit.
In addition to Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of military units somewhat differently, the chairman of the chiefs of staff took part in the gala evening.
"They were all presented as orphans," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know you did.
But what I saw wasn't respect, it was regret.
Such completely opposite impressions only illustrate the difficult relationship between the army and the often measured, sometimes glorifying American public.
The army is full of praise for its victims.
But this praise costs something, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly behaving as if the individual in uniform is regretting it.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some people can support us is to put us in the role of unhappy souls."
This topic is very sensitive for military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or spoil their relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger that troops returning from Vietnam once had to face was far worse.
As a result, most words about regret are spoken quietly and privately among war veterans.
When the two sons of retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from combat where they had served as Marines, their father warned them that outsiders would look at their service from two angles.
From the point of view of some, he will feel respect and amazement, because they defeated the enemy rebels and visited exotic places.
But others will wonder if "an evil, violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface," said Cancian, who took part in the fighting in Iraq and returned to Washington to take a seat in the government.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some of the people who interviewed him quietly suggested that he could resist the stress of working in Washington so soon after he returned from the fight.
"When you talk about your ministry, you have to count on negative reactions," Cancian told his sons.
The military’s concerns stem in part from America’s indifference to war.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely recognized in a country that has little awareness of its own military and has little self-interest in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as was common during World War II,” said Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition from politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are rewarded for the number of actions they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The military is facing increasing pressure to take a hard line against rape.
This week, it will decide whether to launch a trial of 28 women and men against the military over alleged inaction in the case of rape.
If not, hundreds of other plaintiffs are ready to sue.
Elizabeth Lyman, a first-class soldier, was 25 years old on the night she was allegedly raped by her army colleague and was 11 weeks pregnant.
It happened in October 2008 and she was heading to the barracks at Miramar Air Force Base north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend, she came across her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if he could join her for a drink in her room.
"There was a warning light in my head," Lyman said.
But the native Texasan completely ignored her objections.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
She claims that just minutes after they entered her room, a man walked over to her, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current or former members of the military will be awaiting a verdict at a hearing that could have a historic impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will be about whether the charges against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought before the court.
The indictment alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to combat the spread of rape in the military, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The indictment was filed in February by Washington lawyer Susan Burke, and the plaintiffs had 17 members at the time. However, over the following months, their number grew to 28-25 women and three men, all of whom claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the military, and that the military, after reporting these abductions, has failed in any way to prosecute, punish, and prosecute.
Burke says she’s going after the highest-ranking military commanders because the problem starts with them.
“The military is a directive system,” he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent efforts to impose measures against such acts?
Burke says she has contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could become part of other lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than putting all the charges in this case - putting all the eggs in one basket, as she says herself - she will file lawsuits in multiple different cases, if necessary, to keep the pressure on.
The Defense Department's defense team is led by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, who, along with his associates, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defense’s strategy — essentially that current or former soldiers can’t sue the military for injuries they suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court order known as the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries sustained by soldiers in active service.
"The alleged injuries relate to the defendants' military service," the document said.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on the matter.
But things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in combat, it is only a matter of word-of-mouth: in modern wars it is difficult to find a clearly defined front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers played an increasingly prominent role, especially in the area of communication with civilian women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers died between these wars – two-thirds of them directly in combat.
It’s time to modernize the military, Burke explains.
She's not alone in her fight, and three other lawyers are handling the case.
At Yale Law School, visitors to a veteran legal services seminar are preparing a lawsuit against four major military academies for allegedly developing an atmosphere conducive to hatred of women.
Independently, the non-profit organization of U.S. Vietnamese veterans is gathering evidence for its lawsuit aimed at the military. This lawsuit focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" that was allegedly found in rape victims in order for the army to have an excuse to release them - according to activists such as Anu Bha's fighting groups.
In December, her group filed a lawsuit against the state-run organization for dealing with veterans, accusing them of discriminatory practices that should have occurred when processing requests for help from people who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
In Congress, nine separate proposals were put forward by a group of senators and MPs from both political parties, proposing a range of corrective measures.
According to the Office for the Prevention and Resolution of Sexual Violence of the Department of Defense, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unreported in most cases, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimates, this number corresponds to about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred in a given year.
In a report issued in March, the level of prosecution of suspects is also discussed: In 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military were brought to court - half of the civilian justice system.
Prosecutors in the case of Deputy Burke describe the attacks only as the first of a series of traumas.
Lyman, a first-class private, reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it was supposed to take place.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape to eleven different police officers, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the tests necessary to determine the rape, and the blood of the assailant was found in her bed - from the wound she had made on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a court hearing, during which she was asked questions about whether she had made love to her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people were summoned, who testified as witnesses of the reputation in favor of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was handed down," Lyman said.
"I had a feeling I was going to give birth right there - I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"They put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, 'That wasn't his trial. It was mine.'
The Lymans ordered her to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was discharged from the army without honor and, therefore, without the right to a hearing.
Whether Lyman and the other plaintiffs move to the next phase or not, it’s a long run, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law University.
However, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to advance to the next stages of the discussion."
Between them and the verdict, however, stands the aforementioned doctrine, which has been criticized since the first moment it saw the light of day.
I myself have been a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is several decades behind because their duties do not allow them to adhere to the same level of motivational incentives and deterrents.
He adds: "The odds are hard against them... but it's important for them to try."
Change only happens when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not decide in their favor, Burkevoa, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, will gather hundreds of other people ready to bring an action and begin working on other cases related to this topic.
"We will not stop fighting with the army on this issue, from where there will be no reform," he says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
The Walls Have Eyes: How Scientists Examine You on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man to present his anti-immigrant views online.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July killing rampage that left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was certainly not alone in cyberspace: during the preparation of the attack, he spent a lot of time at the computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social media sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - just go to Facebook.
“We realized that finding them isn’t really that hard at all,” said Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by a British research team on European digital populism.
The stock of personal information on Facebook is so vast, Bartlett says, that it was enough for scientists to simply use the ad on the site to pinpoint the demographic they were looking for — something that marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million right-wing group fans across Europe, and they focused on them and sent them ads. However, instead of inviting them to a newly formed group or offering them some dietary products, they invited them to fill out a questionnaire, in which there were questions about their level of education, attitude to violence and optimism.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries – without ever having to leave the office.
"It's a whole new way of doing research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not all that surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are mostly young men who are being pushed by the rising rate of immigration.
But on the other hand, “those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind a computer screen.”
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists, and political researchers use this site to study everything from health issues to social trends hiding in status updates, wall posts, and "Like" buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them daily on average provides three different data, which makes this social network literally an "information supernova", which is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic works in the name of which the word Facebook appears has increased compared to the situation five years ago to almost 800%.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
"It used to be that when you wanted to do a survey among people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
“You’d have to get to a side they’d never let you in,” Bartlett says.
“Facebook is tearing it all down — you’re just going straight to them.”
Others argue that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid a social health problem.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that university students who discussed their drunken Facebook posts were much more at risk of the problem of alcoholism than students who kept quiet about the topic.
Moreno suggests that students’ peers monitor the site and come up with an offer to help a student who posts too many drunken statuses.
“The problem can’t be solved if you can’t diagnose it,” said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of the study and director of the Center for Children’s Health, Behavior and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle.
“We have found a way to identify vulnerable children that we would otherwise not have a chance to detect.”
Facebook itself constantly probes the data of its users.
The site’s information team produced statistics on the relationship between relationship status and Valentine’s Day, voter turnout in 2010 and the nation’s satisfaction rate (mainly using information they had access to – internet freedom advocates have long argued that the site should make its information treasure available to others as well).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometers away, you need to provide the site with your personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of research they don’t even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect data off-line, but online data is accessible to everyone.
“I don’t think most users would have thought that scientists could look at their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted using the public Facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they were concerned, they took it to mean that the information was only between them and their friends."
Then the question of methodology is also considered.
Even in off-line research, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
There is no way to verify on Facebook how much of the information on the profile and wall posts are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn explains.
That’s why Selwin, who has spent many years researching new technologies, thinks that pencil and notebook remain the best possible tool to use in research.
“When you go out into the real world and talk to real people, it’s something that can’t be replaced,” he says.
“Societal research should be about society and social activities — and a hell of a lot of social activities are still taking place off-line.”
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik attends his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to plotting two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a “rebellion fighter” during his first public court hearing in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance and among the Norwegian Knights Templar," he told the court, where 500 people had gathered.
“I object to the court because the mandate has been given to you by organizations that support hate ideology and because they support multiculturalism.”
"I confess to my actions, but I do not admit any guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which to proclaim his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought a prepared speech with him, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from any contact with the media for 4 weeks, and announced that the competent authorities would have full control over all his visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives of the victims and survivors.
Some came in the hope of being able to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was held tightly under lock and key.
They all took part in order to move the case to an early conclusion.
"It seemed to me that he looked cold and inhuman," one of the survivors told NRK.
"It wasn't pleasant, but I can say for myself that after I saw and heard the suspect, I mentally moved a little further."
Breivik, in a dark suit and a blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. Upon entering and leaving the building, he had no trouble seeing the journalists and survivors present.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge acknowledged that he was not insane, and noted that there was no evidence that he had any accomplices.
It may be a comfort to some that the attacks of June 22 seem to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
However, this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the whole nation.
"I wish it looked like a monster, but it's not," said a relative of one of the victims.
"If it were, everything would be so much easier."
7 Lessons from a Lost Conversation with Steve Jobs in a Movie Heading to the Movies This Week
When Steve Jobs died on October 5th, people began to compare him to Henry Ford – and they elected him as his genius The Greatest Modern Inventor.
Jobs’ recently rediscovered interview, which was dusted off for a special movie heading to theaters this week, will reveal to all Apple fans that his creative mind had a perfect understanding of the business processes and workflows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, a dreamer and a self-proclaimed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and a person who fits every detail into the smallest detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer "from the idea that a really great idea is 90 percent of their work ... [but] between a great idea and an excellent product is still a long way to go."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the TV show Triumph of Computer Fools, which discussed the dawn of personal computers. During the filming, a unique, more than an hour-long interview took place.
It’s been ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he’s been busy with his new computer company, NeXT, and he’s been looking forward to seeing how the general public embraces the internet.
In the end, only a short portion of Cringely's entire interview was used on the TV show, and the original copies of the interview were said to have been lost in transit.
Shortly after Jobs' death, VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
It is this material, slightly edited, that forms the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which is heading to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is notorious for his reluctance to provide longer interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly excited to talk about his technology philosophy and business strategies.
He also appears to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, there will be a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when it is seen how Jobs thinks over the answer perfectly to make it as concise and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, when he is impatient with Cringely’s questions and prompts him to get to more important problems and topics faster.
The interview was filmed before the Pixar, iPod or iPhone era, and it’s terrifyingly prophetic as Jobs evaluates what other companies are doing right and wrong while offering his own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
It’s one thing to read the posthumous reviews of Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about Jobs, whom we see here as a eager dreamer in the heyday of his genius.
It has its own vision of what things could and should look like.
It was not long before he began to put his ideas into practice.
A quick summary of the seven scenes from The Lost Interview that is definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run a business:
"Over the years of business, I've always asked, 'Why are you doing this?' and the answer has always been, 'Well, that's just how you do it.'
No one knows why he does what he does, never thinks deeply about things related to business.
That's what I found out.
Jobs goes on to describe his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
He was completely confused by the way in which costs were recorded - they often began with the inscription "standard costs", he could only guess about their amount. At that moment he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine the business costs within a moment.
How he made a mockery of the Pope:
Jobs recalls the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack into the phone company and make free calls anywhere in the world.
There’s been a lot written about the device in the past, but Jobs’ enthusiasm for describing the Blue Box as an instrument of power is literally contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the devices using a pay phone and during the call, they were allowed to switch from one AT&T network to another, while using as many satellites as possible.
“We’ve been around the world like this at least a half-dozen times, so when we yelled into a pay phone, it came a minute later from the other phone at the door,” Jobs laughs.
“We were young and we found that we could build a thing ourselves that is capable of running billions of dollars’ worth of infrastructure around the world.”
The two of us made a tiny thing that could control a much bigger giant - it was an incredible experience and I don't think Apple would ever have come into being without it.
Jobs goes on to describe the joke that he and Wozniak almost finished. Through the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called the Vatican and asked if they could talk to the Pope, posing as best they could as Henry Kissinger.
Gradually, more and more high-ranking members of the Catholic Church were summoned to speak with an American diplomat in the middle of the night, and only just before they woke up the Pope himself to the phone, did the pair laugh and lay down.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and looking for spare parts to build his own oscillator, he found Bill Hewlett's number in his phone book and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute conversation, Jobs had already secured a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what a company is and how it should treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
It was as big as a suitcase, had a CRT monitor, and I instantly fell in love with it.
As a teenager, I went higher and higher at HP, hung around the computer, and started writing programs for it.
How to Invent Innovation:
In several places, Jobs talks during the interview about how he invents new products on the run.
Early in his career, when he set out to sell a few printed circuit boards, one customer asked him to put together a whole computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days, during which he had to invent, assemble and deliver the finished equipment.
Later, when he was at Apple, he recalled the problems they faced when developing a computer mouse:
“I remember we were fighting pretty wildly... screaming at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] to get it to stop bothering me, and I went out and found myself a designer.”
Ninety days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big a company takes its breath away:
Long before leading Apple’s resurrection, Jobs had prudently predicted that many industry leaders in his vision would falter and lose market share.
“Let’s say you work for IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers or printers, so what’s next?”
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company can no longer be more successful.
At that moment, sales and marketing are already in control, so companies are led by people who are in charge of just that, while people who are in charge of their own products are out of the decision-making process.
The technological genius that has led society to its unshakable position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
This is exactly what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could literally own the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times bigger than it is, it could have been Microsoft in the 1990s...
Instead of winning, they lost.
How to use innovation as an art form:
“Between a great idea and a great product, there is still a long way to go and a lot of work... and as that great idea evolves, so does it change and grow.”
You will learn a lot about him during that time.
You have to make a whole series of compromises - you don't force certain things just by electrons, glass, robots or factories.
You have to keep 5,000 things in mind all the time - different concepts - and put them together...
In the end, it depends on taste – you try to think about the best things that humanity has ever created, and in some way you try to project them into what you yourself are doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed of stealing the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful because the people who worked at it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, and coincidentally also the best computer experts in the world.
Without computers and new technologies, they could do amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with opponents of the health care law while their case was being investigated by a court.
On the day the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether to accept an objection to President Obama’s healthcare bill, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner ceremony sponsored by a law firm that will be attending the hearings in court.
The incident occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the motions.
One of the cases under consideration was a lawsuit brought by 26 states challenging a radical overhaul of health care approved by Congress last year — a law that has mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the lawsuit, but a 5.5-hour hearing is expected in March, the outcome of which, moreover, will further stir up the presidential elections, which are scheduled for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and try to achieve the rejection of the law will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the attorney general of the United States under George W. Bush.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the Federalist Society’s annual dinner, which has long championed conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations questioning the law, the so-called National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are at stake.
The dinner was held in a Washington hotel a few hours after the court hearing on the case.
It was attended, among others, by Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate and a confirmed opponent of the Health Care Act.
And the show guests? Scalia and Thomas.
It’s nothing new: This pair of judges have been participating in the Federalist Society’s events for years.
There is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to observe the principles of conduct to which lower federal judges are subject.
However, if this were not the case, their conduct would definitely fall under the principle of C4, which states that "the judge may participate in events that are being organized by related and other organizations in order to raise funds, but the judge must not be a speaker, an honorary guest, nor be listed on the program of the event."
Yet Scalia’s and Thomas’s relationship with the two law firms involved in the case, as well as the companies with huge financial interests in the case, was rich enough to alarm activists calling for ethics in the government.
“This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct contradicts the assertion by several judges that the Supreme Court is behaving in the same manner as all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
“The judges have been drinking and dining on social benefits with lawyers waiting to hear their case in court.”
Their presence and assistance in raising funds through this action undermines all claims of impartiality, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little understanding of their critics, telling them that they, too, were easily combining their judicial duties with the actions of groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a high-ranking conservative activist.
In addition, conservatives argue that the ethical problem is mainly with Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia with Thomas.
Kagan served as attorney general under President Obama when the first objections to the law appeared in court.
Critics of Kagan pressured her to give up her role in the case, saying she had fought so hard for the law at the time that she could no longer be impartial.
Kagan made no sign that she was going to resign.
Boeing wins record $18 billion order for jet aircraft
Emirates has ordered 50 twin-aisle Boeing 777 jets with the option to purchase 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Aman Air, for which it collects more than $1 billion.
When a company receives an order for 50 pieces of its products, it is usually no reason to celebrate.
But if that company is an aircraft manufacturer, Boeing Co., and the cost of these 50 aircraft totals a record $18 billion, that’s something else.
Equally important is where Boeing got its order from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced last weekend its largest order in history for a dollar-worth of commercial aircraft — 50 twin-aisle jet Boeing 777s.
The sensational order came from Emirates airlines based in Dubai.
Boeing said at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airlines have the option to purchase an additional 20 aircraft, bringing the total order value to $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, sometimes referred to as Dreamliners, which boast significantly better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total cost of these six aircraft exceeds $1 billion.
“This is excellent news for Boeing as a whole,” said Neal Dihora, an analyst with Morningstar.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to the oil-producing nations there.
That means they not only have the money to pay for the planes, but the rise in fuel prices - mostly damaging to airlines because it is one of its biggest costs - is not so decisive, because the country itself is making money on higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines to cancel or delay aircraft orders due to higher fuel prices, Dihora says.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
The order from Emirates strengthens Boeaing’s leading position in the wide-body aircraft market and puts Airbus SAS in a tight spot to try to break Boeing’s dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing’s victory comes four months after Airbus said it would postpone the first flight of its largest aircraft, the A350, which is a direct competitor to the 777-300ER.
The postponement was due to the fact that customers demanded more payload and range, so the manufacturer took the time to be able to give the machine more engine power.
Boeing Co’s share price rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president's sister appears to have been defeated in the election in Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Fausto Vallejon of the PRI, was helped in the pursuit of the governor’s seat by drug traffickers.
Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost the violent state election for governor in Michoacán, and on Monday she claimed that one of her opponents had been helped to win by drug traffickers.
Preliminary results were attributed to the leadership in the gubernatorial elections of the Western state Faust Vallej by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
“The interference of organised crime members in the entire electoral process, and especially in yesterday’s elections, is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for our entire country,” Maria Calderon said in an interview with radio the day after Sunday’s election.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the opinion poll group... confiscated ballot boxes, built roadblocks... and let people vote for the PRI.
The PRI party ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
However, he is planning an early return to power and winning the elections in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI party hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have beaten Calderon, who led the day before the election, only very closely.
Calderon, a conservative candidate for her brother's National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejon as the winner.
The third place went to Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which until now controlled the governor's office. For a contentious and unfortunate persecuted party, it is a very unfortunate loss before the presidential elections in 2012.
Aureoles also refused to accept the provisional results as valid.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state’s capital, Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug traffickers and encourages other candidates to recognize the results.
Michoacán has long been controlled by drug cartels specialising in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
It is President Calderon's native state and it was in Michoacán that he launched a military campaign against traffickers in December 2006.
But the violence persisted.
The mayor of the PAS, a supporter of Luisa Maria Calderon, was assassinated just a week before the election, and many of the candidates withdrew from the election out of fear.
However, whatever the outcome of the elections in Michoacán may look like for the PRI party, winning the party will help gain new momentum.
Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, an expected PRI representative in the presidential election, congratulated Vallej from Washington and said: "I think this victory could be very encouraging given the coming year."
ADB calls on Asia to help save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has urged India and China to be ready to help rescue the eurozone from its severe debt crisis, or there could be an overall downturn in the world economy that would also have a negative impact on growth in Asia.
Rajat Nag, CEO of Manila-based ADB, said the world’s two fastest-growing economies must “do everything in their power” to help the monetary bloc recover quickly through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the countries of the Bric Group [Brazil, Russia, India, China] were watching all the European troubles “overly unsettled” and said that Asian financial assistance, combined with European leadership and resources, would help stave off a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis is a good fit," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it's definitely not immune."
“So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it.”
The European Monetary Association has been severely tested by a severe debt crisis for several months.
Italy’s borrowing costs have risen dangerously in recent days, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have stepped down.
The burgeoning debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could push the global economy back into recession, and calls have begun to emerge to bring the emerging major economies together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian aid would be channelled through the IMF, but noted that bilateral aid - such as the purchase of bonds from the European Union's Financial Aid Fund, the institution for European financial stability - would give Asian partners of European countries more negotiating options.
Anand Sharma, India’s commerce minister, said that “India will do what it can” to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering a decline in exports and a drying-up of foreign capital inflows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and unsettled,” he said.
“We are facing a difficult task and we need to maintain a high rate of growth.”
“It’s not an alternative, it’s a bare fact, because how else could we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that emerging economies such as India have little to do to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to explain aid to Europe to India’s 1.2 billion people, with 800 million of them living on $2 or less a day.
"One day they might find that the Greeks are retiring at 50 and enjoying their holidays on the beaches, which would be difficult to explain," he said.
Lee Howell, director-general of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian supplies should be used to keep many Greek citizens in well-paid jobs in poorly managed and loss-making sectors, such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the eurozone crisis is threatening a "dangerous domino effect".
The bank’s forecast of 7.5% economic growth in Asia between 2011 and 2012 now faces a “risk of decline” due to the European threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets must create “unforeseen spending plans” to protect them from falling and massive capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon Warns of Possible Defense Cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta put the kettle on Monday in Congress, warning that looming automatic budget cuts could threaten national security and trigger a financial chain reaction starting at the Pentagon and continuing across the battlefield in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will have to spend $450 billion in budget cuts over the next decade, but now fears a $600 billion cut if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort,” Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that Congress’s failure to reach an agreement on the budget and the resulting so-called siege would cause a 23% flat-rate decline and the shutdown of many new projects.
“Due to such a huge reduction, applied in this reckless way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or shipbuilding projects – you cannot buy only three quarters of a building or a ship. Moreover, it could seriously damage other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian staff, and since the reduction is due to take place so quickly, we will also almost certainly have to send civilians on forced leave to be able to meet the target requirements."
“These changes can shake the faith of those who care about our military and seriously damage its preparedness.”
In the end, the cuts will also affect combat units, Panetta announced.
"Although the accounts for the financing of possible overseas military operations will not be directly affected by this standstill, the operations there will be adversely affected by major changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
"There will also be cuts in contract personnel, which will result in delays in the agreed contracts supporting the war effort of our people."
Salary levels will be reduced, which will result in late payments to suppliers and the subsequent disruption of legal and political support.
The two senators wrote to Panetta 10 days ago and asked him for details about the potential impact on automatic cuts at the Department of Defense.
“The consequences of a standstill at the Department of Defense could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power.”
"We are strongly opposed to this harsh measure," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon, when they released Panetta's letter.
"It's not a conclusion we can live with, and we definitely don't want to sign it."
“The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow.”
“It remains to be seen whether Panetta’s letter and fresh warnings will increase pressure on Congress to approve the budget and increase the number of votes calling for the Pentagon to be removed from the list of areas that have been cut.
Panetta had been increasingly open in recent discussions about possible cuts, even though he himself had moved to his senior position at the Pentagon with years of experience approving budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was going into a tough fight.
At a press conference held last week, the defense minister outlined a brief picture of what his department could expect - a shell of the military, but one that would lack a core.
"It'll be like a ship without sailors."
"It'll be like a brigade without ammunition."
"It'll be like an air force without trained pilots."
“It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission,” Panetta said.
"It will be like a unit without morals, unprepared and unable to cope with a possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome aggression..."
In the annex, delivered with a letter to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifies how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: late response to crises, conflicts and disasters; significant reduction in the ability to land and deploy around the world; anticipated unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
In addition, Panetta added that some of the largest defense projects could be waiting for completion, including those that are already being tested, as well as those that are only in the early stages of planning.
The list included, for example, the F35 project, a planned new bomber, a new generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal battleship, and a new ground combat vehicle to replace the Humvee by the Army and Marine Corps.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save $80 billion over the next decade, but its proponents say it is a necessary next step in improving the military, which is needed to deal with possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to Recognize a Lie
A cursory glance at recent newspaper headlines suggests how serious and pervasive lies and deceptions are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy with allegations that he sexually harassed several women — both sides claiming the other is lying.
Administrators at Penn State University were accused of perjury when they tried to hide records of a retired football coach sexually assaulting a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught telling US President Barack Obama with a microphone that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
The lie has destroyed entire careers and undermined the stability of many countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself when he published information that was immediately refuted by indisputable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of using campaign funds to try to keep his marriage a secret.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that rallied around Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term in office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
There are stories of cheating at school and at university.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers just to make themselves look good in their assessments.
Mentors who should teach the opposite are sending a message that lying and cheating is acceptable.
How many frauds do we face?
Studies show that in a single day you lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Let us suppose that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times during the first ten minutes of the first meeting in their lives.
Defining lies, or “recognizing lies,” is a necessary skill that everyone should acquire, whether for personal or professional reasons.
However, it is not a social game that is similar to, say, Sharada, when a person shouts: "I have you." Recognition of deception is a serious branch of science working with scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lies have been refuted.
The liars look you in the eye.
It's not like they're squirming, stuttering, blushing, or shivering.
But do not assume that it is somehow difficult to spot and expose the liars.
A trained identifier of a lie can reveal the truth from a sentence structure, small facial expressions, the way questions are created and their timing.
I have spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from a large and developing industry concerning the recognition of lies, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern skill that can be easily learned and can be of great help in today's complex world - especially if your job responsibilities include hiring, arranging interviews, negotiating or guiding people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them relax in vigilance, direct their emotions, and intuitively realize how the other side accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men tell more “self-centered” lies, while women tell more lies “focused on others” – mostly to protect one’s feelings – that married people lie less often to their partners than single people (but the lies they say are usually “indecent.”
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
This is called “initial observation.”
Thanks to him, he will have a later finding with what to compare.
Notice the posture of the subject, his laughter, work with the voice.
You should know if someone is routinely tapping their feet all the time so that you don’t unjustifiably accuse them of lying just because they start tapping their feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then try to identify clusters of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
However, take it only as a warning signal, not as evidence of a lie.
People who tell a lie may stop moving the upper half of their body when trying to remember their made-up story, they may tip their shoes toward the door, bend to the exit, significantly change their posture, or show "relief after the conversation" - excessive relief breathing and changing position when it is difficult to confess to them.
Interviewers often give a false signal that the interview is over, just to see what the relief will look like after it is over.
Notice also the language of the subject.
There is a famous story about how Scott Peterson once argued and used the past tense when he claimed his murdered wife was alive, sparking a nationwide search for her body.
Deceptive individuals may also express themselves in a measured way: "I had no sexual relationship with this lady... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat the difficult question.
The most common verbal signs are very slight.
Someone can use a lot of "softening language" when answering the difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... to the best of my knowledge."
In such a response, we do not learn too many facts, and often this is another warning signal.
There is no magic that can reveal every lie, but it is possible to acquire skills that can be used to investigate a lie.
By using these skills, a person will have a greater chance of not running into a liar and fraudster in his personal and professional life.
The controversial plan to build an oil pipeline will be redirected after the threat of a delay in approval by the U.S. government
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico — infuriating trade unions but reassuring environmentalists — the pipeline company announced it was willing to redirect the project to get things moving again.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it will move the planned pipeline route from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will be approved anyway.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the Nebraska government.
TransCanada’s Alex Pourbax says the company is confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, even though it will take a different route.
The announcement came after the Foreign Office announced last week that it was postponing a decision on federal approval of the project, from which it would not conduct a study of possible replacement routes that would avoid the Sandhills area in Nebraska and the aquifer Ogallala, a vast underground water reservoir.
"This is a real step forward," Rep. Lee Terry of Nebraska told Fox News.
A new environmental review ordered by the foreign ministry would likely postpone any decision until 2013, a year after next year’s elections, but authorities have refused to allow politics to play a role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the State Department and expressed his support for it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas, it flows daily 700 000 barrels of oil.
Six countries will have to go through this route.
This project is absolutely hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by the work platoons, who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear when working on the pipeline.
Nebraska lawmakers, however, opposed the plan and considered introducing laws that would force the company not to encroach on the Sand Hills region and the aquifer Ogallala, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
An existing environmental impact study commissioned by the State Department found that the project would have only a minor negative environmental impact, but an energy industry source said the ministry’s inspector general had ordered a new review of the entire process of the original study, focusing mainly on two issues.
One was whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton’s adviser in 2008, represented a conflict of interest in the program.
Further, whether the company that was hired to carry out the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had links to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of making her toddler puke in fear
The New York family says singer Patti LaBelle stormed into the lobby of their Manhattan home, scaring their daughter into vomiting.
The performance of the singer of the hit "Lady Marmalade" frightened eighteen-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said in a lawsuit filed in Manhattan's Supreme Court.
On November 10 last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing for a family trip.
When Kevin Monk dropped the car off, Roseanna Monk packed her bags down to the lobby of their home in Riverside Boulevard and carried Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she paused at the door for a moment and put the baby down for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind my back and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said 'yes,' and I left to pick her up."
LaBelle chastised the pregnant woman irritably.
"In an aggressive tone, she said to me, 'You shouldn't put your daughter at the door,'" said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, 'I don't care what you think.'
She became furious and began to speak dirty - she shouted loudly the most vulgar expressions...
She had a bottle of water with her, and she started siphoning water at me.
She claims Genevieve had a hysterical fit.
"I said to the woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" the child's mother said.
LaBelle threw herself at her mother - who was still holding Genevieve - and had to be stopped by her escort, who then dragged her into the waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
Meanwhile, the daughter screamed so much that she vomited, she added.
The family later sent a letter demanding an apology from LaBelle, but received no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and spokesperson are not responding to our calls to comment on the case.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family’s attorney, Sam Davis, said he took up the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all of the money to a charity dedicated to children with cancer.
“The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to accept responsibility for her actions,” Davis said.
"Such behavior is totally unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an 18-month-old child in her arms."
Climate change has slowed the economy
During the first year of the government of Maria L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, unemployment and unreliability rose in Sinaloa, foreign investment fell, and with it the economy.
The year 2011 will go down in Sinaloa's economic history. This is the first year of the government of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, which calls itself the Government of Change. This government has brought with it great expectations in terms of economic progress, however, due to adverse climatic conditions at the beginning of the year, no growth has been recorded and even the main indicators of economic development have declined.
Low February temperatures have caused millions of losses in the field of agriculture, reduced the possibilities of growth of the state economy, they are responsible for a decrease in economic activity by 3.6% in the first semester of this year. In the field of agriculture, there was a historical decrease of 31.16%, which disrupted the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to the report on the damage caused, published by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damage was recorded on 582,835 hectares of arable land, of which 78.03% was completely destroyed, and partial damage was found on the remaining 21.07%. Among the main destroyed crops are vegetables, corn and games.
The decline in economic activity until November caused a constant increase in unemployment in the state of unemployment of about 9 percent. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate in the state also recorded an increased increase during the first three quarters. From January to March, 55,053 people were unemployed in the state of Sinaloa, which represents an unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate was 5 percent of the economically active population.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, director of the UAS Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences, the increase in unemployment during the year can be explained indirectly, based on the steps that have been taken at the level of public policy.
"We are seeing rising unemployment, which is linked to various factors. These include, among other things, loss of liquidity in the market due to resource constraints due to legislation passed by Congress to combat money laundering. It is not easy for people who illegally seize dollars to earn them, invest them or use them for something," he said.
Stop the migration
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes said that a demographic factor is also involved in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people going abroad to work in the United States has decreased, both because of the difficult entry and then because even if these people get abroad, it is difficult for them to get a job. So people stay and demand work from our state, and so unemployment is growing," he said.
Unreliability
The labour market analysis in Sinaloa is also deteriorating due to the growing insecurity that prevails in the area of working conditions. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the employed population in the state works without paying benefits to the social security administration.
Other features of the labor market, such as low wages, are added to unemployment and unreliability. In this administrative territory, the lowest salaries are from all over the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in the state of Sinaloa was 5,352 pesetas by September, well below the national average of 7,375 pesetas.
Reduction of foreign direct investment
Along with a decline in economic activity and an increase in unemployment, in 2011 there was also the most significant decline in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years. According to the Ministry of Finance, in the period from January to June, foreign direct investment amounted to $630,697, representing a decrease of 87.74% from the amount of $5,143,312 in the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the Government of the State reports investments of 17 280 million pesetas per year. These investments were directed mainly to enterprises in the field of services.
Debt (finance)
In connection with the scenario of the decline of the economy, the government of this state asked in July the state Congress to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos. This would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas in order to revive the economy. The local Congress approved a loan of 2 600 million pesos. Until November, no state sector gains were recorded.
Reactions
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdés pointed to the lack of managerial skills of the government.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, president of the National Chamber of Transformative Industries, said that in 2011 there was a lack of alignment of the will of individual sectors, including the state government itself.
"The economic development in Sinaloa has been really small this year. We have to work hard to recover the land we lost this year. In 2012, we have to redouble our efforts, there was no harmonisation of the efforts of all of us, and especially the correct and synchronized functioning of this new government. Hopefully next year will be much better," he said.
Slowness of the economy
Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and limited its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frost. One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to restore the dynamism that would allow to achieve an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services. Therefore, at the end of the year, we found ourselves deep below the expected"
Re-defining the mission
According to Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Mexican Confederation of Employers in Sinaloa, the state needs to be pushed for more dynamic productive activities.
"Generally speaking, we are observing that work is being done. We believe that a long-term plan needs to be prepared in which the goals and economic direction of the state are redefined, because it is important to mobilize all the potential of material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
The work ahead of us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of setting a vision for the future that would better guide the government's efforts.
“In general, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, in the field of economic development there has been some progress, but it is important to develop a long-term plan,” he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in terms of conducting public policy.
"There are elements that make it possible to claim that the government is trying to be friendly. I can say that there is work done here, and I think the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Sentenced to 8 kg of marijuana
Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic informed that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted of a crime of endangering health, specifically for possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by Mexican military forces on 7 June 2010 while walking in Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite Station 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The dealer was driving in a pick-up van of white color. He had a black bag in the car in the shelf and a small backpack on the passenger seat. The soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the secured man remained at the disposal of the Judges of the Second Department and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Implementation of the Legal Consequences of Crimes.
He owes contributions to projects.
Social projects, which are part of programmes such as Habitat, Saving Public Places and 3x1 for migrants, face the risk that they will not be completed or that they will be severely delayed due to the lack of economic resources, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Miranda said.
The director of urban social development said that if construction work has so far gone ahead, there is now a risk that the state government will not be able to secure appropriate supplies that require funds of more than 11 million pesos for three programs.
He said that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos. The state accounts for 25%. By this time, only the Federation and the city have provided funds for work, so it is possible that there will be delays in the implementation of projects.
"They are supposed to provide almost 12 million and even though the year is already coming to an end, we did not get anything at all. And even though we were supposed to get a part already in July," he said. "In order not to waste time, we have started projects and are continuing very successfully, but we lack money."
He said that last year under the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the state did not meet the relevant supplies, and therefore at the beginning of the new period, the city had to apply for a loan in order to be able to pay more than 7 million that the state administration did not give them.
"The same thing happened to us in the previous six-year period, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. In order to get to the mentioned programs this year, we had to get funds to cover what the state did not complete," he explained.
While there is a promise from state officials regarding the handover of these resources, he said a request had been sent to Armando Villarreal, secretary of administration and finance, to speed up the process and arrive at the corresponding percentages as soon as possible.
“They were supposed to give us 12 million and even though the year is coming to an end, we haven’t received a single peso yet.”
Court Approves ‘End of Analog Broadcasting’ in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) has rejected a constitutional lawsuit filed by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree, which wants to speed up the so-called "shutdown of analog signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021. It noted that the necessary eight votes were not found to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Mez, believed that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n had not exceeded his authority when he issued a decree setting out the individual steps that would lead to the transition to terrestrial digital television.
As a result, the action brought by the Senate was dismissed, because a qualified majority of eight votes needed to enable the court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the said decree, which thus remains valid, was not achieved.
The draft judgment drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero proposes the possibility of declaring the decree unconstitutional, since the regulation of all issues related to radio and television is a matter that is reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel). This violates the principles of hierarchical subordination and exceptions to the law.
Only Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an attempt to combat the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the demands and suspended the application of the decree and all the actions described in it, leading to the transition to digitalization.
The meeting of ministers also decided to reject the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a discussion on the proposal, which is also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not identify with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive could not structure through general standards measures to prepare the public administration.
"I don't think that even if she did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulator," and he recalled that public policy planning in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector belongs to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the biggest changes the world has experienced in recent years. It is related to better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
He believes that postponing change would mean postponing the benefits of digitalisation, which requires decisions in the public interest, because digitalisation does not only have a technical dimension, but also "affects economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he stressed, these issues "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction of the state. It includes a whole range of competences that the Constitution entrusts to the state government."
He recalled that a number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to the digital system and have done so through their governments, despite having highly specialized technical bodies at their disposal.
He said that it was not possible for the government, by issuing a dissenting decree that to some extent interfered with the powers of Congress, to introduce compliance with laws prepared by the legislature into the area of administration.
In Michoacán analyzed the possibility of adding "voice by voice"
According to data published by the PREP, the difference between the first and second places in the elections of the Governor is less than 27 percent. So far, the votes of 879 out of 6074 constituencies have not been counted.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" appeared in this year's elections in Michoacán, where, according to data published by the Program of Preliminary Election Results (PREP), the difference between the first and second places in the governor's election is less than 27 percent, and it has not yet been counted by the votes of 879 out of a total of 6,074 constituencies.
In this context, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral authority approved a number of measures that should harmonize local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán has not officially confirmed his political constitution, nor his State Electoral Code or the Electoral Justice Act. The State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force was due to expire in this election period, and the Governor of the State Leonel Godoy Rangel had some notice in the notice of the deadline for their publication.
On November 9, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved a constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislature and declared the head of state's vote on constitutional reforms "null and void" because he has no right to "approve or veto" them.
Asked about the possibility of a vote-by-vote census, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal replied that, thanks to the approval of the relevant measures by the General Council of the IEM, it would be possible for a partial and total census to be carried out by a local electoral authority.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, one or more electoral packages, can be carried out under the following conditions: the election results do not agree; there is no record of the counting and calculation in the relevant box or the President does not have it available; or if there have been errors and obvious violations of the election results.
In addition, a total recount of votes in all ballot boxes will be possible if there is an indication that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever an explicit request from the party and/or coalition that nominated the candidate in second place appears at the beginning of the session.
It will also be possible to carry out a total recount if, after a proper tally, the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in second place is found to be equal to or less than one percentage point, and also whenever there is an explicit request from a political party whose candidate has finished in second place. In this case, the ballots for which partial counting has been carried out will be eliminated.
It should be noted that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where according to PREP the difference between the first and second place is less than 0.16%, although 129 out of 923 constituencies have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinama Mountains, the family confirmed.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown, and a ceremony and memorial service will be held Monday.
According to the family, the colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After receiving the highest honors along with the other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force plane. Family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, the colonel's ashes arrived at the chapel located in the Nazario Ortiz Garza class, where family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m., a farewell ceremony was held at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school technology classmates and members of the American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of graduation.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo, and his wish was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains, and that's what he always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his wishes, was at the peak of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young and entered the Colegio del Aire flight school in Zapán, Jalisco.
Some didn’t believe it because they said he even drove a truck, but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "he had just arrived in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, like when he brought Martha Sahag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zappan for his uncle’s graduation, which is why he is convinced that he died in what he loved most in his life: flying a plane.
They gave him one last goodbye.
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, we said goodbye to all the honors that came to him to give the Governor Jorge Torres L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, citizens and government of the state, the Mexican army through the sixth military zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Technological High School in Sallo, where he graduated in 1985.
Bacio Cortés died in recent days after the helicopter he was driving fell. Also on board was the government secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other people, all officials of this state.
At 6:05 p.m., the remains of Saltillan native Bacio Cortés (crowned) arrived to be handed over to the Mexican Air Force through a funeral service led by Major Jaime Martinez in the area, where, in the meantime, the family, his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, mother, siblings and other student relatives had gathered.
Three Abandoned Bodies Found at Cadereyta NL Farm
A few hours before the discovery, military officials introduced to the media 11 people who were detained in this area for crimes related to organized crime.
The bodies of three men shot to death in different parts of their bodies and heads were found on an abandoned farmhouse in the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The discovery took place on the 1.5 kilometer road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that the cottage with the beige-coffee fence had the door open from time to time.
When they looked inside, from a distance of about three meters, they noticed the bodies of three people, so they immediately alerted the relevant authorities.
One of the men was wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark cotton trousers and was not wearing any shoes, and the man was also wearing a white striped T-shirt.
A few meters away was the body of another person dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants.
The three of them lay face down.
According to the data obtained at the sites, all three people were probably murdered at another site because no bullets were found.
Messages addressed to one group of organized crime of the other, as well as a number of bullet marks, were found on the fence of the cottage, both on the building and on the door.
11 Suspects Detained in Cadereyta
The National Defense Secretary introduced 11 people, including juveniles, who were members of a criminal group that operated mainly in the Cadereyta area and which is associated with kidnapping, murder, persecution and illegal burial.
According to the information published in the first attempt on November 11 in the colony of Los Alveros, 8 people were detained and managed to free one detained person.
Three properties and a cell phone have been secured, confirming that they are members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another raid took place on November 12 at 6 a.m. Military personnel were on a patrol in the Rancho Viejo area of Cadereyta when they noticed a car without a license plate and two people in it.
After stopping the car, they conducted a search and discovered one rifle, a cartridge and 18 rounds of ammunition.
On 13 November, at around 2 p.m., one of the accomplices in the area of La Frauda was arrested on the basis of these statements, and when he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were accused of illegal burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
A new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday.
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that is keeping the country from the abyss of economic disaster.
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that has kept the country from the brink of economic disaster and that has put the entire eurozone at risk.
The presidential palace issued a report in which it announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form a government.
He is expected to introduce a government composed mostly of technocrats, though it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of his talks with political parties in an effort to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult stage," the former European commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that the obstacles were being overcome.
“The framework is now well-marked,” he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a much shorter time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is struggling to fight the political and financial crisis that has pushed the debt level to unsustainable levels.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve the tough austerity package demanded by European leaders, which is the only way to restore Italy's eroded credibility.
Due to the instability of the markets, interest on Italian BTP bonds with a ten-year maturity of 7 percent has exceeded the level at which Greece and Ireland had to apply for bailouts.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of Confindustria, the Italian employers’ organisation, told reporters after meeting Monti: “We said we would be very supportive of this government.”
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this burning situation.
Monti’s hopes of success were greatly boosted by the PDL’s support of Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign by the crisis on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined for good results," Angelina Alfano, the centre-right party's secretary, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is significant because, until now, a number of its members have opposed the government with a technocratic majority, which Monti is composing.
Parliament's support
Monti’s new government must have strong parliamentary support to push for unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in the effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined the pressure, warning that Monti’s failure could spell disaster.
On Monday, Monti opened talks with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women’s organizations.
The round of negotiations will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitano, who allowed for a very rapid response to the crisis.
After a short decline at the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian bond interest rates have returned to a critical low, responding to uncertainty about whether a new prime minister will reap success.
Saving Italy, which has a public debt of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.8 trillion, would be beyond the scope of the eurozone’s current financial reserves.
Monti said his government should remain in power until the next election, which is scheduled for 2013, despite general forecasts that politicians would give him time to carry out reforms and then call early elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that the government must be made up only of experts in order to get Italy out of the difficulties the country has been in because of financial pressure.
Political sources said that mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties complicate the attempt to include political figures in the government.
Spaniards participate in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, ten will cross the 50-game international limit.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 eligible players reached the number of 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the Costa Rica side, when we compare the 22 players of both countries who met today for a friendly match at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While the world and European champions, the number one monthly FIFA rating, have a wide range of A-class inter-selection matches on their account, Costa Rica has only defender Michael Uman, who has played 50 international matches alone.
This figure was reached last Friday during the match against Panama (0-2) at the Rommel Fernández stadium.
Spanish footballers, who play in the Star Games and in the powerful English Premier League clubs, have maintained intense activity in league championships and domestic cups and high-level matches in European Cups such as the Champions League for over a year.
To the previous one, we must also add the experience of the national Spanish team in complicated knock-out matches for the European and World Championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the area. There is, for example, Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish national team has on his account goalkeeper <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who last Saturday ahead of England (loss 0-1 in London) reached the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international matches.
Casillas will continue to play against Costa Rica today and set a new record for Spain – 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, a key player in Barcelona, has 106 appearances.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced last week by UEFA along with other Spanish players, who have a hundred matches on their account. Among them the already mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle striker Schalke, Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l González, with 102.
Carles Puyol came close with 97 games.
Followed by Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rican side and near Michael Uman, the left winger Junior D<0xC3><0xAD>az is moving with 48 matches and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz with 45.
In addition, only 5 surpassed the limit of 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis L<0xC3><0xB3>pez with 35.
The least number of matches.
With fewer than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31) are among the players.
On the national side, with fewer than 30 games, Roy Miller stands with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest did not exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var has only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
Spain's top scorer is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz has the most hits, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet included the country in its tour to celebrate 20 years of existence
“A trip to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes a reality”
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to offer one of the best shows at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures that the opportunity to play in Costa Rica is a dream come true for them.
So said bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South American continent as part of a tour to celebrate 20 years of existence and will be at a unique stop in Central America on Sunday the 20th.
On this day they will perform at 19:30 at the National Stadium together with the angel band The X and the national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from an interview, the full transcript of which can be found on La Naci<0xC3><0xB3>n's website.
For your Costa Rican fans, this is a dream come true. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
A trip to Costa Rica is also a dream that becomes a reality.
In South and Central America, we have barely made it to the second time and the experience so far has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I believe we'll be able to stay here for a few days.
So we are very happy to bring you our music.
I ask, because they literally love the band here, the fans are experiencing these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you say to your most ardent supporters?
Thank you for standing with us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that it took us so long.
Some people refer to the show as the biggest show of the year.
Does that put more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve done in the last 21 years have come out in a matter of weeks.
We did some great shows in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo and we hope that this will get us in shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to this concert.
We love this country, we love surfing, we love the jungle. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its surf-friendly waves?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo. The waves here are incredible.
My friends go surfing in Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico. These are the best places to surf. And so we learned about Costa Rica, through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, there's no limit to what we can't do.
We will try to perform the best show with a variety of songs. We will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans to a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why? Why?
I think it’s partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose what songs we’re going to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in our repertoire that we haven’t played for a long time, we focus on them and we’re also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have forgotten about it.
So the show is more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's more interesting for people.
This tour celebrates 20 years of artistic career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve done?
Yes, I'm sure.
First of all, I don't think any of us could have imagined being in one big rock band and staying in one for more than 20 years. That sounds like a dream.
We are aware of how much has been given to us and we are impressed that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we love making music.
We're lucky to be able to see the places we've always wanted.
We couldn't have done better.
What did it mean to you that you were a significant part of the creation of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be a part of this group in which the greats themselves are represented.
The people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It is surprising when the movement arises from a group of friends, it does not happen very often.
From time to time, a group arises in a city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to emerge from one city at a time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we play with some of them.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored to be part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours to stay together and still have the same members after all these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is a much longer time than the usual duration of the group.
I think, firstly, we are all lucky that we are still in this world, and secondly, the fact that we are constantly interested in each other plays a role.
We are all close friends and thanks to this we have been able to open up musical paths that leave everyone enough freedom to experiment on their own.
We trust each other, we appreciate each other’s music and I don’t think it could have been better.
Your relationship to the word fame was not easy. However, thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew, it became increasingly easy to find balance.
We try not to tour too much, because it’s very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for the music, you remind yourself that you have to respect the music and what you gave it. You must not get carried away by being famous, rock stars. This has never really interested any of us.
What do you think of Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote great songs, and it was something spectacular in the beginning.
As a band, we existed for three years and never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that even today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us. When I listen to a song or look at photos, I remember Andy, how incredible he was, how happy I was with him, and how happy I was with him.
She was an incredible person and we miss her very much.
The national band Las Robertas will be commissioned to start the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that that's why you chose them as your forerunners?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several designs and we liked this group the most. Therefore, we are curious what Las Robertas will offer live and they must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he's adding the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influences you as a bass player?
A lot of people.
My first thoughts are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all night about the bass players I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge, even though it is no longer in vogue?
I think we've all always felt a little bit detached from the word grunge.
When I say grunge, I think of the bands that I mentioned like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the other bands that came out at the same time, and if music like that is still relevant today, it's something great because it's music that's worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are playing better music today than ever before.
In the beginning, your music had a slightly gloomy character and now it is more positive.
What is behind this change?
That’s interesting because I feel like there’s a couple of songs in the new album that are a little bit lighter, but there’s also songs like The End or Juste Breathe that are considered very dark, although they may sound positive.
For both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried, and they're songs that are deeply dark.
I think that when you grow up and you have some trauma in your life, you lose someone in your family or a friend, these things start to affect your art and your music, and these two songs for me represent just that.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make gloomy music.
Peru:
Fujimori Hospitalized Again for Medical Tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori has been hospitalized in a public hospital where he will be tested for muscle loss in the lower extremities, his doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year sentence for human rights violations committed by his government (1990-2000), suffers from several illnesses, including tongue cancer, which he underwent four surgeries for and is already under the control of doctors.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a member of parliament who is his personal physician, told Canal N television that Fujimori would undergo tests at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases within three days to find out why he was in pain and why he was losing strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga said he believed Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself did not want the pardon because he felt innocent.
He was operated on four times for tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms, and other ailments such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been serving his sentence since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people killed by a murderous squadron of troops operating illegally in the first years of his reign.
Mujica to visit Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, will start a visit to Mexico on Tuesday, with the aim of achieving an expansion of trade between the two nations and touching on the political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, on Wednesday. This is the most important meeting of an extensive visit full of meetings with representatives of politics, business and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan presidential office.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political issues between the two countries," the Uruguayan presidential office said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n to support Uruguay in the dispute with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that the countries that will continue to remain in the position of tax havens will be excluded from the international community. This statement provoked a negative opinion on the part of Uruguay and consultation with the ambassador in this European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November. The G20 is a group made up of the world's most powerful developing and developed countries. Since January of this year, the Latin American country has concluded an agreement on the exchange of information to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has been seeking to concretize fiscal exchange agreements in order to get out of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) “black list” of countries that have not implemented all the required international standards of cooperation in the field of taxation.
From a trade point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have concluded a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, thanks to which the exchange of goods between the two countries has been strengthened.
The bearded plumber runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but he has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month in all stores around the world, has been designed from the start to take advantage of all the features offered by the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
“Mario is a character who has to tell us how stereoscopy should work without glasses,” said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, a Nintendo press officer in Spain, during a video game presentation in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game created specifically for this carrier", because until now successful films like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of already existing titles.
A Nintendo spokesperson said that in addition to being a 3D image, “Super Mario 3D Land” is an “affordable” video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you overcome this level, you can embark on a "second round" of levels of the game, which this time are more challenging.
In addition, users can choose real time between "aggressive D" or one that affects only the depth of the action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to overcome a variety of challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This new take on Super Maria in 3D also implies a return of the character to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays to the notes of those who follow the saga and repeats the successful formula from the previous parts. It consists in the fact that the plumber of the bearded man will have to go through dangerous mined platforms in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find news in the movements, in the surroundings, in disguises and also among the enemies, the "playful" Luigi will also appear.
Colom approves Portillo's extradition to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had moved ahead with the extradition of former President Alfonso Portillo, who is to be held accountable in the United States for a $70 million conspiracy to launder money.
Thus ends the process of Guatemala responding to a request by a northern country to extradite Portillo in order to try him.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was consistent with the independence of the judiciary and the executive, and that he had in mind that the criminal court had already ordered extradition.
He assured that during his mandate he “did not interfere” with court decisions and allowed all issues that got on his desk.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n will be extradited for murder and grievous bodily harm, and Edgar Estrada Morales and V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom’s move marks a step of execution after all judicial and constitutional instances were exhausted to prosecute the former president, who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited once its legal situation in Guatemala is resolved and human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was found not guilty of embezzling $120 million from the Department of Defense during his presidency, a process that preceded extradition, but the Department of State appealed, putting the case back in the game.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people in a state of emergency
The organization was created to help children without education, so that they would not find themselves on the margins of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the existence of the Trinijove social support organization is very important: 6,000 young people who were at risk of social exclusion received help. The organization has been helping them overcome difficult situations for 25 years.
To this must be added the long hundred jobs that have been acquired for this social group.
Yesterday’s anniversary also served to present the balance sheet in the framework of the ceremonial act, which took place in the former production premises of the Fabra and Coats factory and which was attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was founded in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with low education, without a job, struggling with drug addiction or in a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday’s meeting in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions that have cooperated with the association over the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the elections, showed the uniform character of the work carried out by Trinius.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former socialist education adviser, Ernest Maragall, and former deputy mayor and current environmental-socialist councilor, Ricardo Goma, attended the ceremony.
The current Social Welfare and Family Advisor, Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries, and the Director General of Social Work at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also came to the big hall of Fabra and Coats.
Mas said that Trinijovo was created in a very difficult time and that today's time also presents a number of obstacles, but added that the work that the association has brought to this day "is a good foundation."
The president cited Triniyev as an example of how it is possible to combat adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
“The crisis is nothing new for this organisation and for the work it is doing,” he said.
There was an eviction of a seized house, in which giant parties were held
The intruders seized 11 of the 13 apartments in the building in Balmes, 51
12 occupiers left the house yesterday at noon without resisting
Everything suggests that the nightmare experienced by the neighbors from number 51 in Balmes Street is finally over.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building at noon yesterday, where they illegally inhabited and where they organized giant parties that woke up the neighbors. They left the building by court order and without having to intervene with the police.
At the end of the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent a repetition of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded," the administrator said.
The occupiers, who took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all the electrical and partly water equipment, painted the walls and left behind garbage of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments there were huge parties that lasted up to two days and woke up the other tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that while the building was occupied, sales fell by 80%.
The owner of the disco emphasizes that the occupants of the building made her unfair competition, because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while the disco costs 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment business had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors because of the noise. But the problems were not caused by the visitors of the disco, but by the residents of the seized house and especially those who participated in the parties held here, whose frequency and intensity increased in recent weeks, according to the angry inhabitants of the neighborhood.
The owner of the disco explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and for nine months forgives her rent.
Police have also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbours in recent weeks.
Alberto Fernández D<0xC3><0xAD>az, chairman of the PP's city council, called last week for "the building to be immediately evicted to put an end to the problems of civil coexistence suffered by its neighbours and to the destruction of the area".
The chairman of the People's Party explained that only one floor had been taken before the summer, but in recent months the occupiers had reached all floors of the building and almost all apartments, and in one of them there had even been thefts.
In this regard, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and be consistent when it comes to acts against civil responsibility that occurred in the building."
Yesterday, the city police also cleared the building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police reached building 35 on Mont-ral Street after being called in by neighbors who saw four people enter the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountains?
The architects met on the occasion of the listing of the proceedings, which carries with it more than a polemic about the fees
The 16-gate municipal tender reopens the debate on the role of the Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, during the heyday of the now defunct Corporaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this self-government printed several pamphlets in support of the Collserola Park.
The leaflet defined the mountain as a large park of metropolitan Barcelona.
What’s more, it was complemented by a numerical comparison with New York’s Central Park.
After the collapse of the CMB in 1987, the park has returned to the mind of many as the upper limit of Barcelona. The Catalan capital is one of the few that do not orient on the axis north - south, but up (mountain) - down (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a nature park goes in this direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars instead of the Yogi bear.
This was the position until September, when the town hall announced a mega competition consisting of 16 auditions for the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
The gate, of course, rather records the idea of the park.
Either this, or someone is trying to place the gate on the field.
There is only one question: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both from a purely organizational point of view and on the basis of reflection on the city, this issue becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It is a subject just as crude as when two members of this old caste, chosen at a meeting in an elevator, shake hands.
And it was this act that sparked one of the rare coincidences between what the three Barcelona architects and the university professors who preceded them thought.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the selection procedure is justified.
According to Roldán, after the issue of the Gulf Party began, "it is necessary" to discuss the "mountain side", so Ildefonso Cerd's speech on green apples was not completed.
“We have to start from the principle that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, its high availability.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect, for whom the name "gates to Collserola" carries a "lexicological trap": we must not imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as delineating zones where it is possible to operate."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the world of urbanism, qualifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" presenting "some dangers".
The danger stemming from the "uncertainty that the public place project represents today" after the experience of the 1980s, which had "its swan singing" in the Forum area.
The first concern is the very definition of the boundaries where it should be built.
"To define something is to take the next step," that is, to go one step further.
"New urban planning and planning tools need to be kept in mind, because the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster."
If we focus on the question in more detail, Modol believes that the Collserola valley slope can be "considered as a park", but the Barcelona part does not, for purely topographic reasons.
Modol also recalled that there is already work done by the Patronat de Collserola, which "must not end up in a landfill", although he welcomes the fact that the city hall offers his gremya that he will intervene in the project from the "first moment".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a kind of culvert that allows architects to engage in debate, but "doubts" that it should be this technical profile that will lead multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skills", he adds) that need to be created: "Architects should only be tools".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name to this game is complex, because the global vision of Collserol is missing in the tender documents: "16 tenders have been announced that deal with all the axis of the mountain - the sea, but there is no longitudinal study that would look at the area and understand it as a whole."
This means that at least he, applied to all 16 tenders.
Otherwise, the design of one gate may refer to the concept and definition of the architect of the neighboring gate.
In his opinion, the town hall should guarantee that the zone located immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should provide equipment throughout the entire length of the zone, which would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
The casino has pardoned Jonas Larrazábal, who will be released
After 72 days in custody, legal counsel Cadino Red granted a pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged extortion.
Manuel Jonas Larrazábal has spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after Casino Red’s legal representative granted him a pardon in front of the Second Criminal Court in the district, which was hearing the extortion case in which the brother of the mayor of Monterrey was charged.
Following the Casino Royale assassination, Casino Red owner Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a posted a series of photos and videos in which he was asked by Manuel Jonás to pay an economic quota for the Monterrey City Hall to allow an illegal operation in a betting house.
After a public indictment, the State Prosecutor’s Office launched a criminal prosecution against the brother of the Panistic mayor. On 2 September, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After 4 hours spent in front of the Public Ministry Agent No. 3 for Property Crimes, he was transferred to Prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the state capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days after a second detention order was issued, and a Public Ministry agent denied the possibility of complicity or organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to the criminal court in Cadereyta for suspicion of blackmailing the owners of Casino Red in the amount of one and a half million pesos. However, he remained only a few hours in the prison with medium surveillance, because he was threatened with death.
During the trial, he was allowed to remain in the San Nicolás de los Garza city jails.
On 25 October, he was presented with an arrest warrant issued by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who stated that after almost two months of investigation, enough evidence had been gathered to prove Jonas' guilt. The evidence included, for example, the payment of 1.5 million pesos to casino representatives in exchange for a promise that the operation would be made possible.
This Monday, Casino Red’s legal representative, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for a pardon for the brother of the region’s mayor, allowing him to return to freedom soon.
During the legal proceedings, the Public Ministry representative assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez whether the damage had been repaired and who of the associates had decided to grant a pardon.
On the basis of the official file 197/2011, a legal pardon is granted to Jonas Larrazábal. In the proceedings against him, no complaint will be possible. It is also not possible to apply for damages or punishment.
After a hearing with the legal representative at about 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazábal Breton.
The court’s secretary, Jorge Yanez, arrived at the San Nicolás de los Garza prison to inform Jonas that he had been granted an official pardon and his case had been deferred to the archives.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gave details of the plane crash that killed the governor’s secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven others.
The Communications and Transportation Secretariat (SCT) said the results of an investigation into the crash that killed government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven others showed the helicopter hit the ground with full force without the pilot having a chance to attempt a forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, said that before the launch of the aircraft, the pilot stated that the climatic conditions of the flight allow.
"The parts that appear indicate that the unit came into contact with the ground several times, the wings tangled in the branches of trees 25 meters from the place where the unit lost its hull."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it met all the requirements for the transportation of personnel.
In addition, he said that based on the investigation carried out in the area of impact, no components were found on the ground.
"The search revealed that parts of the plane were not in any other place, so the plane hit the mainland as a whole.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, it met all the requirements for the transport of people.
The terrain shows a slope with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The Secretary assured that at the moment the most important thing is to get the results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation can take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the Presidential General Staff helicopter was traveling at cruising speed and the accident occurred on soft ascent terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that at the time of the accident it was a normal overflight operation," he said.
At the press conference, SCT representative Pérez Jácome listed six basic points of the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, that is, the crew must see the ground during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
Reports in the AICM indicate adequate conditions at takeoff, accordingly, the aircraft is advancing towards the border, between DF and the State of Mexico there were visible layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that because of the clouds, the crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility all the way to the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last radar record of the helicopter are the same, it is likely that before the impact there was no loss of control or disruption of the flight trajectory.
Dispersion of aircraft remnants in restricted territory:
The information we currently have at our disposal allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a straight trajectory and from the side.
A sketch of the dispersion of the remains of the aircraft suggests that at the time of the impact on the mainland, the helicopter was intact.
There was no fire or explosion.
There was no evidence at the scene of the accident to suggest that there was an explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation show that there may have been several contacts with the mainland.
During field work, the remains of the aircraft were found at an altitude of up to 9,200 feet above sea level, the terrain is sloping, the height of the slope goes from seven to 30 degrees.
The photos show the shots where there was probably a break-up along the said route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have come into contact with the ground in several places.
After a careful search in the vicinity of the accident, in an area larger than the demarcation area, no helicopter remains were found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred while the helicopter was still intact.
Mexican Health Insurance Institute Launches Research Into Gene That Causes Obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research to discover the gene responsible for obesity in children and adolescents. The research is carried out with the support of experts from the IPN Institute
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to detect the gene that causes obesity in children and young people. The research called "Genetics of obesity in children and adolescents" will allow to obtain results regarding overweight.
In a report, the head of the Biochemistry Research Medical Unit at the National Health Center Specialized Hospital of the 21st Century, Miguel Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, explained that a multidisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers has been established.
This team relies on the support of specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The general public, with or without a license, can also participate in the research. People can come to the participating sports centers of the IMSS in Valle de Mexico, where tests will be carried out every Saturday from 8 a.m. to 8 a.m.
He pointed out that the research started at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Centre (Mexico State) and since 8 October this activity has also been carried out at the Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yolt Sports Centre (East of Mexico State).
As soon as the data is collected from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Center (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (north of the Federal Center).
He explained that the aim of this research is to determine the components and importance of genetics in terms of the development of obesity, and to trace risk factors on Mexican children and young people, thereby preventing the development of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on November 14, he recalled that the goal is to collect data from three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and under the supervision of parents, for the application of specific nutritional questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about the physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He specified that anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference) are carried out with all participants every Saturday, blood pressure is measured, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin levels are determined and genes are examined (they try to identify genes that are involved in the development of childhood obesity).
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez said the research reflects health officials’ concerns about the alarming rise in child weight.
"Health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years there was a 77% increase in obesity in boys and 47% in girls, and a dramatic increase in overweight," said the IMSS expert.
He said that one of the reasons for the search for indicators is the assumption that the population of the country differs from other populations by its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African. This fact is reflected in the genes that are responsible for the development of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that, in general, the genetics of obesity is commonly explained as the inability to burn excess energy that we consume (calories) and which is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they get an overall assessment of the condition of the children, thus determining whether they show any known overweight or obesity.
He stated that even the presence of dark-colored wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and forearms indicates the likelihood that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and pre-diabetes conditions.
So far, the information is confidential, doctors pass it on in writing to parents and explain to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they have to make to avoid their children from getting sick.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle that means a lack of daily physical activity, sitting in front of the TV all day and using vehicles instead of walking for short distances.
Excess weight is also caused by a large caloric intake, that is, a greater consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins, and the genetic load that is the subject of this research.
UNAM Asphalt won't have potholes
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, creates modified asphalts with polymers, creating a mixture that has better functionality, regardless of climatic conditions and temperature.
If paving was properly cared for, there would be no need to repair nearly 200,000 potholes after each rainy season in the Valle de Mexico Metropolitan Area, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a scientist at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry (FQ), who added that even if the construction and maintenance of asphalt pavements were possible, it would be appropriate to remove them.
In his lecture Technological Causation of Rifts, delivered as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory under his leadership is developing modified asphalts with polymers, which should result in a mixture having similar characteristics as asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical resistance, both at low and at high temperatures.
Herrera Nájera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climates, for example, in some cities in the north of the country. This would improve functionality and reduce the formation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a grouping of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a large molecular weight called asphaltenes, and others with a low molecular weight called mortarenes. Together, they give asphalt a typical viscoelastic character.
The viscoelastic nature of asphalt lies in the fact that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees it has high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost in a solid state, while at low temperatures asphalt tends to break, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to meteorological conditions and temperature, said the expert in chemical engineering.
A scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most of the streets in Mexico City are covered with flexible paving, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the topmost layers there is an asphalt insert, formed by small pebbles poured into the asphalt and then compressed.
He stressed that every stone that forms the insert is covered with asphalt.
When passing cars or when creating pressure, it is thus possible for the forces in the pavement to decompose well.
If it was a modified asphalt, they would have decomposed even better, the chemical engineer believes.
He added that the last layer called the mantle, consisting of fine stones, i.e. sand also poured into the asphalt, would be placed on the asphalt insert.
Since this layer will come into contact with the rims of vehicles, it must have a greater mechanical strength than the asphalt insert and must ensure the friction of the road.
Since as part of the paving will be subjected to a large load, the shell must be of sufficient thickness and must be careful of the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to keep in mind. In particular, water has a great influence on the functionality of the asphalt insert.
Once the terrain is wet, the water spreads inward and is difficult to get out, this causes softening of all layers of the tiles and thus the formation of potholes.
He explained that during the creation of potholes, the film of the shell is first damaged and only then the asphalt insert is damaged. But the damage does not occur at one time, but it is a gradual process that should stop at the first signs with the help of appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the formation of potholes, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of tiles must correspond to the load of vehicles and must ensure that this load is not exceeded. Only in this way can we prevent the frequent occurrence of potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that when it comes to asphalt, we still have a lot of work to do and research is at the beginning. It is worth mentioning, for example, asphalt emulsions, which are already available on the market in other countries and allow you to easily repair potholes without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing for the candidate from Valle to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna did not win the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle wins the 14th multi-miss title.
Valle del Cauca again failed to reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna had to settle for being on the podium, winning a silver crown and a sash to become Colombia's new first multi-miss.
Based on the results of yesterday's finals in Cartagena (1990), Argena (1989), Argena (1989), Argena (1989), Argena (1989), Argena (1989), Argena (1989), Argena (1989), Argena (1989), Argena (1989), Argena (1989), Argena (1989), Argena (1989), Argena (1990), Argena (1990, Argena (1989), Argena (1990, Argena (1990), Argena (1990, Argena (1990), Argena (1990), Argena (1990, Argena (1990, Argena (1990), Argena (1990, Argena (1990), Argena (1990), Argena (19A (1990), Argena (1990), Argena (19A (1990), Argena (19A (19A (1990), Argena (1990), Argena (19A (19A (19A (19A (19A (1990), Argena (19A (19Argena (19Argena (19Argena (19Argena (19A (19A (19A)) (19A (19A) (19A (19A (19A))))))) (19Argena (19Argena (19Argena (19Argena (19Argena (19Argena (19A).
A question that many are asking. What was missing?
The result is the defeat of the big favorite, who in all previous rounds showed that she has the opportunity to become the new Miss Colombia, and not in vain became the Queen of the police and the most beautiful face of Joile de Volgue. These titles were achieved, for example, by Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who subsequently won the title of Miss Kolumb.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to name her only First Multimiss is the fact that she did not convince by her answer to the question: "Which book did you like the most and why?" posed by Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Murillo G<0xC3><0xB3>mez of the literary editorial office of Leamos.
In response to the candidate’s question, she said:
"I read a lot. I believe very much in the role of literature, I believe it is one of the forms of cultivation. The book that influenced me most in my childhood was "The Little Prince", a very deep book.
I am currently reading "Crime and Punishment". It is a book that is part of the world literature that we should all know. And today I have with me a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian author. This is a wonderful book called "El ardor de la sangre".
This answer was disliked, firstly, because of the term "culturalization" and secondly because the candidate did not explain what the individual books mentioned had done to her.
After the ceremony, Melina said that she was calm and happy with the result: "The world is wise, what is to happen will happen.
And you people, read if you can. The Little Prince is a wonderful book."
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the position of the favorite.
The Bogotá journalist suggested that the candidate had been the most popular, the most celebrated, and the one who had won all previous prizes (the Oster Gastronomy Challenge, the public’s title for the best art dress, and the Queen Mother) from the beginning, aroused the envy of the other candidates, stressing the Queen, who then burned on the stage.
This was evident during the first presentation of the swimwear on Hilton Beach and during two shows before the final coronation.
Although she shone on both of them, it was clear that she lacked the strength and enthusiasm of the representatives from Magdalena and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for Canal RCN’s “At Home” program, believes that Melinda’s winning the title of first multi-miss confirms the fact that the candidate who wins the most titles during the competition ultimately does not leave with the queen’s crown.
In addition, Valle has taken a rather unfriendly attitude towards the media in recent days, and this has not paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Contest.
Just two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doughty said she was looking for a woman who would be aware of her country’s social needs.
"In the Miss Colombia pageant, beauty in itself is not enough, you need to see something more than just physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on social feelings. It is important that candidates are involved in such projects even before they enter the contest," she explained.
It is also speculated that the candidate Valle lost points due to the shortcomings of her background and fibrosis, which was noticeable on the buttocks. But this is completely contrary to the verdict of the jury, who chose her Miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the queens, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls here, "but problems with fibrosis on the buttocks, which in my opinion was not very noticeable, took away her points until the last day."
Meanwhile, Cromos journalist Guido Hoyos believes that the Valle native made a mistake when she underwent several surgical procedures.
"Surgery is fine, but it didn't work in Valle.
The body was never her strong suit, and here she took her toll.”
Because of this award, which was first given by the National Assembly of Beauty, after the swimsuit show, there was a cruel prediction that came true. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo Melina gave, so that he did not have to give her the highest crown in the end.
Whether it is true or not, it is certain that Melina has today begun the year of her reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions, to which she will be appointed by the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite the impressive success in Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
Such was the work of a resident of Cali, who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
The Cali fingerprint expert went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alphonse Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4 last year, a fingerprint expert from the CTI in Cali made history as the man who confirmed the identity of Farc’s supreme leader: “Alfonse Cana,” through a comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working in the CTI department, this week’s was Eliazar González, a man from Puerta Tejada who has been working in forensic research for 21 years.
Early in his career, González worked at Choc<0xC3><0xB3> Town Hall, where he often had to make his way through the forest for more than five days to get to a place where there were corpses that needed to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital Valle, and after completing the relevant courses, he began to specialize in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of skin friction, that is, the palms of the hands and feet.
In the week of the operation against Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
He went to Cauca on a helicopter from Palmyra on Friday night.
He knew that he would have to identify the two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world. Therefore, he was asked to take a card with the fingerprints of Guillermo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigation team at the place where the body was located, he did not recognize it because of its physical appearance.
He had no beard, dressed like a villager in the area, without glasses, much slimmer.
But the prints don't lie.
Along with the gallton magnifying glass, the ink and the transplanter, and the light, Eliazar began to compare the dactyl records of the corpse with the notes from the card.
His eye did not disappoint: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, a Puerto Tejada man was tasked with confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinz<0xC3><0xB3>n, whether or not he was the commander-in-chief of the Farc.
Searching for tracks
The recognition given to Eliazar González by President Juan Manuel Santos at the press conference of the operational service against Cano is very significant for the dactylscope from Si<0xC3><0xAD>n de Cali.
A lot of people don't know our job.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in deciding crimes.
In addition to identifying the corpses, these people help in the investigation of crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When caught, a lot of delinquents present false papers or have no papers at all.
We'll take their fingerprints and search the database.
The investigator said that in the event of an injury, he had to remove a piece of the wall of the house in the house, because at this place the thief leaned to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not designed to be fingerprinted, but in this case we were able to get a full hand print and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts.”
Fingerprints can also confirm or disprove suspicions in the case of murder.
Recently, they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him.
The investigation revealed that one of the family members might have been responsible for the murder, and the print on the bottle actually confirmed it.
Although it cannot be 100% confirmed that he was indeed the killer, it is clear that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
A fingerprint expert at the CTI explained that the items are “erased using chemical or physical reactive substances.”
When they appear, a transplantor or tape is used to collect them.
Then the fingerprints are sent to Asif, which is a database of delinquents, or to the Registry.
“The problem is that there are still many Colombians today whose data is not recorded anywhere,” the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as it appears on the CSI television program.
Like everything that glitters is not gold, not everything that you touch leaves traces.
However, if it can be used, an appropriate comparison must be made.
‘Indignity’ Protests in New York
Hundreds of protesters crowded Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to live.
A large part of them waited for the order to clear the area and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement provoked New York officials on Tuesday as they tried to retake Manhattan Square, from where they were taken out in the morning, following a court order, and then attempted to seize another New York park.
Hundreds of protesters crowded Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get thanks to a court order allowing the "outraged" to return to their posts. The second part of the movement responded to the eviction by taking over a park in the north of the city, where there were further arrests.
“If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle elsewhere and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through gatherings and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the “Occupy Wall Street” movement.
Bray said the "outraged" response to the eviction, which was ordered by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg himself, reached the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the forcible eviction of the site and allowing protesters to continue to reside there.
In addition, another park located at the intersection of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the site of the parish in Trinity Church, took over.
At least for an hour they managed to take the place, but then the police came and detained some of the protesters. Bray did not know the exact number, but said he saw that some journalists were also wearing handcuffs.
The organization says several hundred people have settled on the site, and a delegation of religious leaders has come to express their support and to try to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is privately owned, remains closed and a court hearing is expected to take place on Tuesday, during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the relocated protesters even distributed copies of the court order and even gave them to the officers guarding the square, triggering “some small clashes,” said Bray, who condemned the fact that some police officers beat the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of the Ocupa Wall Street movement or using “laws that were published after the seizure began, or prohibiting protesters from accessing the park with shops or other places they used previously.”
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that due to the court order, the city has suspended the reopening of public space and warned protesters that local laws do not allow them to return their tents and sleeping bags.
The city's top official personally defended the morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which up to 200 people were detained and joined because the protesters were "violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation of the square because it was becoming “a place where people didn’t go to protest but to break laws and in some cases hurt others” because “some shops received threatening letters” and “neighbors worried about the quality of their lives.”
“The early eviction was appalling and shows that Bloomberg is trying to keep financial interests at the expense of the American working people,” a spokesman for the movement added, accusing the mayor of “not respecting freedom of expression.”
Representatives of Ocupa Wall Street also said they plan to organize "big events" on Thursday in cooperation with community and trade union organizations to commemorate the two months of protests that began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson to play the Virgin Mary in Christmas TV special
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the December 1st episode of It's a Russell Peters Christmas.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen’s assistant on “Home Improvement,” a lifeguard on “Baywatch,” a bunny on “Playboy,” the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a special Canadian television Christmas show.
Private television station CTV announced today that Anderson, along with sentimental song singer Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the December 1 episode of "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and will embody the Virgin Mary.
CTV showed footage today of a television program in which Anderson, also known from internet home porn movies, appears with her ex-husband, "M<0xC3><0xB6>tley Cr<0xC3><0xBC>e" engine Tommy Lee, as the Virgin Mary holding a doll representing Jesus in a manger.
As Josef, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Native American origin, appears on the scene, having recently served as a moderator on Charlie Sheen’s “My Violent Torpedo of Truth” tour.
The Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, will appear in a special Christmas CTV broadcast.
Bublé recently called American Kim Kardashian a "few" at one of her concerts in New York.
Japan returns to life after devastating earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to household consumption, ending the period of decline that began in March
Japan’s economy has been paralyzed since March last year and is now recovering from a devastating earthquake that has turned into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has faced since World War II.
The Tokyo government’s first estimates put the material loss at $300,000 million, a blow that is healing well despite the difficult global situation.
After three quarters of declines, the value of GDP between July and September reached such a position that it was possible to turn the page with a definite effect: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% per year.
In addition, the results of the second quarter - for the Japanese, the tax year begins in March 2012 - predict the largest growth rate compared to the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machines that are necessary for the reconstruction of areas destroyed by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Companies increased their investments by 1.1%, spending will fall by 0.9% compared to the period January-March. This is the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on the impulse to use the crisis to get us out of it, or to rebuild the infrastructures, which is to use the lack to start from scratch.
Japan has woken up. Especially thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, thanks to increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
Stigma yen
Flows were placed in the hands of the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "rescue values" for investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the worrying US forecasts. It is a privilege, but it is also a great burden for export companies.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technology groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony attributed their weak results in July and September to the yen exchange rate.
While markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, Yoshihiko Noda’s government is wary.
"We need to be vigilant about the risks that remain, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid increase in the yen," the state secretary for economic policy, Motohisa Furukawa, said in a statement.
In fact, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said most member countries showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which predicts inflexibility in the world economy, has shown that the economy of major powers is slowing down.
It fell four-tenths to 100.4 points from 100.8 in August.
The euro area even fell below the average, which is at the level of 100. It reached the level of 99.13 points.
Athens again spreads uncertainty
Papadimos says austerity measures will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the rapid and risky marginal guarantees and the uncertainty that has once again prevailed, Greece is increasingly entangled in the labyrinth leading to the exit from the great debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the "agreement" of the new transitional Greek government is due to Brussels' demands rather than the true convictions of political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period he was given at the time of his appointment is likely to be short for their application, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, said that the new austerity measures would not in any way support and reiterated his demand for a February 19th date to be called for new elections.
"The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the summit of October 26," Papadimos said yesterday during a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the government.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, a reform of the Disciplinary Code of Officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’s message does not clear up any doubts about his position: “We are committed to helping the transitional government, but we are not committed to anything else.”
The president of the conservatives went a little further in his speech to the EU and the IMF. These organizations are supposed to unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs. At the same time, however, he said that he would not support and will not sign any commitment regarding the implementation of austerity measures.
The European Commission, already angered by the impact Papandreou's referendum games have caused, stressed yesterday that its demands are unsurpassable: it will not unblock any aid unless the new government and the leaders of the main parties sign a "written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that the Troika inspectors would return "very soon" to Athens and would negotiate with the new government "what it needs to pay for the sixth part" of the $8 billion.
Greece has a long way to go yet.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's privileged position in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a significant position at the global level in terms of microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become the second donor of the planet in the last two decades in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which is "that it is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity. It is an instrument based on trust in man".
The Queen yesterday opened the 5th Global Microloan Summit in Valladolid with the belief that there is “no doubt” that this type of operation “is absolutely necessary” in order to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the UN by 2015.
Spain "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and takes this task responsibly", stressed Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and the contribution of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", to whom these loans are primarily intended.
"We have already achieved a lot" and "many challenges are still ahead of us".
The Microloans Summit will not only be a discussion forum, but also a platform to support "core objectives".
Her Majesty explained that the aim is for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and for 100 million families to get above the poverty line under which they currently live.
The concept of microloans spread to Spain and other countries of the world after “the pioneer of the idea of Muhammad Yunus set out on this journey”, the Queen said, adding that it was “an act of justice and the necessary recognition”.
She described the father of the tool as "an admirable idealist who set out on a journey to fight poverty". She got acquainted with his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to get acquainted directly on the spot with his loan policy.
This experience was followed by the first global summit in Washington, D.C., and other meetings such as the 1999 C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire summit in Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings, I was able to note the constant development, explained the Queen, who, thanks to her support for this project, earned yesterday the title of 'head of the family' awarded to her by the 'movements' in Valladolid."
Queen Sofia concluded her speech by inviting participants to engage in discussions and search for solutions to enable them to continue the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
The foreign minister, Trinidad Jiménez, said that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" that must be followed by all democratic states.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries only to the period of balohoby, because this cooperation is a "permanent duty".
Jiménez believes that micro-loans represent a "serious and honest policy to eradicate poverty", and now more than ever, governments in developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to fall victim to cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, welcomed the success that celebrates a concept based on giving confidence to the people to whom everyone else is closing the door. The Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Le<0xC3><0xB3>n de la Riva, welcomed participants in a city that "opens its gates to a spirit of solidarity that is contagious".
CDU proposes to elect a European president on the basis of universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Congress was held in Leipzig on Monday, 14 November, without serious problems for Chancellor and Christian Democratic Party (CDU) leader Angela Merkel.
The question of the future of Europe was not originally on the agenda, but became one only in the autumn, in particular to satisfy party members who consider the government's policy today towards the Greeks, and perhaps tomorrow towards the Italians, to be lax.
The proposal concerning the President of the European Commission submitted by the management was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1,001 delegates were against and 10 delegates abstained.
A few minutes’ standing ovation at the end of Angela Merkel’s speech, and then a few hours later, Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in the slogan: the response to the crisis is "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not just because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
According to the Chancellor, in Europe "the time for change has come".
This could translate into changes in the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage "with the aim of giving Europe one face".
In any case, this is one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by the Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble.
It is certainly unlikely that all 27 countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary step: the UK opposes it, and CDU leaders think Nicolas Sarkozy will take the same stance.
But the direction is set.
Similarly, the delegates rejected by a large majority the proposal to assess the weight of each country on the board of directors of the European Central Bank depending on the weight of its economy, which would obviously result in the strengthening of the weight of Germany.
Driven by concerns about calming the climate within her party, the chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she did not try to win a congress by talking about "small" European states or states that are in trouble, willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the European proposal devotes one paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
Two hundred years ago, a bloody battle was taking place in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is Fraud in Incapacity for Work?
After the support, the UMP and the government launch an offensive against incapacity for work.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 December, to visit the Social Aid Office, where he will deliver a speech on a recurring theme since 2007: fighting social fraud and redistributing solidarity.
As an accompaniment to this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased austerity, but is no less clear from the point of view of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on work incapacity.
First, because of budget savings, the government intends to force private sector employees to work on the fourth day of incapacity before they start taking sick pay.
Clearly, without the company’s consent, an employee who falls ill would lose four days’ wages, i.e. at least 15% of their monthly income.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring in 280 million euros.
And also a measure that would be accompanied by another measure of symbolic scope: to give civil servants one day of unpaid incapacity for work (so far they have no incapacity compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of debate, the right-wing majority also raises the issue of fraud, this time focusing on abuses related to work incapacity.
"The controls will be much more extensive and, moreover, if you are caught, you will be returned," Bertrand told RTL on Sunday.
As in other cases, the effects of notification appear to be somewhat disproportionate to the truth about inequities at work.
These have in fact been the subject of constant surveillance since 2002 and political onslaught that has borne fruit.
The French are no more ill than anywhere else in Europe.
Let’s start with a few official numbers.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Health Research and Documentation, in 2008, daily reimbursements, with their <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion, represented 5% of health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity allowances and accidents at work and 54% concerned incapacity, i.e. <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2 billion.
Only 2.5% of health care costs.
According to a study by Alma Consulting, the average number of days of incapacity for work in France in 2010 was 14.5 days, compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average, which hides some deviations: another survey published in 2007 on the job site Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed answered that they did not choose any day of incapacity.
Another study, this time carried out by sickness insurance institutions, specifies that in 2010 37.8% of incapacity was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months and 11% lasted longer.
When compared with their European neighbours, French workers are no more prone than elsewhere to incapacity for work.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS (National Research Centre) researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001 total absenteeism (for health reasons or not) fluctuated in France between 10% and 11.8% versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in incapacity for work represents only a very small proportion of undeclared work.
As far as fraud is concerned, these are only of a small scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic checks targeting incapacity for work for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM found that at 1.5 million inspections, 13.8% of the 285,000 carried out due to short-term incapacity were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked incapacity for more than 45 days, 11% of cases of "unadjusted or unauthorized" amounted to 1.2 million checks, i.e. 132,000.
A total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases per several million employees who were incapacitated.
A number that represents much less than the number expressing the work on black.
According to UMP MEP Dominique Tian, the author of the June report on this issue, this figure would represent 9 to 15 billion euros missing from the annual tax collection, i.e. more than the total amount of daily refunds and therefore infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new bailout program to rebuild its economy.
On Monday, 14 December, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos spoke before parliament, adding that the 100 days given to his unity government would not be enough to carry out this task.
"To get our economy back on its feet, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget rescue plan," the head of government said as he delivered his first public speech at the start of a confidence vote in parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken on October 27 at the eurozone summit will be the “main task” of the new government, since our country’s participation in the eurozone is at stake, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos assumed that the country's public deficit would be "around 9%" of gross domestic product between now and the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Rights rejects new austerity measures
Right-wing leader Antonis Samaras on Monday voiced his support for the measures already approved to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party was not committing to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," Samaras said at a meeting with MPs for his New Democracy party.
We have agreed on targets for deficit and debt reduction and the fight against waste, but we are against any policy that would prevent an economic recovery.
To Mr Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without a written guarantee from all parties supporting the envisaged measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized, says panel of experts
According to a report by the Royal Canadian Society, Canadians are denied death.
In the matter of palliative care, the Commission urges governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Canadian society lives by the idea of denying death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the opportunity to talk to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die, and make decisions in this sense.
This is one of the conclusions of an extensive report by the Royal Canadian Society, which involved six experts working in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The commission recommends that the government amend the criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if the choice appears necessary in a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the beginning, experts cite a recent survey by the independent agency the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death."
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society tell us.
And despite the desire to die at home, which most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average applies to the whole of Canada, while in the province of Quebec this figure is highest with 86% of people dying in hospital.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reach conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change anything about the criminal law concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts who have also scrutinised all countries where these approaches are legalised or not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this decriminalisation causes any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide to persons who are incompetent or disagree.
Jocelyn Downie, the report’s co-author, confirmed more than a dozen cases of the disorder in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legal.
“Euthanasia is also performed in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.”
“Assisted suicide is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are in favor of euthanasia.
Recall that according to an investigation conducted by the Angus Reid Forum in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favor of euthanasia, because they believe that it will allow people at the end of life to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia won’t mean we’re sending the message that the lives of old or disabled people are worth less.
As for people who practice assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
In the matter of maintaining or interrupting patient care, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also propose that the list of their recommendations should state in criminal law that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not a criminal offence.
The Commission of Experts also requires that medical professionals be educated to respect the obligation to refuse treatment at the end of life without fear of criminal prosecution.
In the matter of palliative care, the Commission urges governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Finally, in the matter of palliative or final relief already widely used in Canadian health facilities, the Commission requests that it be considered, when it is no longer used to reduce physical pain, to be euthanasia and to be subject to the same procedures.
Comments from other experts
Some medical law experts have already expressed their reservations regarding the conclusions of the Royal Canadian Society’s expert report.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified the position of expert-signatories of the report as "extreme" among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to the sick in the final stage.
“This opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of life and who would be over 18 years old could ask to be helped to commit suicide,” says Pierre Deschamps, who studied the summary of the report yesterday.
Deschamps also stresses that it seems as if the authors of the report put the autonomy of the person above all other values that form the social thread of society.
Because "in society, he says, there are warning signs and limitations."
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as a "manifesto for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Canadian Society, particularly doubts the report’s data regarding the absence of wrongdoing in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalised, i.e. the Netherlands and the U.S. state of Oregon.
Jordan's King Urges President Assad to Resign
Damascus talks about "complication"
Syria is increasingly isolated.
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure intensified on Syria of President Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists them and talks about "complication" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria’s membership in the Arab League, the European Union has stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, countries neighbouring Syria, took a stand in favor of President Assad’s departure.
Jordan’s King Abdullah II was the first ruler of an Arab state to call on President Bashar al-Assad to “give up power” in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the regime’s military forces have been killed.
"If Bashar had his country's interests at heart, he would have had to resign, but he would also have had to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," Jordan's king said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that efforts to mediate with the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been crowned with success.
"Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to neighboring Syria, against which Turkey is drawing an increasingly hard line.
The United States welcomed the “strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the Syrian regime’s dishonest behavior” following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
“The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries like Turkey are applying an increasingly harsh tone” to the repression in Syria, Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Toner said.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 16 civilians and 19 members of pro-regime forces were killed in the southern Syrian city of Deraa.
According to the NGO, two other civilians were killed "in shootings and concentrated shootings from heavy machine guns in the town of Jobar" in the Homs region.
However, during a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country "went out of the crisis."
He was also quick to respond to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus’s membership, which he said was a “dangerous step.”
Syria "will not bow", he added, with the assurance that "complexes spun against Syria will not succeed".
Following its decision to suspend Syria’s membership, the Arab League is currently considering a “civilian protection mechanism” and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe is also sympathetic to the idea of sending UN monitors to help protect civilians from reprisals by a regime he says is acting "paranoidly".
A new special meeting of the League is being convened tomorrow in Rabat to take a position on the crisis resolution plan decided on 2 December, which envisaged in particular the withdrawal of armies from conflict-ridden cities and the release of imprisoned demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the decision of the Arab League "wrong" on Tuesday, while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, while completely avoiding support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy's
Monti demands time and sacrifice for Italy
The next head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for a little time to form his team and start implementing a program that will include "victims" in order to regain the credibility lost in recent months of Berlusconi's government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with political parties yesterday before meeting with representatives of trade unions and employers today.
He should form a relatively slender cabinet composed of technocrats from non-parliamentary parties.
“Monti talked about an important programme with many victims,” said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting the prime minister.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini expects Mario Monti to ask parliament for a vote of confidence on Friday to make sure the new government has enough support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti introducing a small team of 12 ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Mario Monti commented yesterday on the nervousness in the financial markets and asked for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" for the preparation of the government and its program, he stressed, adding that he was "confident that the markets will be patient and understand".
His appointment as president was initially welcomed by markets, but concerns have resurfaced after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro zone in September.
The prime minister-designate should put together a team that includes mainly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to accept "politics" into it.
He expressed confidence that the new government will last until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next elections.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive the confidence of parliament by Friday.
After taking office, Mario Monti promised to act with extraordinary urgency and with the aim of making Italy “a strong member” of Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change."
The European Union is convinced that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its goal of a balanced budget in 2013 and is calling for new tough measures.
Confindustria boss Emma Marcegagli, who will meet with Monti on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy "because a country that is not showing growth cannot keep to deficit parameters."
Mario Monti, a former European Commissioner (1994-2004), recognized for his expertise and independence, the "professor" symbolising, according to the authors of the editorials, the "challenge to seriousness" and "another Italy", represents for Italy an "epochal change" after 17 years of "berlusconism".
The length of his team's life will be a big unknown.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy has until April 2012 to place state bonds worth 200 billion euros.
Soviet Scientist Helps Iran's Nuclear Program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator that could be used for nuclear weapons, a U.S. non-governmental organization specializing in nuclear risks said on Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked by the UN agency to identify the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA said it was "gravely concerned" about the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to the Institute of ISIS widely drawing on IAEA documents, V. Danilenko (born 1934) was supposed to work for three decades from the 1960s at the Soviet military research center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he was supposed to deal with the production of synthetic diamonds by the method of explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he was supposed to leave the center to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company should have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before his return to Russia, he was supposed to cooperate from 1996 to 2002 on the Iranian program.
In its latest report, the IAEA recalls "clear evidence that the development of the detonation system by Iran" was based "on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who - as one member state informed the agency - worked for a substantial part of his working career on this technology within the military nuclear program of the country of origin".
Anti-Muslim crime and delicts increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics released on Monday, the number of crimes and offenses against Muslims rose by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence declined slightly or rose little.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. a 49% increase over the 13% increase in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in offences against Jews and an overall increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and delicts.
The total number of “hate crimes” rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
“Following the decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these criminal acts and torts rise again,” Human Rights First, a human rights organization, said in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, one of the group’s leaders.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses,” he adds, estimating that this could be done by improving police reporting of “hate crimes.”
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the Civil Rights era.
This legal order was enacted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, color, religion, descent, and now sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and it’s more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter introduced design changes on Monday to allow its users to observe the activities of successors, somewhat likening its services to Facebook.
The new "action" and "name" offers allow you to better and directly know the activities of other people who follow you or whose replies ("tweets") you follow.
This lets you know whether they allow you to track posts, whether they sign up for new accounts, whether they have favorite posts, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested “in August on a small percentage of users” before being rolled out to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for the repeated dissemination of someone else's post, followfriday pour recommender de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainde a public des cel<0xC3><0xA8>uni<0xC3><0xA8>n avec.
On the network, users immediately in their "tweets" differently assess the importance of this innovation.
“It’s unnecessary, it takes up a lot of space, and it’s too much like Facebook,” <0x40>jemb123 wrote.
“The Activity feature will help me better track some elements of my Twitter feed,” <0x40>dannykronstrom wrote.
AUSTRIA
The Golden Rule of Balanced Budgeting in the Constitution
The government of Austria's ruling coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats decided on Tuesday to write a "golden rule" of budgetary policy into the constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible downgrade of Austria's rating by rating agencies (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the end of the ministerial meeting in a situation where Austria’s public debt, with its 74.6%, is well above the Maastricht criterion of a maximum of 60%, but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency were reduced by just one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more in interest each year,” argued the vice chancellor and foreign minister, Christian Democrat Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is therefore following up on the request of the Euro Summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where Heads of State and Government strongly requested that by the end of 2012 the reduction of the public deficit and the achievement of a balance of public accounts be enshrined in the Constitution or in a law of equal value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is close to the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and starting in 2017, the federal government’s public structural deficit will not be allowed to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the federal states as well as municipalities will have to report a balanced budget.
The aim is to bring public debt below the 60% criterion set out in the Maastricht Treaty in the 2020/21 horizon.
Strong only
Noda threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again in foreign exchange markets if he were to continue strengthening.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we find too much volatility" in the yen's exchange rate, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, it only rose again to the historic values that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo was selling yen for dollars in order to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which only recently surpassed the record against the dollar in force since 1945.
But only since then has it regularly risen backed by purchases by investors who see it as a “safe haven” in uncertain times of global economic slowdown and the European debt crisis.
The dollar again fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen to near the levels that triggered the latest intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth about 120 yen and the euro was more than 160 yen.
This flare-up of the Japanese currency is hurting island exports, as it increases the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of revenue earned by Japanese companies from abroad when they convert them into domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering" from the devastation caused by the March earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region in the northeast of the country, stressed Y. Noda, who is afraid that this increase in the price of the yen will not kill the fragile recovery in the egg.
The world’s third-largest economy resumed growth in the third quarter (1.5% compared to the previous quarter) for the first time in a single year, thanks to a survey of the growth of exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the prime minister concluded that the high value of the yen did not reflect “Japan’s national economy.”
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution’s senior vice governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, said the BoJ had already taken “appropriate measures” suggesting that no additional currency weakness could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Securities Issuance Institute increased its purchases of Treasury bills by 5,000 billion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>47 billion) to 55,000 billion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>519 billion) and raised the ceiling of the amounts it devotes to purchases of various securities to flood liquidity.
Eurozone:
Prices are rising, the stock market is failing.
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis continues to undermine European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth numbers in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to rise.
European stock exchanges, still concerned about the stability of the euro area, are falling into negative expectations today, Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax index is down 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
“With new tensions surrounding the distressed loan yields of euro area countries, equity markets around the world continue to account for only a fraction of recent gains.”
“Nervous investors are just too aware of the risk of contagion,” Terry Pratt, a broker at IG Markets, told Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a 0.7% drop, which suffered due to concerns from market participants about Europe's ability to cope with the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes fixed on Europe, and the exchange will continue only in a narrow corridor of variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This restart of uncertainty about the future of the euro zone is hurting the currency itself, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570 at a 0.4% retreat.
According to the brokers, the currency backed away after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU party adopted a proposal at its congress on Monday suggesting the possibility of leaving the euro zone for countries that find themselves in trouble without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds is 6.85% and the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting the interest rates of southern European countries, but also in France, continue to heighten the concerns of market participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, strongly demanded time in the markets to correct the situation in Italy threatened by the poisoning caused by the amount of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, has confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on October 27 at the eurozone summit will be "the main task" of his government.
Spain is once again in a deliberate straight line of markets as the country holds parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The spread between the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new historical maximum.
In anticipation of the figures announcing the growth of the euro area
Statistics show that France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, mainly due to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected growth of 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) revised down the figures for the second quarter to a decline of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And, in fact, it is the fourth quarter that economists are most concerned about.
For its part, Germany recorded growth of 0.5% during the same period.
The first euro zone-wide forecasts are expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must triumph over dogmas.
If there is a topic that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balance sheets or under emotions, then it is energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is natural that the election meeting should be an opportunity to think about such deposits and about the place that takes energy from the core.
The debate will be successful only if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are explored.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
There are 7 billion human beings on the planet so far, but demographic developments will trigger a doubling of electricity demand by 2050 if we do not want to deprive a significant part of the world’s population of an important part of life.
At the same time, the lack of fossil resources will have to be tackled in order to continue producing electricity, while not forgetting the necessary need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, a subject that is currently disappearing from environmental debates.
The Fukushima accident does not affect any of these parameters.
And that is why Germany alone remains in its decision to refuse nuclear energy.
But this is not the case in Belgium, which submits its decision to find some other source capable of replacing itself, nor in Switzerland, which considers it right to build only power plants of the last generation.
On the contrary, the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue with determination in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its fleet by one unit by restoring the construction of one power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island power plant accident.
If the German model based on renewable energy is ever presented as an example, reality contradicts it.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the price of electricity, increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, and a sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and coal power plants.
All these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves to be considered.
The European champion in wind power, which accounts for 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind irregularities, which is why CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher, respectively, than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbours will pay an electricity bill 40% higher than the payment of French households.
While in a globalised economy, energy costs are a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining industry on national territory, French businesses enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would cause a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory beautiful statements about the re-industrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
The price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay, just as they do not fundamentally oppose this energy, as polls show.
Recall that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build a sector with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 downstream jobs.
A highly-exporting sector brings a large number of small and medium-sized specialised firms to international markets, creating jobs that cannot be transferred abroad.
If France decided to leave the core, it would sacrifice a considerable number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and lose <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion a year that the country receives for exporting nuclear equipment and services.
Which power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to operate for 60 years while its manufacturer is scheduled to go bankrupt?
When solving the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magical source for energy production, let alone that there is no diabolical one.
The development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable energy equipment by the French industrial group AREVA demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is an absolute necessity to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which carries out uncompromising and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of safety in their blood.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry has suffered three major accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island took place under normal operating conditions and was left without human casualties and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the drama was caused by reactor concepts and inexcusable human errors.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident as it did from the previous two.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and designers, is that the EPR reactor is a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all those who wish to build a nuclear power plant consider it, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift to AREVA’s and EDF’s competitors and pave the way for them to seize a leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations dominate a debate so crucial to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy pursued under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from different angles – the overcrowding of the police, the courts and the administration subjected to the numbering policy, the compatibility of this policy with the status of a “country of human rights” that France boasts of.
Recently, it was an administrative harassment targeting foreign students, which became topical when the interior minister (see the newspaper Libération of 23 May) declared that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and waitresses".
But so far, it has rarely been dissected from an economic angle.
It must be said that there is a fairly broad consensus between the left and the right in this area.
To the right, Jacques Chirac said in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where there are 2 million immigrant workers" and to the left, Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France "cannot accept all the misery of the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of an invasion by hordes of Polish plumbers into French territory was shared right and left.
In both camps, immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity we are willing to give to immigrants.
In his program, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande limits himself to banalities, stating that joint development will allow us to solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may apply in elections, but it is very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in their recently published paper synthesizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.): among specialists there is a broad consensus on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth.
Reducing immigration is crippling growth and damaging employment.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially the less skilled, and create pressure to reduce their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more of a complement than substitutes for French workers by performing jobs in sectors with a shortage of workers.
Low-skilled immigrants in sectors that do not attract French workers, and those most skilled in dynamic sectors where education is insufficient to supply jobs.
Positive Impact on Wages
Just as a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, these additions between Frenchmen and migrants cause the arrivals of immigrants to have a positive impact on the wages and employment of French workers.
Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migration movements would cause real wages to rise between 0.6% and 0.9% in the long run.
And it does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to thought formation and economic growth (the high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay, and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries, with an average of 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organisation estimates that in Germany, one migrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 to public budgets in his or her lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy, at the beginning of his term in office, expressed the wish to reach for the missing percentages of growth "with prized teeth".
The teeth used to deter immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe Invented Democracy, European Democracy Remains to Be Rethought
Democracy is a rare commodity and a very fragile commodity.
The European continent should remember this, because despite the fact that it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, it experienced during the 20th century the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the gulags, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece.
Some people might have believed that in order for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be enough to make a choice and carry it out in the most direct way possible.
However, it is known from Napoleon that it was about ease of thinking.
Universal suffrage, while a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can become an “instrument of oppression,” as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of separation and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it has been the same since the beginning of the crises of politics and democracy.
Admitting the error of a Greek yes-no referendum will have the value of a double revelation in this regard: the revelation of the need for a major return of political power, but also the revelation of a disturbing sense of its impossibility, of its inadequacy.
This ambivalence must be considered in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer firing in the right direction.
We can get nothing if we demand a series of national referenda, organised as necessary and disorganised.
Bianca exposed to a European absolute monarch or a bound-footed leap into the void of nationalist depth: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want guillotine knives, but a common, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we would not even know where to stop - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is bowing to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, which is suffering from its incapacity and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is being humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it each of its peoples.
The management of the European project of democratic sovereignty must be restored as a matter of urgency.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, get rid of the government of the markets and prepare the future by investing.
The way out of the crisis will presuppose decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to disaster.
After long fighting against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today is strongly demanding a European economic government.
Yes, I am.
But to think this without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such by citizens, would be a new folly and a new dead end.
We need to take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to establish a republic in France, it was necessary to "be" republicans.
A revolution in the interests of the people could not be enough.
This lesson continues.
We need to build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This can only be done by building a more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards are spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere, the world fair of smart cards will open on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris.
According to the Eurosmart cabinet, 2011 should end with an increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM-card phones) by 11% to more than 6 billion units.
The most significant is the segment of contactless technology, which allows you to pay in public transport or make purchases by simply approaching the card to the reader.
This year, 460 million smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, up from 320 million a year earlier.
Their share is expected to rise further in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and reach approximately 10% of the total chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Having been in the tow of APEC countries for a long time, Europe is gaining ground in contactless payment.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards were issued.
But large retail chains work for two.
Carrefour has released 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to get a higher gear, banks need to equip their clients with them from now on.
“Two large French companies have committed to systematically distributing contactless bank cards to their clients in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only the first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Today, only a small number of devices are equipped with Near Field Communication (NFC).
"They're running late."
"But their real expansion should take place next year."
“For 2012, we estimate their sales in the world at 80 to 120 million units,” explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But banks are already preparing ahead.
Crédit Agricole Bank announced yesterday the launch of a test in the city of Caen, which will last from December to June next year.
iPhone devices of approximately 200 clients and co-workers will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Generale announced yesterday that it is preparing to introduce an offer allowing its clients to pay by mobile phone without touch.
The terrorist front stretches from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about ties between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing suspicions that there are ties between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria’s Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria had “gained certainty” from now on.
“The way the two organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is a lot of cooperation between them,” he said.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help shed light on the connecting bridges.
After being kidnapped by AQMI members from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day at the same time as several of their captors in an operation carried out by special French units.
In the rubble after the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several phones with chips belonging to terrorists.
The Terrorist Axis
Analysis of the calls made leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two figures: one leads to a Nigerian who has been in Maiduguri for a long time, a city in northern Nigeria that is the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man said to be close to AQMI and the sect.
“It’s progress, but there is no doubt that we need to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian investigator.
In recent months, this "support" has become more and more evident in Boko Haram's development and speeches or in its operational procedures, which now include human casualties or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same design as those used by AQMI.
The international community, led by Washington, has since put pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened mystics of little interest.
Fast success
The Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in Haoussa language means "Western education is a sin", approves the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection has rapid success.
The sect is politicized and requires strict adherence to Islamic sharia law, while its adherents launch a fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars, and offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram supporters became extremely active and multiplied their attacks against police stations.
As usual, the government’s response remains the same.
The army encircles the city, resulting in 800 deaths.
The founder of the sect, Mohammed Yusuf, is captured and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has been radicalized and is leaving its place of work in the north.
On Christmas Day 2010 in the city of Jos, an assassination attempt kills 80 people, then another in the capital Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack the police headquarters in its first suicide attack.
And in August, the local UN office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, worries all security specialists from now on.
Now that al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has encircled Mali and the games and Somalis of the al-Shabaab movement are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new threat to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, during an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé said France was on alert and ready to "hand over all information".
The World According to Presidential Candidates
On issues related to China, Iran, or helping Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are vying for simplicity and ignorance.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, manage the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
When you listen to presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been repeating the loud statements and brief instructions on foreign policy that has traditionally been a strong point for Republicans.
Often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran and aid to Israel blend together.
Mitt Romney, the top-ranked candidate in the race for the Republican “Grand Old Party” nomination, has threatened to call the Chinese ahead of the World Trade Organization and accuse them of “manipulating their currency,” a major issue in America fueled by the migration of entire parts of its industry to Asia.
Worse still, if this must involve starting a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with any sophisticated foreign-policy vision, was almost bogged down in an attitude that “smooths” emotions.
He demanded a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (President Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who is in the last places in the election estimates, remains unresponsive.
The Image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program.
“If elected, I will imprison Iran,” he said in a fanfare speech.
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, demonstrates an embarrassing ignorance of documents.
He recently called for a tough stance against China’s military threat because Beijing is “trying to develop nuclear capabilities” – apparently unaware of the fact that China has owned a nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to send the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and other candidate Michele Bachmann.
All of them are far different than Republican candidate John McCain was in 2008, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president say Reagan also had simple ideas and still won the Cold War.
Obama himself was an amateur and added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They emphasize the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of the "boys" from Iraq, his excuses regarding Libya, and thus attribute to him the label of a weak
But the attack is not easy.
The population views the national security policy of President Obama, who removed Ben Laden, rather positively.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in the military interventions that lead to the impoverishment.
And with the argument that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically in order to resuscitate its leadership, Obama is knocking on the right place.
Nord Stream, a new port of entry for Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Eastern Europe directly to Russia and runs along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has begun to operate.
It must supply gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to properly celebrate this event.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that will connect Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have turned together the control valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion additional cubic meters of Russian gas will flow annually to Western Europe via the 1,224 km long pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region with the federal state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
The second pipeline, due to be completed at the end of 2012, will allow a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas to be supplied, an amount equal to the entire French consumption.
And it is already recalled the possibility of building a third pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge construction has the character of a victory.
Poland and the Baltic states strongly protested against the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will make it possible to supply gas directly to Germany without being routed by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are losing a bit of power: the ability to pressure Russia with threats to close its access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
Warsaw expressed this most strongly when it did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream to the “new German-Soviet pact”, with reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means to say that this is a politically sensitive topic.
Western Europe, through its support for this Russian project, has gained greater confidence in its purchases.
But this is at the cost of weakening Europe’s energy, because the project has created rifts between Europeans from the east and the west.
Just five years ago, Russia managed to assert its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, gas-consuming Western countries whose deposits are nearing their end.
"This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically connects us," Fillon said at the opening ceremony, demonstrating the extent to which large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the wide smiles of Gazprom’s leaders present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas supply point.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical act.
The submarine pipeline is made of steel with a concrete casing to protect it from the anchors of sea vessels.
It rests at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from the Second World War.
“For security reasons, almost a hundred of them had to be removed or destroyed,” said Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing as much as 242 Eiffel Towers, which is not interrupted anywhere in its entire length by either valves or maintenance stations.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project leaders rejected it when the Swedes were only a little eager to see Russian state society settle permanently off their coast.
“In the event of a malfunction, we will stop the gas flow in less than 1 minute,” says Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
In the event of leakage, the gas contained in the pipeline escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builder, because the welds were designed to leak once every 100,000 years.
The condition of the pipeline from the outside is checked by an underwater robot towed by a ship, while the inside of the pipeline is checked by a device that circulates inside.
This cigar-shaped device with a diameter of 1 meter is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is pushed by gas.
At the finish line, after a full three days of travel at a speed of 3 m/s, it will provide accurate information on possible deformations of metal parts.
The long-distance gas pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without the slightest need for repair.
The gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the finish.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
The leading position remains held by Gazprom, which holds a 51% stake.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5 % each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies set up a joint venture called Nord Stream to build and operate the pipeline.
The company is headquartered in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased to this company for five years a contract that can be renewed, all of its capacity for gas transportation.
“Gazprom will profit from the total capacity, no matter how much gas is actually transported,” says Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline was secured by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works should reach 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For the GDF Suez Group, investment costs have risen to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that their costs will be reimbursed, since only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline rises from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy coast with pine forests.
Valves 4.5 meters high form the gas outlet gate.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - Brand Notebook
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded fifty years ago, wants to once again provide the joy of writing.
It brings the scent of adventure, hours spent writing by candlelight.
Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable by its black rectangular plates and its leaves faded white color as if aged over time.
After all, the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
At that time, the Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided to launch a new design, but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, takes over the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (imitation of leather), which is used, for example, for the surface treatment of benches.
This type of notebook was greatly appreciated by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has returned to the old and forgotten subject that was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand’s leader at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose 26% to settle at 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is remote from the secret production from the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to draw any artificial portrait of the buyer, because the notebook will attract a businessman as well as a student or professionals.
Moleskine’s image is that its owners are cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded people.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its beginnings, today has almost a hundred and since 2008 has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He sent his notebooks to bookstores and through the FNAC chain of stores to small boutiques in the middle of cities where he could assert his identity.
“We have been following the spirit of the times and this need for new writing, despite the stormy development of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskine notebook: the brand has recently opened the exhibition "Zacházka", where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival, she also introduced new notebooks resembling a leopard.
Moleskine capitalizes on its success and this cultural aura and diversified its products: bags, diaries, pencils, laptop cases... The brand is expanding to a whole range of carriers.
An enviable success: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by investment funds from SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine history.
Why is there such a high proportion of unemployed disabled workers?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
Today opens the 15th week for the employment of the disabled.
Despite the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% compared to 9% for the entire population.
Is it depressing?
"No," says <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, CEO of the Adapt Association, which organizes the Week for Employing People with Disabilities.
"The progress achieved in 15 years is remarkable."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice as high, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, there is still much to be done."
It must be said that there are numerous obstacles for unemployed disabled persons before they can get to work.
These are the elderly: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% do not have a high school diploma and out of 2.3 million university students, only 10,000 are disabled.
And finally - long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria that make it particularly difficult to return to work and which constitute the "core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, CEO of the Tremplin Association, which was established in 1992 to help businesses recruit disabled workers.
So much for objective brakes.
It remains unsaid, ways of thinking that are certainly evolving, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité association found that interviewed managers had a "poor level of knowledge about disabled people" with "exaggerated notions of wheelchair users and mental or mental disabilities".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the target of employing 6% of disabled workers set by the 1987 law.
The last known figures, which come from 2008, give a state of 2.6%.
“We are now at around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, an organisation charged with collecting fees from businesses that do not comply with the law.
This is evidenced by the number of "penalty" businesses, as well as the amounts paid, which dropped from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 million to 480 million euros) between 2007 and 2011.
“The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses,” explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What luck"
Before the French national team (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match will bring them.
We will not go so far as to write that there was an alliance between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reconciled.
Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in the match against Turkey, the Belgian coach spoke only words of praise to his player.
“I am very pleased with Eden and his progress, and the fact that he loves his country.”
"I want to move forward," says the French Lille player.
As for the difference between his performances in club matches and national team matches, "it's one and the same, it's justified."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clear my mark."
Gambled against Romania on Thursday night for this match against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "glow".
The term “joy” cannot be ignored.
Play against Bleus, whom he encouraged from the age of 7 and in their winning campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a fan,” he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" character of this meeting.
All the more so because across the street are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami),” she recalls.
"We crossed at once."
"To be able to play against them, that's just a pleasure!"
Leekens also kindly reminded us of "pride."
"Pride" to fight"game - holiday".
"Pride" also notes the quality of "neighbors" that France just over a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna "again became a team of very high level".
"Laurent Blanc did a great job," he gasped.
Although Belgium will be missing at the next European Championship, the technical footballer would like to see in 2014 on a plane with the French direction... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians are going to be big," he said.
“We’re building something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You'll realize that for the next games," including against France.
Portugal very self-confident
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento is starting with great optimism a barrage against Bosnia Bosnia (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
On the way there, both teams lacked realism.
“At the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of doubt. The Portuguese national football team, whose helm is since 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes away from happiness.
There is only one match left to play and one opponent - Bosnia.
Knowing Friday's score (0-0) in hell of Bosnian Zenica, it seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour of superiority, but was not able to give such a rare goal that would relieve him.
“It’s a good result, but it’s a risk because we didn’t score outside.”
But at home on their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are confident that they will advance to the audience that should create a boiling cauldron there, even though the match certainly seems to be “very balanced,” says the optimist, but brightly-minded Bento.
“We expect a very balanced match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have the upper hand,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012," Carlos Queiroz's successor said.
Friday's draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A draw may be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
“It’s a good result, but it’s a risk because we didn’t score outside,” Bento said.
“We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and has players with great individual qualities.”
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will be interested in exerting maximum pressure on the Bosnian team right from the start, so as not to "give them time to think."
A good idea, provided it turns out to be realistic this time.
