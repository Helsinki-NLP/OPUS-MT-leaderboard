Members of the Welsh Assembly fear they will “look like Muppets”
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are dismayed by the suggestion that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament)
The proposal is based on plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that the name could cause ridicule.
One Labour member said his group was concerned that "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For non-Wales readers: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A member on Plaid's side said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh conservative said his group was approaching the name change “with an open mind”, but noted that MWP was close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The assembly’s committee, which is now preparing legislation to introduce name changes, said: “The final decision on how members of the Welsh assembly will be named will, of course, be up to the members themselves.”
A 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, where the option of calling the Assembly the Welsh Parliament gained wide support.
As for the title of Assembly members, the committee preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP variant received the most support in public debate.
Members of the assembly are apparently proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus may worry President Elin Jones, who is due to table a bill in a few weeks.
Reform laws will include further changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules for disqualification of members and a draft system of committees.
Members of the Assembly will vote on the issue of their title as part of the discussion of new legislation.
Macedonians will vote on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether their country's name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote should resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to Greek territory, and has repeatedly protested against the country’s EU and NATO membership bids.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change plebiscite, said he would not follow the vote.
Proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the price of joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells fall silent as churches in Harlem struggle to survive
“The old people I talked to said there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr. Adams says.
"There's no one there today."
The disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People are meeting in a different way today," he says.
"The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly go."
As for churches, he fears that the money from the sale of the property will not be enough for as long as their representatives expect, “and sooner or later they will be exactly where they started.”
Churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of this type of people, which will not help the remaining sanctuaries in the district.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white,” he says, “and that’s why the day will soon come when these churches will close completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into apartments will become members of churches.”
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis—the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black congregation whose devotions were held nearby.
St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping boulevard, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners were planning to rebuild it, they also ordered a bell-tower.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bell-tower "the bells of the poor."
The expert, who played the bell-tower in July, called it a “cultural treasure” and an “irreplaceable historical instrument.”
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first bell-ringing in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell-ringing in a church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says no one replaced him at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, a complicated story of architects and builders took place at St. Martin’s, some of whom were summoned by the lay representatives of the church, others by the episcopal diocese.
In July, the Council of Elders – the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay representatives – sent a letter to the diocese expressing concern that the diocese would “try to pass on the costs” to the elders, although the latter did not take part in the hiring of architects and builders sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy in California after diving for lobster
According to official reports, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy in California on Saturday as he was diving for lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy call for help and then paddled to help him out of the water with the whole group.
Hammel said he first considered the call to be the joy of catching a lobster, but then “he realized he was screaming ‘He bit me!
He bit me!’”
When Hammel reached the boy, he noticed that "he had torn the entire area of the clavicle."
“I shouted to everyone to come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken in critical condition by helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego.
It is not known what kind of shark is behind the attack.
The pilot, Captain Larry Giles, told a news conference that the shark had been spotted in the area weeks ago, but was determined not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper torso.
Authorities have closed access to the beach for 48 hours, from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury’s wants to stand up to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty aisles where specialist saleswomen will be available.
As part of the strong launch of the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion cosmetics market in the UK and growing further, while sales of fashion and household goods are falling, the cosmetics aisles will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will expand to other stores next year if successful.
The investment in cosmetics is linked to supermarkets’ efforts to find uses for shelves that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s says it will double the size of its cosmetics offering to 3,000 products and will also launch brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees brands will also get more space thanks to brand locations similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its range of Boutique makeup, so most products will be vegan, which young customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, two Saintsbury’s stores will test the concessions of Fragrance Shop, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south of London, and the second will open this year at Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Online shopping and the shift towards daily shopping for small amounts of food in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe says stores will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to better offer services and non-food products to combat discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury’s has opened hundreds of Argos stores and has also established a number of Habitat departments, chains it bought two years ago, which have increased food sales and made acquisitions even more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to remake the department with a cosmetic and pharmacy assortment ended infamously.
At the beginning of the millennium, Sainsbury’s tested a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after a dispute over the distribution of proceeds from the sale of drugs in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s sold its 281 pharmacies three years ago for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds chain of pharmacies.
Lloyds plans to play its part by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands to four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director, Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve changed the look and style of our beauty aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues with whom customers will be able to consult.
Our range of brands should satisfy all needs, and the enticing environment and convenient location mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics that changes the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
'Dragons' star Peter Jones 'frightens' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulls out of $11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of home clothing and accessories, Truly.
The couple's business has been compared to actress Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of the show announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has enraged Dragons Day star Peter Jones by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute – to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones was reportedly "angry" when the TV star admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at his business empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to new contracts - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - he would no longer be able to devote enough time to their clothing and accessories brand, Truly.
The venture has been likened to actress Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and could double the fortune of presenter Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When thirty-seven-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones set off from Britain to one of his summer residences.
The source said: “The Truly brand was a top priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, which would secure her for several decades to come.
Her decision to leave shocked everyone involved.
No one on Tuesday could believe what was happening, the launch was so close.
There's a warehouse full of merchandise ready for sale at Marlow headquarters."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of the show This Morning, which is one of the most profitable British stars, could cost the company millions due to the heavy investment in products from pillows and candles to clothes and home clothes and possible further delay in the launch of the brand.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Tary Capp in 2016, and Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become the brand ambassador for M&S, replacing Ante McPartlin when she hosts I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business matters.”
Difficult Action “And Then We Fell in Love”
He joked about the criticism he gets from journalists for a remark some consider “unworthy of the president” and for how positively he speaks about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump responded with his mocking “voting” voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that after their June first meeting in Singapore, Trump appreciated as a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea, Kim is interested in another meeting.
But negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a “responsive response” to its first steps toward disarmament.
Instead, the US is continuing sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
In his speech, Trump expressed a much more optimistic view.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
It would cost millions of lives.
We have a great relationship now.”
His efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results, including the end of missile tests, the release of hostages, and the return of the remains of U.S. troops to their homeland.
And he defended his unusual approach to communicating his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 outsiders trying to get into this crowded arena, we’d have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs learned that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been driven out of their homes, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is a bit difficult,” Ms. Sumbung says.
The Save the Children organization is putting together a team that will travel to Palu, but it is not yet clear whether foreign personnel can work there.
A spokesman for the National Disasters Agency, Mr Sutupo, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Paul to see if international organisations would be allowed to help.
Given that earthquakes occur very often in Indonesia, the country is still woefully unprepared for the wrath of Mother Nature.
Tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, but this is not common on other parts of the coast.
The apparent lack of sirens warning of a tsunami in Paul probably contributed to the loss of human lives, even though the warning was issued.
Even at the best of times, traveling between the many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in natural disasters, logistics are even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which docked in Lombok and helped earthquake victims, is now moving to Paul, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new calamity.
Improving Indonesia’s poor infrastructure was a major focus of President Joko Widodo’s election campaign, and the president spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
He will seek re-election next year, but his government is plagued by funding shortfalls.
President Joko also faces pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, with members of the Muslim majority adopting a more conservative form of faith.
Street fighting between Christians and Muslims, in which gangs use machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons, has already claimed the lives of more than a thousand people and driven tens of thousands from their homes.
Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool has scored a goal against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London, saving Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge was given a passport by Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres outside the Chelsea gate when his team lost 1–0.
He swung the ball to his left and fired at a distant pole.
The missile was flying high and headed for the upper right corner of the gate.
The ball eventually jumped over the bouncing Kepu Arrizabalaga and ended up in the net.
“I was just trying to get to the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far ahead as possible, so I wanted to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told Liverpool FC.com.
"I saw Kante coming toward me, so I didn't think much about it, and I fired at one touch."
Chelsea led 1-0 after Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward sent the passport back to Mateo Kovacic, then turned around in the middle of the pitch and sprinted to half of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball.
Then he sent the ball down a beautiful alleyway to Hazard in the lime.
He fled on defense and ended up with a left-hander to a distant pole next to Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
At 15:00 on Wednesday, Liverpool will face the local team in the Champions League group stage at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play on Thursday at 3pm in London with Videoton in the UEFA European League.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832
Indonesia's disaster agency said on Sunday that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck on Friday, causing waves as high as 6 meters and trapping many people in the rubble of collapsed buildings, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Paulu, which has a population of over 380,000, was littered with ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman
A woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, and police immediately launched a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, where a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on people in the area who have seen or heard something to report.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is just beginning, but I would like to appeal to anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
“I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, whose on-board cameras may have recorded something, to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the dead woman lived in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends arrived at the crime scene who think they know the woman to ask where she was found this morning.
Police said they are investigating and are now informing the relatives of the victims.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, had just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was unable to speak.
Residents have now learned that it will take several hours before they can return home.
One man was told by a police officer that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
He keeps saying, "That's terrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were behind the tape and another was waiting outside.
In the closed area there are a number of police officers who monitor the house.
Anyone with any information can send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 with the code 247 of September 30.
A statue of Cromwell in parliament has become a hit recently due to a dispute over “rewriting history”
His expulsion would be a well-deserved punishment for his fanatical, Taliban-style Puritan followers destroying many of England’s cultural and religious artefacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "foolishness" and "an effort to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell would be one of the targets in front of the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell neither ordered nor carried out iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.”
The magnificent portrayal of Cromwell, authored by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testament to 19th-century opinion and part of the character’s historiography, which many think still deserves to be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people regard Cromwell, albeit a little less today than at the end of the 19th century, as a defender of parliament from outside pressure, in his case of course from the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of incessant historical debate.
It is certain that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-identified figure who represents one side of this divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer Pig Teased by Chinese Farmer
According to local media reports, a pig farmer was attacked and killed in a market in southeastern China.
As the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday, a man with only the surname “Yuan” was found dead with a severed artery in a puddle of blood near a pigsty at a market in Liu-pchan-shui, Kuizhou province.
A pig farmer is preparing to administer the vaccine to pigs in a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly arrived with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door to the next shed open.
According to him, there was a large pig with a mouth of blood in the pigsty.
According to information, during forensic examination, it was confirmed that the 250-kilogram pig tore the farmer.
“The cousin had his legs all bloody and torn,” Guiyang Evening News quoted his cousin, whom he calls Wu.
Security camera footage shows Yuan coming to the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up so as not to attack anyone else while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Market officials are reportedly negotiating with Yuan's family for compensation for his death.
Attacks on humans by pigs are rare, but they have occurred in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts and critically injured the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300kg pig had pushed a Welsh farmer to a tractor and driven him away by the farmer’s wife.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
"They're just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show them a lot of respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to the south-west of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to be weakening and moving over the cooler waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
In the coming days, however, it will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and the southwest of the US.
At 5 a.m. eastern time, Rosa reached a wind speed of 137 km/h, representing a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 km southeast of the city of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure furrow forms over the Pacific Ocean and moves east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, it will take the form of a tropical storm and begin to push tropical humidity northward into the southwestern United States.
In some parts of Mexico, Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of precipitation on Monday.
Tropical humidity then, with a low-pressure furrow approaching in the coming days, will cause heavy rain in the southwest of the US.
Precipitation of 25 to 100 mm locally will cause dangerous torrential floods, mudslides and possible landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation to approach 50 to 75 mm per hour in places, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwest of the U.S., especially over most of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
In rapidly deteriorating conditions, torrential flooding may occur due to the dispersed nature of tropical rain.
Given the danger of tropical rains, it would be very unwise to walk into the desert.
Heavy rains can cause canyons to become raging rivers, and thunderstorms can bring local gusts of wind and dust.
The approaching low-pressure furrow will bring strong local precipitation on some parts of the southern California coast.
Total precipitation above 13 mm may occur, which could cause smaller debris streams and slippery roads.
It will be the first rainfall in the region.
On Sunday evenings and Monday mornings, rare tropical showers begin to approach Arizona, and on Monday evenings and Tuesdays, the rain spreads.
On Tuesday, heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners and continue until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense temperature changes throughout the US, as the Arctic begins to cool, but in the tropical zone it will still be quite warm.
This sometimes leads to rapid temperature changes over short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is the center of the USA on Sunday.
The difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa is almost 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, they will again try to spread the lingering summer heat.
In most areas in the central and eastern United States, a warm start to October is expected, with temperatures around 27°C from the southern plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
In New York City, it could be 27°C on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows a high probability of above-average temperatures in the east of the US in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's interview was watched by more than 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched on six television channels Thursday the gripping testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming with news of a sudden Friday reversal: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Christine Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure Kavanaugh was groping her drunk at a high school party and trying to undress her.
Kavanaugh, in his excited testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
It is likely that the event was watched by more than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen.
The company counted average ratings on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers for other stations that broadcast the statements, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look at the office.
For comparison, it is a similar number of spectators who watch football matches in the play-offs or the awarding of Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, had the highest viewership of any channel, with an average of 5.69 million viewers watching it during the day-long hearing, according to Nielsen.
The second was ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reports that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
Interest continued even after the meeting.
The main character of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught him yelling at protesters on Friday morning as he was about to take the elevator to a hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
CNN broadcast live as he stood with his eyes down for a few minutes and let himself be blasphemous.
One woman said, "I'm standing right in front of you."
"Do you think the country is telling the truth?"
He also heard, “You have power, but many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he added that he would say more at the committee meeting.
All cable and television networks would later broadcast live when the Judiciary Committee was due to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate's vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the charges against the candidate were investigated by the FBI by next week, a demand by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by his conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's vote was important because it was clear that without the investigation, Republicans would not have had enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘politicians’ over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of being "politicians" about Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, which was close to that with the prime minister on the front page, her former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called Chequers plan, saying that the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other’s duties was “completely absurd”.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dytheon Simpson, who is suspected of killing LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU player.
The Baton Rouge police department said Dyteon Simson, 20, was arrested and jailed on second-degree murder charges.
Authorities released a video of a confrontation between the Sims and the Simpsons, and police say the Sims lost his glasses during the match.
According to the WABF channel, which belongs to CBS, the police secured the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
According to police, Simpson admitted to shooting Wayde after questioning him.
According to the lawyer, the bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner’s office in East Baton Rouge released a preliminary report saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police, and local citizens for helping with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked local police officers for their "drunkenness and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-meter forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for the LSU,
Last season he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that Wayde’s death had “shocked” the team and “shocked” him.
"That's what you're still afraid of," Wade said.
Volcano spews ash at Mexico City
The ash from Popacatépetl volcano has hit the southern part of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after volcanic activity increased and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The center watched a series of roars and tremors.
Images of car windshields covered in a thin layer of ash have appeared on social media in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 72 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of the capital. The last earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017 and had a force of 7.1 degrees.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
On the anniversary of the independence vote, police clashed with Catalan separatists
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands took part in competitive demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the independence vote that divided Catalonia.
The riot police blocked a group of masked separatists who threw eggs and powder paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually flooded with tourists.
Later, clashes broke out, and the police had to use batons to calm them down.
The pro-independence groups chanted "We will not forget, we will not forgive" for several hours in the face of protesting supporters of the union who shouted "Long live Spain".
According to the local press, 14 people were slightly injured during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal but is celebrated by separatist Catalans, tensions remain high in the independence-seeking region.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, but turnout was low because opponents of the breakaway boycotted them.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to end voting in polling stations in violent clashes across the region.
Pro-independence groups stayed out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but she had to choose a different route.
The 86-year-old electrician, Narcis Termes, who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped for independence for Catalonia.
“Last year we had some of our best moments.
My parents were crying for joy that they could vote, but now we are in a dead end,” he said.
Despite an important, albeit narrow, victory in regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have had to fight to keep things running this year. Many of their best-known leaders have either gone into exile themselves or are awaiting trial for their part in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Forty-two-year-old fitter Joan Puig recorded a protest in support of the police on his phone and says the conflict has been fanned by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more tense,” he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been awaiting trial in prison since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“Candidacy in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the repression we are witnessing from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crash at home
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after repeatedly crashing into a house in Londonderry.
The event took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 19:30 local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gate and the house itself.
At some point, someone may have shot the car from the crossbow.
Meng's goal secured Livingston a 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
Livingston, who was promoted from the lower division, shocked the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard only the second defeat of 18 games in the role of the manager of the club from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga’s trophy proved decisive when Gary Holt’s team reached Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard’s team has not yet won the Premier League this season, and next Sunday will be the first Hearts to lose eight points.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston has expanded the unbeaten streak in the division to six games, so head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has yet to experience a defeat.
Livingston did not take advantage of the opportunity against the disembodied guests
Holt's team should have led long before the goal, because his straightforwardness caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but failed in front of the gate, then Alan Lithgow just narrowly missed the head of Craig Halkett in front of the goal.
The hosts just had to watch the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could annoy the guests with standard situations.
Then came the key goal.
A free kick was ordered against the Rangers, and Livingston created a loophole, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly sending Menga to score the ball in the center of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but home defense was impenetrable for them, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was usually not much of a workhorse.
The same image of the game was in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman was stopped by Ranger Allan McGregor's legs and Lithgow missed another standard Livingston situation.
Centers were constantly flying into the penalty area of Livingston, which the players were constantly cleaning, and two penalty kicks came in vain - after Halkett's attack on deputy Glenn Middleton and another by the hand.
The "Phenomenon" of Livingston - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were, without exception, excellent and on their way up they continue to exceed expectations.
Their style of play and the team have hardly changed since returning to the top, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for how much the team has stirred up since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was formidable, leading a superbly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on alert at all times.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but they don't live up to those standards anymore.
Their ending was poor – they only made it to the home side once – and for the Rangers it should be a wake-up call because they were in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received a mixed reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29th), the sky was blue and everyone was smiling.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed over a number of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
It has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of 25,000 from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but there were many supporters in the area who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people were also heard – many of them Kurds – protesting against Erdogan, who condemned his policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The opposing protests reflect the controversy of a visitor who was hailed as a hero by some German Turks and cursed by others as an autocrat.
Deptford accident: cyclist dies after collision with car
In London, a cyclist died after a collision with a car.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 a.m. local time near Bestwood Street junction with the busy Evelyn Street in Deptford, south-east of the city.
The driver stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man was dead on the spot.
The death came just months after another cyclist died about a kilometre and a half from the scene of Saturday’s tragedy in an accident on Childers Street when the driver drove away.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were now trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The road is closed, buses run on alternate routes, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in riots
According to the prison office, six guards were injured in riots in the high-security men's prison.
The riots broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 a.m. local time and continue.
Specialized guards from the Tornado team were called in to deal with the riots involving eight prisoners in one wing.
The guards suffered minor injuries and were treated on the spot.
A prison service spokesman said: “In order to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison, specially trained prison staff have been deployed.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend a longer time behind bars.”
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous delinquents in the country.
In June, it was announced that the director of the prison had ended up in the hospital after the prisoner’s attack.
And last October, riot police were called to the prison because of serious riots in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (an area where droughts can benefit)
It’s not usual for Arizona to be hit by a low-pressure tropical furrow, but that’s likely to happen early next week as the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa overwhelms the desert southwest and brings the risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona for southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday and bring rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that “Since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained their tropical storm or pressure below within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict precipitation of 50 to 100 mm, in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona, up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the desert northwest, including the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to fall 25 to 50 mm, with local totals of up to 100 mm.
For those who are not at risk of torrential flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing, because the area has been hit by drought.
Floods are a very serious thing, but these precipitations may help somewhere, because the southwest of the United States has just been hit by a drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least an “extreme drought,” the second-highest category.
The path of Hurricane Rosa will first lead to the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still hurricane-force with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, will then be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico on Sunday morning, moving 19 km/h to the north.
Then the storm will meet the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, and therefore lose its strength.
It is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, rainfall will be heavy, posing a high risk of flooding.
"A total of 75 to 150 mm of precipitation is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with up to 250 mm of precipitation likely," the weather.com news server said.
Rosa then travels like a tropical storm through Mexico to the north, arriving at the Arizona border on Tuesday morning, passing through Arizona, and entering southern Utah late Tuesday night.
“The main risk to Rosa or her debris is expected to be very severe collisions in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the desert southwest of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause deadly torrential flooding and mudflows in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was stabbed in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 a.m. local time.
He was taken to hospital and his condition is now “stable”.
According to Avon and Somerset police, young men between the ages of 17 and 20 were detained overnight in the Radstock area.
Police are looking for witnesses who may have a recording of what happened on their mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh ‘tempted the wickedness and anger’ of Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the Democratic Party’s reckless and scandalous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “experienced the wickedness and anger” of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he emphatically and emphatically denied allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that on that day, "Americans witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliance and quality and courage."
He told a crowd of West Virginia supporters that “the voice of the confirming Judge Kavanaugh is the confirmation of one of the finest legal minds of our time, a lawyer who has an outstanding public service record.”
The president was indirectly referring to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republicans taking part in midterm elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not running, but I’m still on the move,” he said.
"That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
Trump said Democrats had opted for “resistance and obstruction.”
An adviser to the Republican leadership told CNN that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's Senate nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia killed hundreds of people and the number of victims is still growing
Authorities said on Saturday that after Indonesia’s Sulawesi island was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami, at least 384 people lost their lives, many of them swept away by huge waves that flooded beaches.
On the beach in Palu, hundreds of people gathered for the festival on Friday, but at dusk, the coast was hit by up to six-meter waves, which killed many people and destroyed everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still continuing their activities on the beaches and did not immediately run away, so they fell victim to the waves,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency, told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami wave did not go by itself, it took cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that before the impact on the coast, the tsunami wave on the open sea was spreading at a speed of 800 km/h.
He said that some people escaped from the wave into the trees and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the Disaster Mitigation Agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The consequences shook the coastal city on Saturday as well.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s strong tremors was about 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, which could have magnified the tsunami wave.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He mentioned that the bodies of some of the victims were found wedged under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater on the coast 300km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is near the epicenter of the quake.
According to him, the communication was “completely paralyzed without any information” from Donggala.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live in the area, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse," the statement said.
The agency was heavily criticised on Saturday for failing to report that Palu was hit by a tsunami, even though authorities said the waves came at the time of the warning.
In amateur footage shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of the building is heard desperately warning people on the street of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, the coast is hit by a water wall that sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the report immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities say the military has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport in the city has been reopened for aid transport only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Saturday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision workers from Donggala arrived in the city of Paulu, where employees were hiding in shelters made of cetaceans built in the courtyard of an office building, they saw images of destruction along the way, Mr. Doseba says.
"They said they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he adds.
It's too bad.
When relief groups began the sad work of disaster relief, some of them complained that foreign workers with great experience were not allowed to come to Paul.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to flow to the place of calamity when a national disaster zone is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Indonesian Red Cross spokesman Aulia Arriani.
“Once the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can start international aid, but that’s not yet the case.”
When the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami hit Paul, friends and relatives of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that lighten the grim stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the canal.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped for two days under the rubble next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders at the Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
Other people detained at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As someone who has been involved in paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden,” he says.
Mr. Gendon described how, in the hours following the paragliding community learned of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to contestants from Palu who were attending the beach festival.
His messages, however, instead of two blue ticks, ended with a gray mark.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered," he says.
Thieves took $26,750 during a refill at an ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a Newport Police Department press release, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee Friday morning while refilling an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the driver of the car was emptying an ATM in the entertainment complex and preparing to put more money into it.
As he did so, another man “runs out from behind a Brink employee” and steals a bag of money to be put into an ATM.
Witnesses said they saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incidents.
If you have any information about the identity of the suspects, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, writing, "A being formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the pseudonym as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is due to release his new album Yandhi.
In the show, he will replace singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "feelings reasons," according to the show's creator.
West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning for him, in addition to shortening his current professional name.
“In my opinion, ‘ye’ is the most used word in the Bible to mean ‘you,’” West said earlier this year as he spoke to radio host Big Boy about his album.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
It changed from Kanya, which means the one, to just Ye – as a mere reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
Many other famous rappers have also changed their name.
Sean Combs was known at various times as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former co-worker Jay-Z also wrote his name alternately with and without the hyphen, in both upper and lowercase letters.
Mexico's AMLO president vows not to use military against civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students, newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
At a time when leftist student movements were spreading throughout Latin America, soldiers began shooting at people in a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those who study, and by opening other free public universities.
He said unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities are dragging young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. to Double Funding for Artificial Intelligence
According to investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), and the US should double the amount it spends on research in this area.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government released announcements about AI, even though the U.S. as a whole has no formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China last year introduced a plan under which it wants to be the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start given that all other countries are much further ahead than the US and we are looking for another breakthrough in AI,” Lee says.
Lee told CNBC this week that doubling funding could double the chance that the next big AI discovery will be made in the US.
Lee, who published his book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that outperformed the best American player in Othello, and later was a senior research fellow at Microsoft and president of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee praised previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotic Challenge, and asked when the next one would be to help identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government grants, according to Lee.
“The top academics are not being led by China, but by corporations,” Lee says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring top university experts to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States improve its AI efforts.
“In my opinion, AI PhD holders should be automatically offered green cards,” he says.
The State Council of China issued a New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way that the National Science Council and other government organizations give money to researchers in the U.S., but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee says.
The U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence this year to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of the Artificial Intelligence Select Committee.
And DARPA announced this month that it is investing $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF Foundation, it is now investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
However, the U.S. legislature, which wanted to create a National Security Commission for artificial intelligence, has not done anything for many months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether they want to change the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory, and therefore vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will weaken the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a campaign calling for a boycott has raised doubts about whether at least 50 percent of voters will show up for the referendum to be valid.
The question in the referendum was: “Are you in favor of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia, to join organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” says Olivera Georgievska, 79, from Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough members of parliament have said they will abide by the result of the vote.
Changing the name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no problems had been reported by 1 p.m.
Voter turnout, however, was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters ultimately cast their ballots.
“I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” says Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in a Macedonian referendum on a name change that would open the country up to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small podium and pulls out chairs in front of tents erected by people boycotting the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our head held high, not with a door for the servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our pride.
If they don’t want us like Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%, much-needed investment.
“I think the big majority will be in favor, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
The result, he said, would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll published last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters could take part in the referendum – less than the required turnout.
In another survey conducted by Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV, it was found that 57 percent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, it must be 50 percent plus one voter.
The referendum’s failure would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since its accession last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City came to the goal through the entire defense of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defended Brighton on Saturday, securing a 2-0 win for Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In the 65th minute, Aguero's goal seemed ridiculously easy.
It all started with a pass that the Argentine striker received in the center of the field.
He sprinted between the three Brighton defenders and made his way into the open.
Aguero was surrounded by four green jerseys.
At the edge of Brighton's penalty area, one defender was outflanked and several others overtook.
The next pass on the left, he found Sterling.
The English striker tapped the ball in the penalty area back to Aguer, who shot Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan into the right side of the net with a right-handed shot.
"Aguero has problems with his legs," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We thought he was going to play 55 or 60 minutes.
And so it was.
We were lucky to score a goal at the time.”
The initial advantage for the Sky Blues in this Premier League match, however, was arranged by Sterling.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep into Brighton territory.
On the left, he sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane processed the ball and then sent Sterling to a distant pole.
The Sky Blues striker tucked the ball into the net just before slipping off the pitch.
City will play on Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil the joy of the Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there was not much reason to re-enter.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to pitch against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday—but only if the Rockies, who lead NL West for one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers, have a chance of a playoff.
The Rockies secured at least a wild card on Friday night with a 5-2 win over the Nationals, but they still want to win their first division title.
“Even if we’re not playing for anything, we can at least throw it away, because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the second team will play with probably the greatest effort I’ll experience this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to play it?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to pitch Scherzer in such a situation.
For Scherzer, it would be his 34th start, training on Thursday and pitching on Sunday, which is his usual day off.
Washington's right-handed pitcher has 18-7 statistics this season with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 shifts.
Trump speaks at a rally in West Virginia
The president has indirectly commented on the situation surrounding his candidate for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republicans taking part in mid-term elections.
“In November, everything we have achieved will be at stake.
There are five weeks left until one of the most important choices of our lives.
It’s one of the big, big ones – I’m not running, but we’re always on the move and I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
“You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see this happening right now.
And they are determined to take power by any means necessary, you see the wickedness, the disgust.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to fight to gain power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
He said the Democrats had opted for "resistance and obstruction."
"And you've seen it in the last four days," he added, saying the Democrats are "angry and evil and disgusting and lying."
He mentioned, on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to a loud roar of the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document out?
Uh, what?
No, no, wait—that was really bad body language—worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse think tank.
He is intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When the activists from Momenta in my local party voted for my admonition, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour Members to be told that they are not welcome - because they have given their honest opinion.
My fellow Member of Parliament Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she resolutely stood up to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I have been criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, paradoxically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of Friday’s Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East said that “we want the meetings to be accessible and productive.”
For most of the eight years I was a local Labour MP, the GC meetings on Friday night were just that.
Unfortunately, most meetings do not take place these days, and the promise of a “kinder, gentler” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differing views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is being assessed as to whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
Colleagues who I had previously thought had similar political views suddenly expected me to turn 180° and take positions that I otherwise would not agree with – be it national security or the EU’s single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – a tirade of social media abuse ensues, calling for my appeal, condemning the politics of the centre and telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I’m luckier than some of my colleagues, because comments directed at me are usually political.
I respect the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who every day face a surge of sexist or racist insults, but never give up.
One aspect of this era of politics that I am most disappointed with is how insults become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer the diverse stream of opinion, and with every suggestion of mistrust or change in the rules of selection, the party becomes more limited.
Over the last two years, I have been advised many times to hold back, not to talk so much and then “I’ll be fine”.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party as a school pupil 32 years ago, provoked by the negligence of Margaret Thatcher’s government, which let my general school class literally fall apart, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need them most – whether as a local councilor or as a cabinet minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be surprised by my political positions and areas where I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who backed the proposal on Friday, I would only say that as the country pushes for a Brexit that will hurt homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But my main message is not to the Moment in Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of appeal or political pragmatism will deter me from acting in what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr climbs to the top
The two late fives somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this amazingly fun match Tennent's Premiership.
Now they are at the head of the table, as the only undefeated.
In the end, it was an excellent defense and better use of chances, which helped the home team to win, and the coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
"We've been through a lot in our games and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says, “Honor to Ayr, they took a better chance than we did.”
Grant Anderson's five in the 14th minute, changed by Frazier Clim, sent Ayr forward, but a yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, who was released by the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical superiority and Jason Baggot got the unchanged five.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty kick and then scored at half-time, changing the solo attempt to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's five, changed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
This was followed by a longer delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who left the pitch on a stretcher, and when the game started again, Ayr jumped again thanks to Stafford McDowall's five, which was transformed by Climo.
Ayru's replacement, Blair Macpherson, was then given a yellow card and Melrose again used the player's extra thanks to Bruce Colvin's unaltered five after a brief heavy press.
However, the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow for attacking Clima without the ball, MacPherson placed the ball behind the advancing Maul Ayru from the penalty shootout.
Climo turned, again almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe grabbed David Armstrong's kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth home team.
Star Still Game launches a new career in the hospitality industry
It seems that the star of the Still Game series Ford Kieran is moving into the hospitality industry. It turned out that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC's popular television series, which he writes and co-stars with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final series of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the extract from the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the report, but a source in the Scottish Sun newspaper suggested that Kiernan wanted to engage in a “prosperous restaurant business” in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": inland Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol in front of the naval headquarters in La Paz, which is decorated with ropes.
Above the public buildings, a blue flag flies in the color of the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca for the Amazon are described by the motto: “The sea is our right.
Getting it is our duty.”
Throughout inland Bolivia, there is still a vivid memory of the coastline that the country lost in favor of Chile in the bloody war for resources in the 19th century – as well as the desire to resurrect the Pacific Ocean.
These aspirations are perhaps the biggest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court of justice, which is due to expire on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and calm, and of course expects a positive result," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will be watching the MSD’s decisions on big screens across the country in the hope that a tribunal in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim that – after many decades of intermittent talks – Chile is obliged to negotiate giving Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, Evo Morales — who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year — also has a keen interest in Monday’s decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it is unlikely that a court would rule in Bolivia’s favor — and even if it did, not much would change.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to assign territory to anyone in Chile and said it would not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the MSD’s decision comes just six months after the last arguments were made shows that the case “wasn’t complicated,” according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years have not only failed to support the Bolivian cause, they may have slowed it down.
"The issues of access to the sea have been taken over by the current Bolivian government," Zarate says.
He adds that Morales’ offensive rhetoric has weakened all remaining goodwill in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will one day begin to act again, but after that it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance "to end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – would use the question of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he said.
“Judgment is an opportunity to discover that we need to deal with the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless the United States can be trusted.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never arm its nuclear weapons first if it can’t trust Washington
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on promises made at a summit of the leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comments come after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared set to restart stalled nuclear diplomacy for more than three months for a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a “planet of hope” that the ongoing sanctions and U.S. objections to a declaration ending the Korean War could sometimes bring the North to its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes significant steps toward disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
There is widespread skepticism, however, that Pyongyang is serious about giving up this arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo wants to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris shows show that the latest trend of huge headgear will soon arrive in your fashion stores
If you want to expand your collection of hats or completely block out the sun, your search is over.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of freaky giant headgear for their Spring/Summer 2019 collection at a show that captivated everyone at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their exciting creations to the piers.
Valentino's showpiece was an exaggerated beige hat with a wide feather-like edge that flooded the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories were decorated melons, a witch hat, and even pineapple – but they weren’t meant to warm the head.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have sewn lips and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One piece resembled diving equipment with a snorkel and goggles, while the other looked like a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion – you’re in luck.
Fashion experts predict that huge hats could also arrive in fashion stores.
The oversized hats come after the “La Bomba”, a half-meter wide straw hat that everyone wore from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind this very impractical hat, which flooded social media, sent another huge creation to the show piers – a straw beach bag that is almost as big as the swimsuit model who wears it.
A dark orange reef bag lined with reef fringes and equipped with a white leather handle was an exhibition piece of the La Riviera Spring/Summer 2019 collection by Jacquemus at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in fashion stores for next summer – given the designer’s success with them, it would hardly be possible to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are a necessity for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have had a number of academic successes, and this continues in 2018 with other excellent exam results. Individual and group successes in sports, art, music and other community activities only underline this.
These schools have more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and strive to provide the best possible level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement individually tailored school education plans, we observe that modern languages are still a popular and sought-after subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a person in a language they understand, it goes straight to their head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes straight to his heart.”
It is a significant observation that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely only on English.
The latest results of this year's exams show that languages are in the first place of the tables, with independent schools having the highest success rate.
A total of 68 percent of pupils who learned a foreign language achieved the best grade of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of Mandarin students, 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students achieved the highest A grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as the subjects that students choose are equally valued in the curricula of independent and other schools as STEM subjects (science, technology, technical fields and mathematics).
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the reasons employers cite as problems in filling vacancies are insufficient language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming a necessity in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more jobs require languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whichever career you choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have the real advantage of having such a lifelong skill in the future.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person who speaks multiple languages will automatically gain an advantage over the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013 among 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 per cent of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to lead a conversation, with the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of people, namely 15 per cent, being French.
Therefore, it is important for today’s children to invest in language teaching.
If children know more languages, especially the languages of emerging economies, they will be more likely to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, every school differs in what languages it teaches.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach the languages considered most important to the UK in the 2020 outlook, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what the child is interested in, he will always have a choice of several languages at independent schools with teachers who are experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment that prepares and equips children with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds for them.
At the moment, there is no denying that languages are essential for the future of the country in the global business environment, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and prominence to young people in Scotland.
I'll be honest with you.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will play in the Lakers for the first time on Sunday.
Fans who are looking forward to LeBron James playing for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time will soon be waiting.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opening game in San Diego against the Denver Nuggets.
It is not yet clear how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably only play a limited number of minutes.
Last week after practice, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games in the preseason.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career," he said.
Trump's speech in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five meetings scheduled for next week, including stops at friendly venues such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Given the suspension of the vote to confirm his candidate for a vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to win support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans face the risk of losing Congress in November’s election.
What time does Trump’s speech start tonight, and how can you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s meeting in West Virginia online below via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about the hearing of the candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, which took place this week and was very tense due to allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior. The Senate confirmation vote is expected to be postponed for a week before the FBI investigation takes place.
But the main goal of this wave of meetings is to help Republicans pick up the pace ahead of the November election.
According to Reuters, Trump’s campaign organizers say the five rallies next week are aimed at “giving energy to volunteers and supporters so that Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control of the Senate is so important to his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible in this busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News radio station, supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania” could come to the Wesbanco Arena rally in Wheeling today and be watched by the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, it will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, where he scored more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senator Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s not a good sign that the president has to come to help him with the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows guts to fight to keep hope ahead of Sunday singles
After three one-sided matches, Saturday’s doubles could be just what Ryder Cup needed.
The rocking pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but the players really trust it, and most of all in such competitions.
So where does the pendulum swing now?
"They were six points ahead and now it's four, so we're looking at the pendulum moving a little bit towards us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, it leads by four points and there are still twelve.
As Spieth says, Americans feel they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that can encourage them, such as the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each can boast three points out of four.
Spieth was lethal in the transition from tee to green, and he sets an example.
The celebratory screams intensified in the continuation of his round, when he managed a key heel to win the whole match, when he and Tomas were two holes behind.
His putt, which won them a 15-hole match, met a similar roar that tells you that the American team is not out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own game," Spieth said.
That’s all any of these players have left.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, unquestionably the main story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple from Europe are four out of four and can’t do anything wrong.
Moliwood was the only pair who missed the hole on Saturday afternoon, but missed Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning again.
The course and the way the energy flows both towards and from the stormy audience confirms that these are the players destined for Sunday’s victory, and that by sunset over Le Golf National there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time on a different hole.
However, the talk of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly collaborated with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning four-ball game, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A hole and two doubles on the front nine buried the Spaniard and the Swede in an abyss from which they had not climbed.
No one will help you on Sunday.
The games of two pairs on two balls are so fascinating when you closely observe the interactions of people in a pair, the advice they give each other, the advice they don’t give each other, and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and took a significant lead until the last day, but this game of two pairs also showed that the US team has a stomach for a fight that some, especially from the states, doubted.
By the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe leads with a score of 10-6 points
Europe will gain a healthy advantage until the last day of the Ryder Cup, then from Saturday's doubles games on two balls came out with a lead of 10-6 over the United States.
Inspired by the duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who reportedly won almost twice over the struggling Tiger Woods, they decided to make four notches at Le Golf National.
The European side with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to keep the trophy they lost in Hazeltine, dominated the morning two-ball games with the American side, which failed in the 3-1 series.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four, won two games, but could not get into a deficit.
Jim Fury's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12 games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating players Woods and Patrick Reed in the game on two balls and then smoothly defeated tired Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau even more strongly 5&4.
Woods, who played two matches on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in a doubles game on two balls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested after a two-ball morning, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in a 2&1 loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the No. 1 and No. 3 in the world rankings.
But Europe did not have it on this pleasant fresh day southwest of Paris, won all over the line.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored two points for the United States on Saturday.
They won a rough 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a two-ball game and returned later to beat the pair Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in a doubles game, despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has the team returned from a four-point deficit to the singles, although as the defending Fury's side only needs a draw to win the trophy.
After the second day was the best for two days, it seems that the Sunday counterattack is behind them.
North Korea says it will not “under any circumstances” arm itself unilaterally and without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday that continued UN sanctions had deepened its distrust of the United States and under such circumstances the country would never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual general assembly that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the site of nuclear tests and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we do not see a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and it is not possible to disarm unilaterally under such circumstances.”
While Ri echoed well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a “gradual” approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea would be rewarded for each step it took, his statement seemed significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization just because Pyongyang had gone through it in the past.
Ri mentioned a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work for the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump pledged security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 war, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases pressure on sanctions to enforce its targets, and even objects to ‘declaring an end to the war,’” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea and not the US were on the side of this issue of denuclearization, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a stalemate.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the U.N. General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s missiles on U.S. soil was inevitable after “Mr. Bad President” Trump labeled Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened the “total destruction” of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much work remains to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is fully denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, saying, “If it takes two years, three years, or five months — it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for taking action.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and relentlessly until we realize complete, final, verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo and Ri met at the U.N. General Assembly, and Pompeo said he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times so far this year, but his latest trip did not end well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, only to be declared by North Korea within hours to make “gangster demands.”
North Korea has pledged to meet Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and also the nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the “appropriate measures” he hoped for were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students participate in a course designed to teach them enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has prompted all of its students to sleep more, in an effort to combat the growing culture of macho study all night long when students are awake and encouraged with caffeine.
Academics have found that students at the world’s most renowned university are often clueless when it comes to the basics of self-care.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women’s Hospital, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you only telling me this now, in my senior year?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep — which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students were seriously sleep-deprived during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is an image of student dorms where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleep habits.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
However, we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes," Professor Czeisler added.
A culture of pride in “all-night studying” still exists, he added, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of lack of sleep is also growing.
Getting enough good quality sleep should be a student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said — even to keep from gaining weight, because sleep deprivation switches the brain into starvation mode so that the person is still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design a course that one of his classes took last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push the whole course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar degree program before entering a competitive institution.
The professor recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that can disrupt your circadian rhythm, leading to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal sunk Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss when Dolly Mengy's goal established Steven Gerrard's dissatisfaction with a 1–0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox party tried to record their first victory from February 4 to February 1 at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused only Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his post eight points from leading Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts leaders.
Menga hit seven minutes before the half-time and the Rangers seemed uninspired and determined to catch up.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and just behind the Hibernian team by a one-goal margin.
And there could be more trouble for the Rangers after line umpire Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after apparently being hit by an object from the auditorium.
Gerrard made eight changes on his side, moving past Ayr to the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11 that scored a Hearts point last week and would be happy to see his well-trained team strangle their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have mastered possession, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were supposed to score just two minutes after the start, when Menga first let Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder buried his big chance.
Keaghan Jacobs' long free kick then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only bite at the back post.
The Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have a quarter-hour penalty when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson swept the Colombian challenge off the table.
The Rangers only managed two shots on target in the first half, but former goaltender Ibrox Liam Kelly was surprised by Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot.
While Livi's opener could have been against the game after 34 minutes, no one can deny that they deserved it for the hard work.
The Rangers again failed to deal with Jacobs' deep set.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and picked up Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard took action during the break and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the exchange had an almost immediate result when the wing sank into Morelos, but the formidable Kelly fought his way out of the line and blocked the attack.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into the game exactly the kind they like when Lithgow and Halkett throw one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have deepened its lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood well to block Jacobs before Litgow ran from the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton had another delayed claim to punishment when he messed with Jacobs, but Thomson turned away again.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our almanac "Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years old, and still growing... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
Geiger Counter then also became a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring the seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What on earth is that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter that’s used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can really hear the effects of the atoms spewed by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: “Oh, yeah, he’s really cracking up right now!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine could teach immune system to ‘see’ dangerous cells
New cancer vaccine could teach immune system to ‘see’ dangerous cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation in the laboratory
Then they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancers, and then the rivets are injected again
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
One woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells has had ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, transforming them in a laboratory so they can “see” a protein common in many cancers called HER2 and then being re-applied to the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have developed a very promising vaccine.
HER2 “controls the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach, in which immune cells were taken from patients and "taught" to target cancer cells, was already being promoted in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West attended a pro-Trump sermon in his mage hat after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go very well
Kanye West was fired at Saturday Night Live after a confusing performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After singing a third song that night called Ghost Town, in which he was wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he spat at the Democrats and repeated his support for President Trump.
“I often talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you love Trump, he’s a racist?’
“If I hated racism, I wouldn’t have been in America long ago,” he said.
SNL launched a parody show starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before a Senate Judiciary Committee on the rape allegations against Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, footage of West's theatrical speech was recorded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West.
West also complained to the audience that his head ornaments had been well eaten behind the scenes.
“I was bullied behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go in there with that hat."
It's bullying!
They also said I was in the wrong place,” the Washington Examiner said.
West continued, "Do you want to see the wrong place?" and added that he would "put on his Superman suit, because that means you can't say what to do."
Try love."
His comments earned only the roar of the audience at least twice, and the SNL members looked embarrassed, embarrassed, Variety says, and one person even said, “The whole studio is completely silent.”
West was invited as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West baffled many by singing the song I Love disguised as a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous characters: THANK YOU FOR MAKING DAVIA."
But guest talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "was just who he is, and that's absolutely amazing."
“But I DO NOT want to reward someone (by buying their music or clothing or promoting their ‘art’) who I believe represents and transmits to the world an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's single.
Just like us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, used to be called Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accusations of attempted murder in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was killed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is due to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game Thrones star Kit Harington has embarked on a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in hand in the violent medieval fantasy series HBO.
However, the actor, 31, stepped out of the macho hero stereotype and said that such on-screen roles mean that young boys often feel they have to be tough to earn respect.
He told The Sunday Times Culture Kit that he believes “something is wrong” and asked how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Star of Thrones star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he has “quite a strong” voice on the issue.
"At the moment, I personally feel, quite strongly - what's wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach teenage men about the problem we're seeing here?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity thanks to its highly masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What do boys learn on TV, on the streets, in them the feeling that it is necessary for every man to have such a side?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time – how do we change that?
Because I'm sure the young man has changed for the worse.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not play in any of the Game of Thrones prequels or sequels after the series was completed because he had had enough of "fights and horses".
From November, Kit will play Sam Shepard in the restored Right West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his current wife Rose was the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the set of the show, so he gave me my future family and my entire life,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love object of Kit's character Jon Snow, in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie’s family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official figures, the virus affects more than 820,000 people in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, approximately 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, which meant a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 a year.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly still widespread.
Given the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from a lack of sexual protection during these contacts.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff leaked GOP senators' data, using the terms "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory"
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced claims that a member of her staff sent the personal data of three Republican U.S. senators to the lawmakers' wiki pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the allegations were backed by “ultra-right” scientists and websites.
"Lies, lies and other despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday on the Internet and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during Senate hearings on allegations of sexual abuse by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address, which is the source of the contributions, is linked to Waters’ office and have published information about Waters’ staff members, Hill says.
"This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“A member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations – was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly earned online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"That suggests he doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress."
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
He can't be defiant.
He must not question the prosecutor's motives.
He needs to be calm and not upset.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’s reaction to the Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who they criticized for appearing to be too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who ran against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“If it were true, it would be something,” he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said her office had alerted “competent authorities and law enforcement agencies to these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they are legally responsible for all their actions, which are devastating and dangerous to everyone and all members of my staff."
Johnny English hits the review again – weaker spy parody Rowan Atkinson
It is already common to look for Brexit in every new film with a British tendency, which seems to be the case with this resurgence of Johnny English in a series of action parodies – which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this brazen satire on how obviously bad a nation we are, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this twisted, incompetent, rubber-faced Johnny English had his license to mess things up again in a whole new way – that name more than anything else, signaling that it was a wide comic creation designed for a non-English-speaking cinematic audience.
He is, of course, the dull secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour, has a bit of Inspector Clouseau, a pinch of Mr Bean, and a big chunk of the guy who sang a single note in the Chariots of Fire tune at the London 2012 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony.
The character is also originally based on the traveler and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the already forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, who left chaos behind.
In this latest edition there are one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades briefly tinkered with his helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy is on display, but the humor feels quite undersized and strangely redundant, especially when “serious” movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as a sure ingredient of their production.
Humor is more for children than for adults, and I find Johnny English’s crazy bumps as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent movie gags in Mr Bean’s person.
The long-standing assumption is that the UK has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, to the dismay of an agent on duty – too small a role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last straw for the Prime Minister, who is a pompous and committed character who is already suffering from a complete breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson plays Theresa May as best she can, but there’s nothing much in the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that as soon as every active spy she has is threatened, she will have to return someone from retirement to work.
This means that Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a director in some luxury establishment, but at the same time gives record lessons on how to be a secret agent: here are a few nice gags, because English offers a spy academy similar to the School of Rock.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and met with his long-suffering former partner Bough, who was again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man who lives with a submarine commander, an affective character that Vicki Pepperdine may be a little squandered on.
So Batman and Robin, in their quest for Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action and meet the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s cybercrimes: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey full of farcical mischief: masquerading as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; creating chaos as they sneak aboard Volt’s luxury yacht; and English launches pure anarchy as they attempt to explore the interior of Volt’s house using virtual reality.
All aces are definitely ready for this last sequence, but no matter how kind and stormy it is, it has something from children's television in it.
Quite a moderate thing.
And as with Johnny English’s other films, I couldn’t help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Labour denies developing a plan for Englishmen to work four days a week and get paid in five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is due to consider a radical plan in which Britons will work four days a week and get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the company’s bosses to hand over to the workers the savings that will result from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but they would still take the same reward.
Sources say the idea would “fit” into the party’s economic agenda and plan to tilt the country in the workers’ favor.
The transition to a four-day work week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A long-time Labour member told the Sunday Times: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a wish that fits into the party’s position on balancing the economy in favor of the worker and the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is not currently approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not our party’s policy and the party does not take it into account.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a working conference last week to fulfill his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was committed to returning energy from “anonymous CEOs” and “experts” in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not return to their overall stake, as the Labour government could make “precipitations” based on perceived wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and set up ownership funds that would transfer 10% of the equity of private companies to employees who are entitled to pay annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said in the show “60 minutes” whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their opinion
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the last vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about whether the office’s findings could sway any Republican senators into seeking their support.
In an interview on Sunday’s “60 Minutes,” Correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said I went to the hearing, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened, when the charges came out, and he said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, unequivocal.”
However, Graham’s decision is unshakable.
"I've already made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh, and that would be a really explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett denied it," Graham said, referring to Blasey Ford.
"And none of those she named could verify that.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see anything changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the annual Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York City, offering a very impressive array of stars and an equally impressive mission to end world poverty.
The seventh edition of the Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people to Central Park to enjoy not only artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group supporting the end of poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen now 12 years before it reached its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really how to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “clictivism” – people who feel that signing an online petition or sending a tweet will make a difference?
Global Citizen says it has seen more than 19 million “actions” by its supporters since 2011, and is working to achieve a variety of goals.
It says these actions have contributed to world leaders announcing commitments and measures of more than $37 billion to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the Group announced 390 commitments and announcements arising from its operations, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or funded.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, a UK partnership of investors and implementers committed to “helping children grow to their full potential,” pledging to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the region after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice in the form of malnutrition only a footnote in history,” Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on your website asking, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The global citizen replied, “It’s going to be a long and hard road – sometimes we fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year’s New York event, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Could Use Navy for ‘Blockade’ to Prevent Russian Energy Exports – Home Secretary
Washington can resort to the Navy “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy from entering markets including the Middle East, US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government — is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy in the same way as they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States has the ability, with the help of our Navy, to make sure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, blocked to make sure that their energy is not going to the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that in the U.S. refers to itself as the “voice of the energy consumer”.
He compared Washington’s approach to the negotiations with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are practically the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less an investment in or replacement of fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-purpose” player with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement comes as the Trump administration is on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and has replaced Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to back away from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that Trump says has made Berlin a “guarantee” to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US has taken a stand from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s largest industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren vows to “take a close look” at the 2020 presidential bid, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the midterm elections, she would take a “close look” at the presidential candidacy.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, including the top female position,” she said.
"After November 6th, I'll take a closer look at the presidential candidacy."
During the meeting, Warren also mentioned Donald Trump and said she was “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m scared to the core of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his appointment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted that, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
But a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren voters don’t think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of “probable” Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the nomination.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent for the candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make his decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin Mentions PTSD Track Palin at Meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being listed in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he is going through after his return, may be related to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers are coming back with,” she told the audience at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest an “elephant in the room” and said of her son and other war veterans that “they come back a little different, they come back hardened, they come back and they ask if there is any respect for the things that their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the military, is giving to their country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a domestic violence report and holding a gun while drunk, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports call for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal call for new U.S. government measures that deny asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia issued a brief statement Friday in Washington, D.C., to support asylum seekers and challenge the measure, NBC reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which was filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Organization against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said her partner “and his sons and members of a violent gang” had abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Advocates for the Grace-supporting states described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers in the US, as nations facing pervasive gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Chamber that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new measures “ignore decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the brief friend said.
Lawyers also briefly argued that policies that deny immigrants entry harm the U.S. economy and say they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “add the necessary work.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence as early as June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or because of political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems — even all the serious problems — that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu, where the death toll has already doubled, race to find survivors with time
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her feverish baby boy at an evacuation center in the arid city of Palu.
“Every minute, an ambulance brings in more bodies.
“Clean water is rare.”
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking themselves through wet things, and trying to save whatever they find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals that were destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake were paralyzed.
Some of the injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured spine and shoulder, rested at Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors for ongoing severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted the feeling that a violent earthquake had shaken the hotel room on the fifth floor, which shared a room with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save himself.
I think I was dragged into a wall ruin,” Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're all right."
US ambassador accuses China of ‘bullying’ with propaganda ads
A week after the official Chinese daily published a four-page ad in the US daily that focused on the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned the paid China Daily surcharge on the Des Moines register - the state of Iowa's largest sales newspaper - after accusing China of trying to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional election.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing tried to meddle in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials said Reuters was a new phase of Washington’s escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to advertise in support of trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war that manifests itself at the level of mutual imports.
China’s retaliatory sanctions at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that backed Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had injured U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that China is now doubling down on this bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is exploiting America’s valuable tradition of free speech and a free press by placing paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in a newsstand on the street in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese might have on China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media belongs to the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans Leave Voters Before Election Over Kavanaugh Debacle, Analysts Warn
As many top Republicans defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several sexual assault charges, the analyst warned that they will see a response in the midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotions surrounding this case were extremely high, and most Republicans on the record already say they want to continue voting.
These things cannot be reversed,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute effort to investigate the FBI would be enough to reassure voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday — they won’t forget it tomorrow, and they won’t forget it in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, told The Washington Post on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” at a demonstration in the Senate hallway where Republicans in charge of the Judiciary Committee decided to name Kavanaugh despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break records,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say it's already high, that's true."
But it could be higher, especially among hesitant female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who don’t like the president but often don’t go to the polls.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that if Republicans confirmed it, opposition could follow.
“It’s a confusing mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee vote, or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will take the chair, it’s also about how Republicans handled it and how they treated her,” said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided in opinion as to whom to trust in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with somewhat more sympathy for the latter named.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh’s.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims a Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party during his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Launch New Internet, Overtake Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee’s Open Source platform called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of the Inrupt project was “world domination.”
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and in all at the same time.
What’s unique about a personal online data repository is that it’s entirely up to the user to determine who will have access to what kind of information.
Society calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
The purpose of the Inrupt project, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is to bring resources, processes, and relevant skills to help the Solid platform be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some of the employees working on the project collaborated on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can build their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team, with Facebook and Google, are not talking about making a complete change where all of their business models are turned upside down overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
Berners-Lee, in a media post published on Saturday, wrote that the mission of the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic for this next era of the Web,” Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the clergyman who received the Victoria Cross during the First World War
It has been 100 years since the Church of England’s only clergyman was awarded the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann received the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he had received the highest British military award.
On Saturday, his two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone at a ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his great-grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was “geniusally symbolic” that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s triumphant deed.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt Col Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin with very thick fog and heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.
He later made it to the front line, leading the line forward with "the utmost courage" before throwing himself into the firing field and knocking out three separate units.
Lt. Col. Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather’s actions were “something I could never do, but at the same time something that was humiliating.”
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, they laid a wreath after a show led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt it a great honor to be able to participate in the show" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown by the support that many people give."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine, you've been waiting all night to watch the bloated Bellator 206, only to be denied the main event.
The San José bill contained 13 points, including six on the main card, and the live broadcast took place in the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a match, viewers in the UK were stunned when the news turned into a show about Peppa Pig.
Some remained unexcited after waking up early in the morning for a match.
One Twitter fan described the change in airing on the children’s show as “some form of bad joke.”
“According to government regulations, at 6 a.m., such content is not appropriate, and it is therefore necessary to broadcast children’s shows,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, said after being asked about the broadcast.
"Pig Peppa," yes.
Bellator President Scott Coker said they will work on the programme to ensure that viewers in the UK are involved in the future.
"I think when I think about broadcasting, we can probably handle it," Cooker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday, and we can't do it until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, there were a lot of texts going back and forth, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was the government's fault.
I promise you, it won't happen again.
We’ll reduce it to five games instead of six – as we usually do – and we’ve tried our best to keep the promise to the fans and we haven’t succeeded.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley ‘feeling inferior’ due to sexuality
Olympic water-jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to pursue success.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he was in high school that “not everyone is like him.”
On the first disc of Radio 4’s Desert Island Disc, introduced by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that because of the possibility of becoming a parent, he was less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a regular host of the long-running show, was given several months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a survivor in Laverne's first program, said he felt "less valuable" than anyone who grew up with him because "it wasn't socially unacceptable for you to like boys and girls."
He said, "Until now, these feelings of inferiority and otherness were the real things that gave me the strength and power to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was “Someone”, he said, not to disappoint anyone who would eventually find out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a high-profile LGBT rights activist and used his presence at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with the man – American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “found him unprepared.”
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years older last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you experience so much at such a young age — he was at his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died three years later of cancer — he said it wasn’t easy to find someone at the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple adopted Robert Ray Black-Daley's son in June, and Daley said his "whole point of view" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it would have been like, ‘I want to win a gold medal,’” he said.
"You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic medalist is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn’t accept that he was going to die, and the last thing he asked was if they already had tickets to the London Olympics in 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him - you won't be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until the moment he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn't invincible," he said.
A year later, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I knew I had dreamed of it all my life – jumping in front of our home team at the Olympics, I don’t know of a better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first song – Stream by Heather Small – which resonated with him at the opening of the Olympics and still evoked goose bumps in him.

Mickelson, who was out of shape, finished on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
Phil Mickelson would have set a record on Sunday when he played in the 47th Ryder Cup game, but he would have had to tweak his form to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played at the event held every two years for the record-twelfth time, was sent by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's fourballs and foursomes to the bench.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case in the U.S., the five-times-principal spent his day alternating between cheerleading and working on a game in a row that he hoped would fix what was bothering him.
This 48-year-old player has never been the most direct of drivers, not even at the peak of his career, so it is not an ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National course, where a long rugged terrain routinely punishes stray shots.
And unless the golf course itself is worrying enough, Mickelson faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has won all four of his games this week with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, in his ninth Sunday match.
If the Americans, who had four points less, started 12 separate swords, escaped a quick approach, Mickelson's sword could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man and added nothing else.
"He totally understands the role he had today, patted me on the back, put his arm around my shoulders and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He trusts himself so much.
He is a member of the Straw Hall and has been so beneficial to these teams in the past week as well.
I don't think I ever imagined he'd play two swords.
I imagined more, but that's how it evolved, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be involved, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will surpass Nick Fald’s record in most Ryder Cup Wests played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that never reached the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson scored 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk says his presence has brought some intangible results to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s funny, he likes to make fun of people and he’s a great companion in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players also had fun going to see him this week, which was fun to watch.
It’s much more than just a game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a great lead towards the last days’ singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
Dane made his debut at the 1997 game in Valderrama, where the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but reached the finish line with a close win of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You have to keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama, as well as in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only closely,” said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching them win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday in 2018 to lead Le Golf National 10-6.
So history and every member of that team has shown me that it's not over.
Tomorrow you will be bored.
Go out there and do all the right things.
It's not over until all those points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that's to try and get that trophy, and that's what we're focused on.
I said I would focus on the 12 players on our side, but we also know what to do on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn, pleased with the performance of his players on the difficult golf course, added: “I could never do it myself.
There's another animal waiting for us tomorrow.
Individual performances are being prepared tomorrow and that is too difficult.
It’s great to be out with a partner when it’s going well, but when you’re there to be on your own, your golfer’s capacity is fully vetted.
That’s the message you have to give to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best out of himself too.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will ensure that his players play better as individuals than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these great upheavals when he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn, to then end up defeated when Europe achieved the “Miracle in Medina”.
“I remember every damn word of it,” Ben Crenshaw, the captain from 1999, answered when asked how he encouraged his players to go to the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you want to start quickly like in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When this pace goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the mid-games.
We set up the line-up accordingly and made sure the boys felt like you know, like we were supposed to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the top game against players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the top half.
“I went with that group of boys in that order because I think it covers the whole journey,” Bjorn said of his singles selection.
German new warship delayed yet again
Germany’s newest naval frigate was recognized in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but will not be available for at least another year due to faulty systems and a snowy coastline, local media reported.
The commissioning of the lead ship Rheinland-Pfalz, a brand new Baden-Wurttemberg-class frigate, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, citing an army spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to become part of the Navy in 2014, but the difficult problems after delivery made the fate of this ambitious project unpleasant.
As a replacement for the aging Bremen-class frigates, four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will serve, which the Navy ordered in 2007.
It is obvious that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship ballistic missiles and certain hidden technologies, such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important features include long maintenance times – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside domestic ports.
However, the constant delays mean that the top naval vessels – which were supposed to allow Germany to send forces overseas – will be obsolete by the time they are put into operation, Die Zeit notes.
The infamous F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the manufacturer after the handover.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media quoted a number of crucial "software bugs and defects on metal elements" defects that would render a warship unusable in combat.
The software glitches were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessel would be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors – half of the personnel needed on Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been shown to be significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add future innovations.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfal is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defects in metal elements, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – is also a problem.
It is said that from the original 2.2 billion euros, the price has risen to a staggering 3.1 billion euros.
Problems with the latest frigates have gained importance, especially in light of recent warnings that German naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, confirmed that the navy was indeed “out of ships capable of deploying.”
The official said the problems continued to pile up as old ships were decommissioned but no replacements were provided.
He lamented that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wurttemberg class were capable of becoming part of the Navy's equipment.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Lives of Bats
New research is underway at a bat settlement in the Scottish Highlands to uncover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the research findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities of this species.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the whistling and the smallest and brown long-eared and aquatic bats in the Inverewe Gardens botanical garden in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in the key areas of this bat habitat to monitor bat activity throughout the year.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Professional audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and what each species is doing.
Subsequently, a habitat map and a report will be published, which will create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by individual species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating meadows, and best practices in maintaining wooded areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have been largely declining over the past century.
They are threatened by the construction and territorial development that affect the colonies and the natural environment.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as fly traps and chemical treatment of building materials and cat attacks can also pose a risk.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to track bugs and obstacles in flight.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has trained specialists who regularly carry out surveys, colony checks and sometimes rescue work.
The organisation has even set up the first and only dedicated bat reserve at Three in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Housing manager David Thompson says it's the ideal area for them.
"We have a great area for bats here in Threat," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees, and the best habitats.
But there’s still too much we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to survive.”
He stresses the importance of controlling bats before starting maintenance work on real estate, as it is possible that the unwitting destruction of one nursery can kill up to 400 females and cubs, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass, disturb or destroy their colonies.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to put their hand to the work and help.
She said, "There's a lot to learn about our bats and a lot of species that we don't know how well their populations are doing."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations and his lawyers are going to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations “fake news” and said people “want to make themselves visible” by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German daily Der Spiegel, which reported the allegations.
The Portuguese striker was accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the case, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
A few hours after the indictment was released, Ronaldo, 33, spoke to his 142 million followers in a live video on Instagram, calling the information “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the five-time Golden Ball Camera winner said.
"They want to feed on my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their job.
I’m happy and I’m fine,” the player said with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are set to indict Der Spiegel on unsubstantiated charges that they described as “unacceptable reporting of suspicion in a private area.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral damages equivalent to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent times."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel suite and at a casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the casino, where, according to documentation filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada, he allegedly sexually assaulted her.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told her he was “99 percent” “good” and “1 percent” disappointed.
The documents claim Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for the sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and had photos of her injuries taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and feared "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to reinstate the proceedings because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the attack, Ronaldo was one step away from joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and was bought by the famous Italian club Juve for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million this summer.
Brexit: UK will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
The UK will “forever regret” if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, company secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “worrying” that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"A deal is necessary," Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of delays at the borders in the event of no Brexit deal could cost jobs.
At the Burnaston plant, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis cars are produced, nearly 150,000 cars were produced last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“My view is that if the UK suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would see production stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer in Burnaston.
Other automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, are spreading fears of leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade works.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini car plant in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers say are risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operating on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts from suppliers in the UK and the EU delivered to cars made to order within 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be disruption at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and a shortage of spare parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to have more than one day in stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, halting production.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plans to revive future relations with the EU were "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks."
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal, which will allow, as I say, not only the current success, but also the grasping of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that we need to be absolutely able to continue with what is a highly successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production will be halted, but in the long run it warns that the added costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately be at the expense of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is the chairman of the trade unions in the plant, said that the members of the trade union organization are increasingly concerned: “I have experience that once these places are gone, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have put in place a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, White House says
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s high-level meeting with acting attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “rescheduled for another week” as the fight for the post of chief justice continues with Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates interference in Russian elections, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and possible judicial obstruction by the president.
Whether Trump dismisses the acting attorney general and threatens Mueller’s independence, Washington’s gossip has been feeding for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, however, he arrived at the White House surrounded by reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump said he would “prefer” not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed so as not to interfere with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying a full Senate vote once again.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared in Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date has not yet been set, it may be this week, it may be necessary to postpone it for another week in view of everything else that is going on at the Supreme Court.
But we will see, and I will always communicate current information to the media.”
Some reporters disagree: Sanders has not held a press conference with the White House since Sept. 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said too few press conferences were not caused by an aversion to the "theater" of television reporters, even though she said, "I don't agree with the fact that they're going to perform."
She then suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is holding more Q&A sessions than any president before him," she added, without providing evidence.
The conference will continue, Sanders said, but “if the press had the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it would undoubtedly be better than talking to me.
We’ve been trying, and you’ve seen that we’ve been doing that in the last few weeks, and there’s going to be a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly receives questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting senior officials.
Separate press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why with his relaxed and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the assembled reporters.
Health minister tells EU NHS Scotland staff not to fear Brexit
The health minister wrote to EU staff working at the NHS in Scotland to express her gratitude and wish for them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman sent the letter six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to settle the costs of claims for the settlement status of EU citizens working in transferred public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal continue and are heading towards the expected decisions this autumn.
But the British government is also taking steps to prepare for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very upsetting time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to assure you once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the performance of health services and benefit both patients and the communities we serve.
“Scotland is absolutely your home and our fervent wish is that you stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie advances emergency surgery after head injury
Tigers forward Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday’s 31-27 defeat to rival Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee’s Mike Organ said.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He came to the side line and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline, then placed him on a stretcher and prepared him for further assessment.
A Tennessee state official told Chrisz Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said there were “no details yet on the type/range of the injury” and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore in a red T-shirt, is going through his first season for the state of Tennessee after being transferred from Illinois.
Before the end of the game on Saturday, he had five total surgeries, which means a total of 18 surgeries per season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when they buy property in the UK, with extra money being used to help the homeless as part of Tory’s new plans.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn's move to attract young voters.
The increase in the obligation of a higher property tax will apply to non-taxable persons in the UK
<0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Buyers from abroad will pay a higher property purchase tax when they buy a property in the UK, with the extra money being used to help homeless people, Theresa May announced today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters with promises of more affordable accommodation and a focus on high-income people.
The increase in property tax will apply to individuals and businesses who do not pay tax in the UK, with the extra money boosting the government’s efforts to fight over-sleeping.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current obligation to pay property tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and purchases for rental purposes, can reach up to three percent.
It is expected that the state treasury will increase funds by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
Estimates say that 13 per cent of non-UK residents buy newly built properties in London, pushing up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get to the top of the house rankings.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become ghost towns precisely because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a property tax cut to help more young people move into their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of keeping property prices high by taking up land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to withdraw quotas from affordable homes to correct the “disadvantages of home” in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced an eye-catching series of proposed housing reforms, including rent management and an end to “safe” evictions.
It also wants to increase the powers of committees to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I wanted to dedicate my efforts as Prime Minister to renewing the British Dream – so that every new generation has a better life.
And that means fixing our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and shape their lives.
However, it can’t be right to make it easy for entities that don’t live in the UK and for foreign companies to be able to buy homes just like hard-working UK residents.
For many people, the dream of a home is too distant, and the shame of sleeping without a roof over your head is too real.”
Jack Ross: ‘My highest ambition is to lead Scotland’
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "highest ambition" is to become manager of Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scott is enjoying the challenge of reviving the Northeast club, which currently holds third place in the Premier League, just three degrees below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading the Scottish Premier League back to St Mirren last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got rank B and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and that’s always something that pulls me back.
But that opportunity would only come if I was successful at managing the club.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland managers were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic boss says he felt no anxiety about the succession of such established names in such a large club, having previously rejected foreplay from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me at the time would have been measured by the question of whether I could bring this club back to the Premier League.
"Because of the structure and equipment at this club, he is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to bring him back, but I think I’d feel successful if I could bring the club back.”
Ross has only had a career as a manager for three years, having previously served as an assistant manager at Dumarton and spent 15 months as a coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third group and transformed St Mirren from an incipient decline to a champions title winner the following season.
And Ross says he has a much better feeling now than he has ever had in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"They were probably real crossroads," he recalls the time when Alloa took over.
“I really believed that leadership was right for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange, because I was good, making good money and enjoying a reasonable height.
But playing can be challenging.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still go through them in terms of the stress and pressure of the job, but I just feel good in leadership.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now I do, I feel like I’m feeling the most in my adult life right now.”

Research has found that a great time to pint is on a Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has boosted revenue for British pubs facing difficulties, but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
Figures show that pub and bar groups saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July – but restaurant revenue declined by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA, the consultancy that produced the final reports, said: “Stable sunshine and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June, with a 2.8 percent increase in pub attendance but restaurants being hit even harder.
The decline in restaurant sales by 1.8 percent in June worsened in July.
Bars and pubs that were tempting to drink were doing the same as restaurants had done before.
Pubs, whose main sales are from food, also suffered from the sun, albeit not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
“Between controlled values and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent for the month, while food sales fell three percent.”
Paul Newman, from the leisure and hospitality analytics firm, said: “These results are a continuation of a trend that has continued since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant chains continue to struggle, although the annual decline in sales of 4.8 percent will be particularly painful in light of ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer couldn’t be a worse time for food business operators, and time will tell if the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring much-needed relief.”
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand presentation.
The Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK’s pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, an established industry benchmark in the sector.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they keep secret from their parents.
One in five children – aged just 11 – has a secret social media account that hides it from parents and educators, research shows.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in “fake Instagram pages”
Reports have raised concerns that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students said they have a “master account” that their parents know about.
One in five children – as young as 11 years old – create social media accounts that they keep secret from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in “fake Instagram accounts” sharing photos.
Reports point to concerns that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of students said they have a beautified “master” account that their parents know about, while also having a private account.
A mother who stumbled onto her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found that her teenage daughter was urging others to “rape her.”
Research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Association of Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-old students have two profiles, with half admitting to keeping private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and educators can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of the athletes” in the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics committee as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the management committee.
Doyle is the most-acclaimed athlete and Chairman Ian Beattie has described the move as a great opportunity for those in the sport’s leadership as those who will benefit from her far-reaching experience internationally over the past decade.
“Eilidh has a great deal of respect for the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are confident that it will be of great benefit to athletics in Scotland as a member of the committee,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be really helpful and help lead the sport in Scotland.
The American, who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, won a total of four gold medals and is now a regular BBC expert, could not walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had an attack a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time would tell if I would recover or to what extent.
It’s exhausting, but I’ve made a full recovery, I’ve learned to walk again, and today I’m doing exercise!
Thanks for all the encouraging news!”
A milk extractor that evokes the comparison of mothers to cows shares opinions online
A company that manufactures breast pumps has split online opinion with an ad that compares nursing mothers to nursing cows.
As part of the launch of the “world’s first silent wearable vacuum cleaner,” consumer technology company Envi has released a music video exaggerating the freedom the new vacuum cleaner gives nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay with cows to a song with the lyrics: “Yes, I’m feeling it, but you don’t see any tail” and “In case you didn’t notice I don’t have udders, here are my breasts.”
The choir continues: “Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I feed my dear ones with milk.”
However, the ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked an online controversy.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and received mixed reactions from those who saw it, with many saying it sheds light on the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very poor decision to abuse cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, they have to be pregnant and give birth in order to give milk, but their babies are taken away a few days after giving birth,” says one of the comments.

Another comment: “Clearly traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?”
Someone else added, "The ad is completely off."
There were also those who defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she considered the song "contagious".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd get that pump if I was still breastfeeding.
I feel exactly like a cow when I'm being suckled.
The commercial's a little crazy, but it's relevant.
It’s a brilliant product,” one user wrote.
Another added: “It’s a fun ad aimed at mothers who suck milk (often at work or on the toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.
It’s not an advertisement to praise or curse the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women shows everyone dancing with discreet suction cups hidden under their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the observation that a lot of women who suck milk report feeling like cows.
However, the Elvie vacuum cleaner is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and hides beautifully in a breastfeeding bra, so it gives women freedom of movement, the ability to hold the baby and even walk when vacuuming.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD for mothers, added: “The Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a distinctive and provocative launch.
By creating a parallel between nursing mothers and nursing cows, we wanted to highlight the milk extraction and all the challenges associated with it, while showing the fun and reliable incredible feeling of freedom that the new suction cup will provide.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s vacuum cleaner has come to the fore.
During London Fashion Week, one of the two mothers, designer Marta Jakubowski, who was just using the product, appeared on the pier.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children rose sharply despite the fact that the monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, especially because the harsh rhetoric and principles introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult to place children with accompaniment.
Most of the escorts were traditionally made up of undocumented immigrants who were afraid of endangering their ability to stay in the country, so they claimed to belong to the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households must provide fingerprints and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who had applied for unaccompanied minor status.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
Up to 80 percent of people who are sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue to prosecute them," Mr Albence said.
In an effort to speed up the handling of children's issues, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, instead of the previous standard 60 days, according to asylum officials.
Many appear via video-conferencing calls rather than in person to declare their case a legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for assistance will be quickly deported.
The longer a child is in foster care, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbursts of anger or attempts to escape, asylum officials say, citing reports from the system over the past few months.
Lawyers say these concerns are heightened in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where there are signs that a child is suffering, more likely to go unnoticed, precisely because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a tent camp without enough time for emotional preparation or saying goodbye to friends could trigger the trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria says U.S., French and Turkish ‘occupation forces’ should withdraw immediately
During a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for the return of Syrian refugees home, even as the country is already in its eighth year of war.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces on Syrian territory were illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "it will be dealt with accordingly."
"He must surrender immediately and unconditionally," he said at the meeting.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terrorism in Syria is almost over,” with more than 360,000 people killed and millions more displaced since 2011.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight in this holy battle until we rid all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “any illegally present foreigners.”
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad and advising them.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
In handing over the refugees, Moualem said conditions of return were good for them and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that made the refugees reluctant to return.
"We have reached out to international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no recovery aid will be available for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib’s last resort has created an opportunity to move forward in political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, pointed out that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military intervention would target jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters with ties to al-Qaeda, who "will be exterminated."
United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition will soon be held to propose a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying that the panel’s work should be limited to “checking the articles of the existing constitution” and issued a warning against intervention.
Why Trump will win in the second half
By this logic, Donald Trump would win another election in 2020 if, as many liberal observers probably hope, the indictment and scandals did not prematurely end his presidency.
In that case, it would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential season finale in history!”
So far, there have been no signs of follow-up fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has averaged 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has increased cable TV viewership to 3.5 million watching major nighttime news.
“It’s the heat that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the host of the ABC’s “Designated Survivor” drama about a cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy and comedy writer on Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he's funny,' said Mrs. Scovell.
It's the meaning of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story set in Washington could predetermine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and benefit the global economy.
Tuning is a luxury that only the most privileged followers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond whether or not you’re an informed citizen as you watch a panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward uses “deep backup” resources for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“dressing arrogance” as the Washington Post put it), and the ramifications of Daniel’s disgusting portrayal.
I’m not going to look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he does and what makes the show feel real is that he feeds you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the Pawn Stars documentary about the rotating N.F.L. Trump show in which he honors Kim Jong-un.

When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny outside on the north bank of Kauai 80 degrees, but he was holed up inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't break away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood up to the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was in doubt.
“I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
"I think it was supposed to be a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from the outside flows into the tightest domestic mid-term elections
Unsurprisingly, the 17th District of Pennsylvania is experiencing an influx of funding due to the reorganization of congressional districts, which generated two office holders fighting for the same seat.
This has recently led to the transformation of the suburban Pittsburgh district by Democratic district Republican Conor Lamb – who won another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is pitted against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania’s old 12th congressional district, which strongly overlaps with the new 17th congressional district.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties had been unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans, the maps were redrawn.
The race in the new 17th district was sparked by a fierce financial dispute between the financial branches of the main party, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the March 18th congressional district special election.
This seat was occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politicians give Democrats a slight lead.
U.S. Considers Fineing El Salvador for Supporting China, Resigns
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under moderate pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and was staying at a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted the Trump administration’s organizing team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomatic chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan further,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the fines were considered only against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including funds for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included cuts to financial aid and focused on visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rate.
With ongoing internal negotiations, North American and Central American officials have postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity following similar talks the previous year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants heading to the US.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made clear they wanted to continue negotiations and effectively end any fines being considered for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now tasked with resolving a conference currently scheduled for mid-October, as part of the signal the administration is putting on the talks, diplomats said.
And three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new intransigent news from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on conditions of anonymity.
Their sources have been confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the government’s executive branch and has also spoken on condition of anonymity.
History of studies
The final nail in the coffin could be Robert Mueller’s report from a special committee on Mr. Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is now much evidence in public records.
Mueller’s investigation is also reportedly looking at whether Mr. Trump’s campaign included a collusion with Russia over the attack on our election.
If there were an exchange of parties in Congress, Mr. Trump would have to take responsibility before that body, just as he is preparing to stand before voters again, and in the end a jury of his colleagues would probably be waiting for him.
That’s a whole host of “ifs,” and I don’t want to argue that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable – as with similar politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice before us that will affect how long the suffering will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, all that was needed was for the Western powers to stand up to him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such critical moments that accelerate or slow down the inexorable course of democracy.
Americans are now facing several similar critical moments.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been on edge ever since the report announced that he had proposed secretly recording the president last year and speculated that he was not in a medical condition to hold the presidency.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, The Times' version is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if F.B.I. Brett Kavanaugh’s newly requested investigation is not complete or fair – or what if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite compelling allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And most importantly, will we be voting in midterms for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long dark night.
But I believe that we will not fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, on the Sabbath, she sent me to light candles on a table with a swastika.
How could I not be optimistic about our future with such a legacy?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about a clash with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory over the Austrians after an impressive draw in Spain on Villarreal’s pitch earlier this month would give them great hope to advance from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from appearing on the pitch for the first time in the season until Villarreal's 2–2 draw, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard for bigger things.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the fight with the belief that we could grab something and we took the point.
Maybe we could have multiplied it in the end, but overall the draw was probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second half we got better and we were better again.
On Thursday, it will be another big European night.
I hope that we can get three points, but it will be difficult, because in the last game they played a good result. But with the audience behind me, I am sure that we can push and it will turn out well.
Last year was a tough one, with all my injuries and changes at the club, but I feel really good about it now.
The team is strong and the guys really enjoy it, the training is good too.
I hope we can put our backs on it now, put last season behind us and be successful.”
Women are worried about saving for retirement.
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how to take care of them, few people talked about it with family members.
About half of the people in the nationwide study said they discussed the price of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t want to talk to him about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of national life insurance.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family for caregiving unless you reveal your wishes to them in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how to receive care, as these factors can play a big role in pricing.
Ask your financial advisor: A financial advisor can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care can be financed, for example, with traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid cash life insurance to help you pay for these expenses, or with your own insurance using your own funds – as long as you have the money.
Create your own legal documents: Avoid legal battles while you can.
Identify a health care representative who will be a trustworthy person who will oversee your medical care and ensure that doctors follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate on your own.
Also consider writing a power of attorney for your finances.
You will choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are not qualified to do so yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your old parent urgently needs a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so you are ready.
“It’s not just finances that are at stake, but, for example, what are the names of the treating doctors?” asks Martin.
"Where are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have the plan ready at hand.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, adding that the death toll is expected to rise further.
With communications out of order, the relief forces were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about the city of Palu and the regency of Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, and its population in 2017 was estimated at 379,800 people.
The city was just celebrating its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching more than 300 km (180 mi) along the coast in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main components of the economy of Central Sulawesi province are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morawali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggalu have been hit several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The tsunami also struck west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and earthquakes regularly occur here.
Here is a list of some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh province.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck the south of Indonesia's most populous island of Java, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A light earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh province and caused destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastating effects of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami formed, but more than 100 died due to falling buildings.
2018: A powerful earthquake hits the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily imprisoned.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
According to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin, 29, who lives in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, disturbing reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest.
When, according to the police report, his female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, Palin took her phone.
Palin has been sent to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held for an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reports.
According to the network’s report, he appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he felt “definitely innocent” when asked to comment.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, meaning he could face up to a year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
At the same time, he was charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which is punishable by a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has faced a criminal complaint.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The alleged attack on police was reported by his mother, Sarah Palin.
The case is currently before the Alaska War Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, violating the reporting of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
He allegedly punched his girlfriend in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by groups of war veterans for associating her son’s violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his son’s service in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake and Tsunami: Hundreds Dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks are out of service and the number of victims is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck directly at the tip of the island of Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There were videos on social media depicting the moment of the disaster.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand exceptional death penalty for NYC terror suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people — an exceptional sentence that has not been handed down for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly attacked a bike path along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan neighborhood in October using a rented Home Depot truck to sweep away pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to defend the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused a number of injuries - this is how the terms of the intention to grant the death penalty are defined, according to a document approved by the Southern District of New York court.
According to court documents, both of these numbers would mean the possibility of the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 crimes, including charges of murder for extortion, which are commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and preparation,” prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov’s act was carried out as heinous, cruel and perverse.
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, pain, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlijo, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucov.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been 10 years since the Southern District of New York last handed down the death penalty.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was actually carried out was in connection with a federal case in New York in 1953, when a couple, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, were executed for conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs sat in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed minimal remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police also said he had demanded that the Islamic State flag be hoisted in a hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s federal public defenders, said they were “obviously disappointed” by the prosecutors’ decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea and a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone concerned," Patton said.
Saipov’s team of lawyers had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MPs say NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged to “mobilize the army of the people” during today’s protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians must “feel pressure” from Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested, he should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said during a march in Birmingham that the UK “would be out by now” if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
But the problem that Mrs May faces in reconciling her ranks, where there is a deep rift, has been highlighted by the EU’s pro-remain Conservatives, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep her Chequers compromise plan running under attack from Brexit supporters, pro-remainers and the EU itself.
The allies insist that they will continue to try to make a deal with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and ‘chaos’.
Mr. Bone announced that the Leave Means Leave group would gather in Solihull, where he wanted to “put a stop to Chequers.”
He suggested to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out today,” he said.
MP Wellingborough added: “I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to give up Chequers.”
To show his opposition to the EU, he said: “We didn’t fight world wars to have to listen.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The idea that British citizens would change their minds and want to stay is totally misguided.’
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who also took part in the march, told reporters: “I am simply saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him, and he is not liked by our party members or our activists who are currently filling the streets to be elected at all.
Forget about Chequers and start listening.’
In a scathing message to Mrs May, she says: “Ministerial presidents will keep their jobs if they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said conservative politicians must "get into an uncomfortable situation" if they want to betray their decision taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s about trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re standing here today to tell them ‘we won’t let you do that.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the pressure.
“We are now mobilizing the army of the people of this country who secured us the victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent and proud Britain that governs itself,” he said.
Proponents of staying in the Union meanwhile marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists waved anti-Brexit banners to the Conservatives after the party’s weekend launch.
Labour MP Lord Adonis scoffed at conservatives for problems with the party’s app security after the start of the conference.
“These are the people who, in their own words, can provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus, for trouble-free borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's all a farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he said.
Warren Plans to ‘Properly Think’ of Running for President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "think carefully about running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future Saturday at a town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November against Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been at the center of speculation that she could stand up to Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at City Hall since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that the time had come “for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that means a woman at the top.”
Suspect arrested for shooting Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., said on Saturday they had arrested the suspect in Friday's shooting of LSU basketball player Waydo Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson at 11:00 ET News Conference.
A video of Friday's shooting was released with a request to identify the man captured on the recording.
Sims, 20, was shot dead Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that was not consistent with life,” police commander Murphy J. Paul told the media via the 247sports website on Saturday.
Wayde was trying to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to moving around the crime scene, carrying a gun, and admitting to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was detained without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The six-foot-six-inch Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, 10 of which were last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of world champion, when the team's direction put him in the hands of victory over Sebastian Vettel
As soon as Valtteri Bottas finished in Saturday’s qualifying before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes’ team management would play a big role in the race.
From the pole position Bottas had a good start and almost got rid of Hamilton when in the first two corners he defended his position and called on Vettel to attack the teammate.
Vettel drove into the depot first and let Hamilton catch up with the cars circling at the tail of the group, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes rider rode into the depot a lap later and, after the exit, placed himself behind Vettel. However, Hamilton went ahead and in a close duel, the Ferrari driver had to reluctantly leave the inner lane free to defend himself in the third corner after a double manoeuvre.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the field and at the end of the first lap was in the lead on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race as he held on to the original tyres as long as possible to focus on the quick finish and be able to take away Kimi Raikkonen's fourth position.
He eventually made it to the depot in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he was unable to increase his pace and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It’s a tough day because Valtteri has been doing a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he behaved like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done a fantastic job and the reward is the first two places,” Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump scoffed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at Saturday’s assembly for insisting she didn’t publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, he made no direct mention of Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead stating that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were “evil and disgusting and lying.”
“One thing that could happen, and a wonderful thing that happens in the last days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see these people, how angry and evil and disgusting and lying,” he said.
“If you look at the issue and the publication and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, can you vouch for the leak?
Remember her answer... you posted the document – ‘Oh, oh, what?’
Oh, no.
She didn't."
Well, wait a minute.
We have published ... No, I mean no,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July and the information leaked in early September – but Feinstein refused to let the leak happen from her office.
"I did not conceal Dr. Ford's allegations, nor did I disclose the details of the case," Feinstein said, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I did exactly what she asked me to do."
However, the president, who spoke at a meeting on Saturday evening, did not seem to believe her words: “I will tell you that this is really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused by three women of sexual harassment, and suggested that Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
“They are determined to take back power by any means available.
You see the vileness, the abomination, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to trample into the ground to get back to power and to the helm,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars corrected Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning Saturday's rematch in Dundee, which ended 5-3.
The Giants soon took the two-man lead thanks to the intervention of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were able to settle for home before Dwyer returned the Giants to the lead.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard then tied Dundee again, after which Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for the Adam Keefe team, who managed to beat Dundee 2-1 on Friday in Belfast.
Both teams met for the fourth time in the season, with all three previous games dominated by Giants players.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, with Kendall McFaul's assistance, while David Rutherford scored Beauvillier's second goal four minutes later.
The first third was wild when Sullivan got home back into the game at 13:10, and then Matt Marquardt prepared a goal for Cownie, who compared at 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, the Giants went into the booths for the first break, after all, only in the lead, when he recorded his second goal of the evening at the end of the first third.
The hosts regrouped and Bouchard again managed to catch up with a goal from the power play in the time of 27:37.
Co-operation between Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen win the game for the first time in the second third, and the same player insures his team's management in the middle of the final third.
The Giants, who have now lost their fourth of their last five games, will play another game at home in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies to Allow Hundreds of People on Board Plane to Escape Earthquake
The head of air traffic control in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he died while overseeing a plane with hundreds of people on board safely take off.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake rocked the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks flooded the area and many people were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But even as colleagues of 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung fled to save their lives, he refused to leave his seat in the wildly wobbling control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pal.
He stayed in his position to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped down from the control tower, thinking he was sliding.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait told Australia ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter transport from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which was taken to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken by this news," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities expressed concern that the number of deaths could reach thousands. The agency responsible for dealing with the disaster said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The death toll continues to rise as many bodies still remain unrecovered under the wreckage and many of them still remain unaccounted for by rescuers,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said in a statement.
Waves in the devastated Palu have reached a height of up to six meters. Mass funerals will be held in the city on Sunday.
Both military and civilian aircraft bring aid and supplies to the affected areas.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings more bodies here.
There's a shortage of drinking water.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could be worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pal on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you to work day and night and complete all the tasks needed to evacuate.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Indonesia has been hit by earthquakes in Lombok this year that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now claims one person is missing after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed in a lagoon on one of the Micronesian islands in the Pacific, now said one person was missing, initially saying all passengers and a crew of 47 were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that it was unable to find one passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests to provide details of this passenger, his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that a total of seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in care on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
However, what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before landing.
Some witnesses thought the plane had overtaken the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was landing from a very low altitude.
"That was very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to get through the water to a strip deep to the emergency exits of the sinking aircraft.
He also said that the cabin crew panicked and screamed and that he himself had suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby on the docking pier helped rescue passengers by using an inflatable boat to carry them to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network reports that a total of 111 people have died in accidents involving PNGs over the past two decades, but no accidents have occurred with Air Niuguni.
Analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The prosecution ended its speech on Saturday in this case in which a man is repeatedly tried for burning a woman alive in the state of Mississippi in 2014.
The US Department of Justice, in the person of its analyst Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours and provided expert opinions in the field of intelligence analysis.
A jury analyst sketched out a scenario of how he used the cell phone records of 29 defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was in the Chambers company on the night of her death, which contradicted his previous statement, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When cell phone records showed that he had spent the night with Chambers, he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, who was then visited by the police.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in town on the day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford’s car that night, Sanford said he was “lying because my car was in Nashville that night.”
Another disagreement was that Tellis had stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks on the day she died.
However, cell phone records indicate that the two knew each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, phone calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be heard by the jury later that day.
High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
Hip hop trio wants to deal with negative opinions about this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The Bristol-based band High Breed says hip hop has moved from its beginnings with political messages and solutions to social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and re-populate conscious hip hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a revival in the recent past thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black woman?
NY schoolteacher sues couple for firing after 'racist' text message
A New York schoolteacher is suing a couple for their discriminatory dismissal after she received a text message wrongly sent from her mother, in which she was labeled “another black woman” by a text message.
The couple denied that they were racists and compared the lawsuit to “blackmail.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay when she found out on her first day at work in 2016 that her children’s new caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to the Maurices.
When she understood her faux pas, the “worried” Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, saying that her outgoing caregiver, who was African-American, had worked really poorly and was expecting a Filipino woman instead, the New York Post reported.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one job and sent home by Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for being fired from her job and is seeking compensation of $350 per day for a six-month engagement for which she was initially hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that this is not happening,” she told the Post this Friday, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.”
However, the two returned the blow, saying that they were not racists, but that the termination of Ms Maurice's employment was an appropriate measure, because they feared that they could no longer trust her after the insult.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We are not racist,” her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
"But would you put your child in the hands of someone you treated rudely, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Oh, come on."
Plasco likened the lawsuit to “extortion” and said his wife was only caring for a two-month-old child and was in a “very difficult situation”.
“Would you drive after someone like that?
That's not a nice thing at all," the investment banker said.
Although the legal dispute still persists, the jury on social media very quickly convicted the couple for their behavior and logic.
Publishers of Paddington Bear Stories Feared Readers Disagree With Talking Bear, Latest News Shows
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, told the rapporteur: “It’s difficult to empathize with someone reading it for the first time before it’s even published.
It’s really fun to know that now that we know Paddington’s great success.”
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book about a little teddy bear, was very disappointed that his work was rejected, adding on the 60th anniversary of the book's publication that became a "sweet bitter" dot after his death last year.
To Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of her family", she added that her father was very proud of his eventual success.
"He was quite a quiet man, never boastful," she said.
“But because Paddington was such a real character to him, it was like having a child who achieved something you can be really proud of.
I think he looked at Paddington's success that way.
Even though it was only his creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all his successes only to Paddington.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louise Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors were trying to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that it was really bad and that he didn't expect her to get out of it," Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad telling me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
That's how I did it.
I said, "Tash, I love you so much, darling.
I'll be there with you soon.
I'll be there with you.
The drugs the doctors had given her to keep her heart running were slowly losing their effectiveness and leaving her body.
She died shortly after, and it was as if everything had closed.
I just had to sit and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it to myself.”
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, without revealing what a difficult ordeal she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
“I kept my head down, tears running down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt an overwhelming sense of understanding for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Mourning women send postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send out postcards of the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers where people can seek support.
Mrs. Davis’ son Tyler was only 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and took his own life at the age of 18.
"I don't want any other parent to have to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs Davis, who is 45 and lives in Lydney, said her son was a gifted young chef with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile could light up any room.”
However, before his death, he quit his job because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found the still body of his sibling after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis says, “I’m constantly worried about how it’s going to affect his life.”
Ms Davis suggested the postcards “to inform people that they have people who are willing to help them and can talk to them, even if they are their friends.
Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who is an elderly friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, who had been her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
"He didn't tell me he was feeling down, or depressed, or anything at all," he explains.
“A few days before Christmas, we saw a change in his behavior.
The worst thing was on Christmas Day – when the kids opened the presents and didn’t even look at them, nothing.”
She said that the death of her partner was a huge trauma for them, but that they have to get over it: “Such a thing can make a complete hole in the family.
It tore us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on balance as the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought we could get something he was actually asking for — an investigation in a time of limitation, with limited scope — we could bring a little bit of unity into it,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “disintegrate” because both sides would be buried in partisan positions.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to open an investigation?
Their resistance is well-timed.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, on November 6th, and if the Republicans do badly as expected, it will lead to their fundamental weakening in attempts to force their desired man to the post of supreme court of this country.
George W. Bush telephoned senators, lobbied for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for President Bush, and met with his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary at the time.
What happens if the FBI compiles its report?
The Senate will vote on it, and there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
Still, it’s unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which allowed Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and testify before the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea under Kim "decreased"
The number of refugees from North to South Korea has fallen since the beginning of Kim Jong-un’s rule seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 defections in the past year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park also said that this was due to stricter controls at the border between North Korea and China and higher rates required by smugglers at the border.
Pyongyang has not issued a public statement.
The vast majority of refugees from the North are now being offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them are fleeing through China, with which North Korea has the longest border and is easier to cross than in the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views refugees as illegal migrants and not as refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South – which are still technically at war – have improved markedly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on stalled denuclearization talks.
This was the historic June meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on broad terms of cooperation in the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho accused the United States of making no progress on sanctions.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we can unilaterally disarm ourselves,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Democratic minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temperament made him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remark in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if any woman had ever performed such a play, they would have called it ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said in her response to Kavanaugh’s Thursday statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while they were still in their teens.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and choking while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, saying their charges against him were a “grotesque and coordinated attack” orchestrated by liberals who failed to get over Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony proved he was unable to serve on the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he leaned on the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi responded in the negative when asked if she would seek Kavanaugh’s appeal if confirmed, even if Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll tell you this - if he's not telling Congress the truth, then he's not only qualified to serve on the Supreme Court, he's not qualified to serve on the court he's working on now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she had concerns about Kavanaugh’s potential returns in court under the Affordable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade because he is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearings preceding his confirmation in office, Kavanaugh avoided answering the question of whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court’s rulings.
“There’s no time for a hysterical, preconceived person to go to court and expect us to just say, ‘Oh, that’s wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
And women have to rule it.
After verbal outbursts, months and years of resentment, she couldn't get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continues: “I was helped a lot by a woman who worked as a headmistress and who told me that she also cries when she is angry, but she developed a technique, which means that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘You might think I’m crying because I’m sad.
But I'm angry."
And so she went on.
And I think that’s great.”
Tears are acceptable as a means of responding to anger, in part because they are misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job where I worked in an office dominated by men. Once there I expressed my inexpressible anger with a cry. But the older, always cold manager, whom I was always a little afraid, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up the stairs.
"Never show them you're crying," she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an affair aboard the Monkey Business and had to withdraw from the fight, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she could not explore the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," she told me, laughing after 30 years.
“There were seven other candidates running, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
But because the campaign had been going on for a long time, she was unable to keep up with the fundraising, and so she pledged not to go into the match unless she earned $2 million in contributions.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1,000 to a male candidate would only give $250.
"Does he think I'll get a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally implement the campaign, she was completely overwhelmed by her emotions – as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with a system that made it difficult for her to raise money and focus on voters rather than delegates, and out of anger over sexism, that she was completely choking on anger.
"You might think I had a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder said of how the press reacted to her.
“And you might have thought that my main sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my gravestone.
"Cry?"
Why China-U.S. trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening salvo of the U.S.-China trade war was deafening, and while the battle is far from over, according to experts, the rift between the countries is beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the US president, gave the first warning this year by taxing Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
Most of the most significant escalations, however, came to light this week when new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) were announced, effectively taxing half of China’s trade exports to the US.
Beijing has responded each time, most recently by imposing tariffs on five to 10 percent of the 60 billion U.S. imports.
China has tried to repay the US with the same coin, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will kneel.
Even if China wanted Washington to return to its original ways, it would mean yielding to its demands. But public submission to American demands would be utterly humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts think that if Beijing could play its cards correctly, the U.S.-led trade war could positively support China in the long run, as it would reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact is that quick policy decisions by Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would trigger an economic corkscrew in both countries. This is much more dangerous than observers have so far admitted,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria ready to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help in rebuilding the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions were improving in the country.
“Today’s situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to normalcy.
Now all conditions are met for the voluntary return of refugees who were forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that were aimed at their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million people have fled Syria since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people still live in the country in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any help in building a devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe responds strongly to victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
Evria won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the brink of trouble in France.
The U.S. has now lost for the sixth consecutive time on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn and his team scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the US.
The US star, Phil Mickelson, who suffered most of the tour, then shot the ball into the water on 3 pairs of the 16th hole and conceded the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari then shined in all his rounds and became one of the 4 players and achieved the best 5-0-0 result since the current tournament format was approved in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated by the 5th and 4th players of the European team with the lowest rating, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who apparently finished his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the overall best European player with 25.5 points earned during his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, really happy, that I got the cup back.
It all depends on the team, I’m glad I could help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He handed the cup to his compatriot John Rampa, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
“I feel incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up following this guy,” Rahm said.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
The strange statistics of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 of the largest titles, which can only be compared to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find a fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed top-notch golf throughout the tournament.
Team captain Jim Furyk said: “I’m proud of these guys, they really fought.
This morning we have really warmed Europe to the heart.
We really didn't make it.
I take off my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will regroup and move forward in cooperation with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee.
I like those 12 guys, I'm glad I could make them captain.
I really have to go.
You have defeated us.”
Red tide update: Concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota districts
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission points to an overall decline in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, spots of blooming water are now reported from the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier – this indicates a decreasing concentration.
The flowering water of the red tide has a range of about 130 miles of coastline from the northern district of Pinellas to the southern district of Lee.
Spots were observed about 10 miles off the coast in Hillsborough County, but last week it was relatively fewer places.
A red tide was also observed in the Pasco district.
In Hillsborough County, low to high concentrations, low to high concentrations, in Manatee County, low to high concentrations, in Sarasota County, low to medium concentrations, and in Charlotte County, low to high concentrations, or in the coastal or high concentrations, have been observed in the high seas.
Respiratory irritations continue to occur in the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
Airway irritation was not reported in northwest Florida last week.
