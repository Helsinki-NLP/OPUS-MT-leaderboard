A rapidly increasing rate of cumulative coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, thereby confirming that despite the different stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly increasing in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to increase the level of preparedness for the influx of COVID-19 patients who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were recorded in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent of the infection is a new type of coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been referred to as coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to available data to date, about 80% of people with COVID-19 have the disease in a mild form, that is, in the form of an infection of the respiratory tract with or without pneumonia, with the majority of patients recovering.
Approximately 14% of COVID-19 cases develop into a more severe form of the disease with the need for hospitalization, and the remaining 6% take a critical form when intensive therapy is required.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
This study analyses trends in cumulative COVID-19 incidence in each European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) country and in the UK and compares them with trends in the Chinese province of Hubei.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the UK with data for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK
After the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and now in the rest of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing according to the same dynamics as in China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Spiteri and his colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that met the criteria by which WHO determines the presence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were registered in France on January 24, 2020, with all three cases returning from Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the UK, with 39,768 infections and 1,727 deaths recorded between 31 December 2019 and that date, of which 17,750 cases, including 1,441 deaths, were in Italy alone.
Determination of cumulative quantity and cumulative incidence of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates daily at 8 a.m. data on the number of registered COVID-19 cases in each country of the world, obtained from official sources such as the ministries of health of these countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data are used to analyse trends in the spread of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with data for Italy.
As an indicator of the level of spread of active COVID-19 cases, the truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 over 14 days was calculated taking into account the usual course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country as of 8:00 a.m. on March 15, 2020, compared to data for Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK
Trends in the truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 over a 14-day period in the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole were consistent with those observed in the Chinese province of Hubei (Figure 1).
The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK as a whole began to rise around 21 February, and on 28 February 2020 there was a sharp jump in this indicator (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK there were similar trends in the increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK compared to a similar figure for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these figures, the total number of cases already reported as of 8 a.m. on 15 March in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the UK is comparable to the number recorded in Italy only about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results indicate a rapid increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is evolving at a comparable rate in all countries.
And this is despite different stages in different countries, differences in the response measures taken by national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for the recognition of cases and different rules for selecting patients for COVID-19 analysis, including “catch-up” testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that about 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions are already as full as possible.
Currently, data on the admission of COVID-19 patients to hospitals and/or intensive care units in the EU/EEA are only available for 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not available).
However, it is necessary to systematically collect such data in order to supplement the current observation data, the subject of which is the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
According to the results of a study conducted in 2010-2011, in Europe there is a significant variation in the number of beds in intensive care units and intensive care units: from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care units and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated ECDC report on the results of the rapid risk assessment for COVID-19 presents scenarios for the simulation of the loading of health system resources with estimated data on the hospitalization of COVID-19 infected in each EU/EEA country and in the UK, when the risk of a lack of available beds in intensive care units exceeds 90%.
As the cases are currently grouped by region of the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of a specific territorial group, information on cases of infection and the number of beds in intensive care units is recommended to be provided, if possible, by units of the 2nd level of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for a long-lasting SARS-CoV-2 contact infection scenario and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive care, which can be observed, for example, in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the ECDC’s latest rapid risk assessment report, prompt, proactive and integrated approaches are essential to contain the spread of SARS-COV-2, followed by a shift from containment to minimization, as, given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases, decision-makers and hospitals may not have the time to respond appropriately.
The rapid risk assessment report also listed public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time within which they can step up their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, in the coming days or weeks, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an influx of patients who will need intensive therapy.
The outbreak of coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been a tragedy for humanity: at the moment, more than 3,000 people have died in China and other countries of the world, and the number of infected has exceeded 80,000.
Similar to the homologous SARS-CoV virus that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and has a lower mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older people more often than younger people, and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid growth in the number of publications about the new disease, this article offers an up-to-date and comprehensive overview of the rapidly developing subject of research.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis of further course and prevention of this disease.
Although many questions have yet to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate the dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival (Chinese New Year), which fell on January 25, 2020 was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese, who, in connection with the outbreak of a new viral infection, were urged to stay at home throughout the holiday and for many weeks after it.
Given the high degree of similarity with the coronavirus (CoV), which caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020 called this virus SARS-CoV-2, and the concomitant disease - coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and quickly spread throughout the country, and then to almost 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been identified, more than 40,000 patients have recovered, and more than 3,000 patients have died.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is “the number one enemy for society” and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 publications on COVID-19 have appeared, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, starting with the first report of January 7, 2020, which identified the sequence of the virus isolated from a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to summarize the results of research in a new and rapidly developing subject area.
To the extent possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and another coronavirus-related disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which erupted in 2012.
We will also discuss the currently known facts about the prevention and prognosis of the course of the disease, as well as some other equally urgent issues.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been among the pathogens that are not deadly to humans and mainly cause about 15% of total respiratory diseases.
However, in this century we have twice encountered highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, that is, the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and the coronavirus of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which caused an outbreak of diseases initially in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronavirus infection in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the report on clusters of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin was first received by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death was registered in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, it became known about the infection of health workers, which made it possible to suggest the possibility of human-to-human transmission of the virus.
On January 23, Wuhan was quarantined, and public transport stopped working.
On January 24, according to the first clinical study of the disease, it was noted that 21 out of 41 patients with confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contact with the seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered the starting point for the spread of the infection from an unknown animal.
On January 30, the WHO announced that the coronavirus outbreak is a global public health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease had spread throughout China and had already spread to about 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final extent and extent of the outbreak has yet to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre clinical trial involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented the following updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infection affected all age groups, but mostly affected people between the ages of 30 and 65.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 of those infected were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher (0.31/100,000) than among women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was spread by clusters mainly in Hubei province and nearby regions.
On average, from the moment of manifestation of symptoms of COVID-19 to the diagnosis took 5 (2–9) days.
The incubation period averaged 4.8 (3.0–7.2) days.
From the moment of manifestation of symptoms to the onset of death, an average of 9.5 (4.8-13) days passed.
The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51–4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23–4.82.
By January 23, 2020, there was an exponential increase in the number of infected, coinciding with large-scale transportation on the eve of the Chinese New Year celebration.
Mortality among patients with a confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10–1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate among patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60) and severe cases of pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large enveloped viruses containing a single strand of semantic RNA.
They can be divided into four species, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and betacoronaviruses are known to affect humans.
In the case of SARS and MERS type coronaviruses, the shell spike glycoprotein (S) binds to the cell receptors of angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP4), respectively, after which membrane synthesis occurs.
In the cytoplasm, the viral RNA genome is released; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, together with enveloped glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, generates virion-containing vesicles, which then merge with the cell membrane, releasing the virus.
The first reports on the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coronavirus whose genome is 99.98% the same as 10 consecutive samples collected in the first outbreak of the disease in the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Using translucent electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultrathin sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
The human enzyme ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein binds to the human ACE2 enzyme less than in the case of SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes the disease in patients of less severity than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate a previously unknown short-lived protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b protein of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in terms of viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, a team of authors led by Zhou presented reports on cryoelectronic tomography of the structure of the full-size human ACE2 enzyme with a resolution of 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> in combination with the B0AT1 amino acid transporter.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed conformations, is assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S-proteins, which serves as evidence for recognizing and infecting the coronavirus.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate owner
It is known that the source of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were bats, from which the virus was transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
By phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was found that the first owners of SARS-CoV-2 are bats, since the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like coronaviruses, namely the coronaviruses of the bats SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZ21.
However, it remains unknown which species became the intermediate host, thanks to which the virus managed to overcome the species barrier and infect humans; the transmission path has also yet to be determined.
Mr. Ji and colleagues suggested that the virus was transmitted from bats to humans by snakes, resulting in homologous recombination in the S-protein.
According to the results of their study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou suggested that pangolins - long-tailed mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99-percent genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 pangolin coronavirus and pangolin.
However, the 1% difference distributed between the two genomes is still very large, so it is believed that the final results with specific evidence have not yet been obtained (Fig. 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
Under laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 40-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It is known that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; effectively block the activity of the virus can ether, 75 percent ethyl alcohol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peruric acid, chloroform and other fat-containing solvents, but not.
The human population as a whole is not immune to SARS-CoV-2, so humans are susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, there are no data on detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, primarily SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
As a rule, the virus that enters the host first recognizes the innate immune system through image-recognition receptors (OCRs), including lectin C-type receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus provokes the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages against viral antigens.
However, thanks to the N-protein, SARS-CoV can avoid an immune reaction.
Soon, an adaptive immune response is involved in the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, play an important role in protecting the body.
CD4+ T cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help protect cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells, causing their programmed death.
Humorous immunity, which includes components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in the fight against viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from the recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the hyperreaction of the immune system entails the local formation of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case scenario lead to multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by cluster manifestation, is more likely to affect older people with concomitant pathologies and pregnant women.
The probability of infection is higher for those people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or have disorders of the immune system.
According to the results of the study of data on the first 425 cases of infection in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mainly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases found that the incubation period averaged 3 days, with a spread ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A later study described above, based on 8,866 cases, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0–7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the timing of quarantine measures, taking into account the most accurate calculations of the duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus to those infected, in whom the disease proceeds asymptomatically.
A common practice is a 14-day quarantine for people who have had contact with the virus or are infected with the virus.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often high fever, which can be the only manifestation or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
In some patients, a week after the onset of the disease, shortness of breath and (or) hypoxia were noted.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with high fever and (or) symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis, even in the absence of pathologies in the chest pictures.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 revealed the following symptom prevalence rates: 98% high fever, 76% dry cough, 55% shortness of breath and 3% diarrhea; 8% of patients required artificial lung ventilation.
Similar results have been obtained from two recent studies of cases of infection in the family and transmission of the virus from asymptomatic infected.
Comparable results were obtained in 2012 in a study of patients with MERS-CoV, whose main symptoms were also fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%).
However, 80% of them required artificial lung ventilation, this figure is much higher than among patients with COVID-19, and it corresponds to a higher mortality rate from MERS than from COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also had diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%).
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high fever (99–100%), dry cough (29–75%), shortness of breath (40–42%), diarrhea (20–25%) and sore throat (13–25%), and artificial lung ventilation is required by 14–20% of patients.
As of February 14, the COVID-19 death rate was 2%, and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
Compared to this figure, the death rate from SARS by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed a mortality rate of 37% out of 2,494 confirmed cases.
According to the results of an earlier study, the baseline reproduction rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) in the range of 5.71–7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was in the range of only 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV by symptom manifestation, mortality rate and R0 is provided in Table 1.1.
The above figures indicate a higher spread capacity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate in case of infection with the new virus is lower compared to the latter two.
Thus, it will be much more difficult to contain the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Clustering often occurs when a person is infected within a family or group of people who have come together for some reason or are on a transport such as a cruise ship.
Patients often traveled to Wuhan or other affected regions, lived there, or had contact with infected or sick people during the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, according to the data presented in the reports, people can be carriers of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and cured patients, after discharge from the hospital, can again become carriers of the virus, and this is an alarming signal for the extension of the quarantine period.
At an early stage, patients have a normal or reduced number of leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 had lymphopenia with white blood cell counts <0x3C> 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L, including white blood cell counts <0x3C> 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, as well as elevated asparagine aminotransferase and viraemia.
Elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin were found in the blood of some patients, and most patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation in the blood.
In patients with severe disease, the level of D-dimer, the breakdown product of fibrin present in the blood, was increased, and the number of lymphocytes was constantly reduced.
In most patients with COVID-19, a chest X-ray examination revealed pathologies characterized by uneven darkening on both sides or darkening in the type of "matte glass" in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage, and acute respiratory disease (ARD).
With the development of ODS, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis lead to a significant disruption of gas exchange.
Dysfunction of pneumocyte types I and II lowers the level of surfactants and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung decline.
Thus, the worst results of X-ray examination often coincide with the most severe cases of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated pneumocyte detachment, hyaline membrane formation and inter-tissue lymphocytic infiltration, and multinucleated syncytial cells in lung patients who died from the disease correspond to the pathology of viral infection and ARS and are similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
The method of detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (PCR with reverse transcriptase) was used as the main criterion in the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, given the high level of false negative results, which can accelerate the pace of the epidemic, since February 13, 2020, China began to make a diagnosis based on clinical manifestations (no longer relying exclusively on reverse transcriptase PCR).
The same was true for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, for effective diagnosis, it is critically important and necessary to combine data from medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and results of radiographic examination.
On February 14, 2020, a team of specialists led by Mr. Feng Zhang described a protocol for the application of the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique for the detection of SARS-CoV-2; this technique allows the detection of synthetic RNA fragments without SARS-CoV-2 at a density of 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10–18 mol/l at a rate of up to 200 mol/l.
This new technique, if successfully tested on clinical drugs, can significantly increase the sensitivity of tests and the convenience of their conduct.
Because of the lack of experience in dealing with the previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can generally only provide COVID-19 patients with supportive therapy while trying to apply any therapeutic methods that have been used or proposed in the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (table (Table 2).2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and the provision of psychological support.
For treatment, it was proposed to use even the plasma of recovered patients.
Pharmaceutical companies are rushing to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
In the initial stages, SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly the lungs, and may also affect other organs expressing ACE2 to a lesser extent, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
However, disruption of work and failure of the respiratory organs are the main threat and cause of death of patients.
Thus, to relieve symptoms and save lives, it is critical to maintain respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen supply, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, which are prescribed depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified extrapulmonary circulation technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, it is essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2 to maintain a water-salt balance, prevent and treat secondary infections and septic shock, and protect vital organ functions.
Cytokine storm is known to be a consequence of hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.
A cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory process that develops in response to the release of a series of cytokines, including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines provoke immune cells to release a huge amount of free radicals, which become the main cause of the development of ARI and organ failure.
In the treatment of cytokine storm, especially in patients in severe condition, the suppression of immunity is of paramount importance.
For the treatment of cytokine storm used corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monoclonal antibodies that serve as an inhibitor of interleukin-6.
Other methods of treating a cytokine storm based on immunosuppression include modulation of the immune response aimed at controlling T-cells; blockade of the production of cytokines IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF; suppression of the yanus kinase; use of blinatumomab, cytokine signal suppressors 4 and innF.
To reduce the severity of the consequences of inflammatory processes in the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants.
However, steroids in large doses are not useful in the treatment of severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly worsen the prognosis.
However, short courses of corticosteroids at low and medium dosages are recommended for use with caution in the treatment of COVID-19 patients in critical condition.
At the time of writing, there is no proven effective antiviral therapy.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, proved to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola viruses and the Marburg virus.
Later, remdesivir also demonstrated the ability to suppress other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Relying on these data, Gilead has provided this drug formulation to China for paired studies in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are eagerly awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, <0xCE><0xB1>-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been proposed as possible treatment options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combination treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects.
Care should be taken to monitor the interaction of these drugs with other drugs prescribed to patients.
Plasma of recovered patients and production of antibodies
Blood sampling in patients who have recovered from an infectious disease has been used for a very long time to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect a healthy population.
Indeed, the blood of recovered patients often contains a relatively high amount of antibodies to fight the pathogen.
Antibodies are found in immunoglobulin produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual pathogen molecules and target them to neutralize them.
Based on this premise, plasma was isolated from blood samples from a group of patients cured of COVID-19, which was then administered to 10 seriously ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, the severity of inflammation and viral load decreased, and blood oxygen saturation increased.
However, in order to suggest the mass use of this method before carrying out specific therapy, it is necessary not yet carried out verification and not compiled explanations.
In addition, taking into account the therapeutic effect, some disadvantages associated with the use of plasma should be carefully studied.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune system and cause cytokine release syndrome, which, given toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma for the treatment of patients in critical condition requires a lot.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight the global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and practical to isolate the B cells of recovered patients and determine the genetic code of the effective antibodies or to conduct screening to find effective antibodies against critical virus proteins.
So we can immediately move to mass production of antibodies.
The Chinese have used traditional medicine for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness largely depends on the combination of many components of the formula, the composition of which differs depending on the diagnosis of the disease, based on the theories of Chinese traditional medicine.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or have an uncertain effect, since it is difficult to isolate and test these components or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective specific COVID-19 therapy, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative methods of treating patients with mild to moderate severity of symptoms or for patients recovering from a severe stage of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest proportion of recovered patients with COVID-19 was observed in a number of provinces of China where Chinese traditional medicine was used in the treatment of 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while in Hubei province where Chinese traditional medicine was most used for the treatment of only about 30% of patients with COVID-19.
However, this is a rather rough comparison, since the assessment should be carried out taking into account many other factors of influence, such as the number of patients and the severity of their disease.
On February 18, 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang and his colleagues published the results of a study that compared treatment exclusively with Western medicine and combined treatment with Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the timing of normalization of body temperature, elimination of symptoms and the provision of medical care in a hospital were significantly less in patients who were treated with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in patients who were treated only by Western methods.
The most surprising is the fact that the proportion of patients who began to worsen symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the group that was treated by combining Western and Chinese traditional medicine methods than in the group that was treated only by Western methods (7.4% compared to 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second group.
However, the efficacy and safety of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more carefully controlled studies conducted on a larger scale and in more regions.
It is also of particular interest to obtain, as far as possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of the aspects of the effectiveness of the components used in Chinese traditional medicine techniques or their combination.
Patients who are suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 mostly experience a strong fear of an acute and even fatal illness, and quarantined people also experience boredom, loneliness, and extreme irritation.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric illnesses have been reported, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal behavior.
Mandatory monitoring of contacts and quarantines, among the measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and guilt associated with the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric assistance should be provided to patients with COVID-19, persons under suspicion and contacting them, as well as to all other people who need it.
Within the framework of psychological support, multidisciplinary psychiatric care teams should be formed, clear information should be established with regular and accurate updating of information about the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and professional electronic devices and applications should be used to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in interrupting the chain of transmission from infectious animals and infected people to susceptible hosts and are often used in addition to antiviral therapy used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
Work has been carried out to develop vaccines based on S-protein, the purpose of which is to produce long-lived and highly active neutralizing antibodies and (or) protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
In animal studies, live attenuated vaccines against SARS viruses have been developed.
However, before the start of clinical trials, it is still necessary to determine the effectiveness of these possible vaccines in natural conditions when they are used in adult patients, the model of infection with lethal doses and the degree of protection against infection with zoonotic viruses.
Perhaps the reason is that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and no new cases have been reported since.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of disease caused by the MERS virus, originating in the Middle East and spreading to other regions due to the conservation of zoonotic sources in endemic habitats, continue to emerge.
To combat MERS, vaccination strategies have been developed using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein elements, and some of these strategies have been evaluated in animals.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for people without immunity is an urgent and critical challenge that needs to be addressed to contain a raging epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long duration (an average of 18 months) required to develop the vaccine and the dynamic modification of coronaviruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show a complete picture of the clinical course of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with a high incidence of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
In this regard, it is critical for health authorities to develop a prognostic model of the disease in order to prioritize their actions, especially in areas where resources are scarce.
Based on the clinical trial data presented to date, the following factors may influence or be associated with disease prediction in COVID-19 patients (table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the course of the disease caused by the SARS virus, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients aged 30 to 65 years, 47.7% of whom are over 50 years old, according to the above-mentioned study of 8,866 cases.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying conditions and complications, and were significantly older than those who did not require such care (average age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a predictive factor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher than among women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
morbidity and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to develop acute myocardial damage and arrhythmias.
Cardiac events were also a major cause of death in patients with SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been reported to bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can cause liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases are closely interrelated and can distort the results.
Deviations detected in laboratory studies: the level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage, and it is proposed to be considered as a potential prognostic factor in the course of the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
It was also proposed to take into account the relationship between the level of C-reactive protein, the severity of the disease and the prognosis for COVID-19.
In addition, an increased level of lactate dehydrogenase, asparagine aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and creatine kinase can also predict the result.
These enzymes are secreted in large quantities by various organs, especially the heart and liver, and their release occurs when tissues are damaged.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
The main clinical symptoms: to predict the results and complications in the treatment of COVID-19, along with other factors, the data of chest X-ray examination and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be taken into account.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immune suppressors widely used in infectious diseases as adjunctive therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Because corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe forms of SARS, many of the survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis, which led to lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Thus, if necessary, the use of steroids for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, these drugs should be prescribed in small dosages and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, against the backdrop of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unforeseen severe stress, as they often have to endure long periods of quarantine, cope with a high degree of uncertainty, and watch the deaths of their relatives and other patients.
To relieve stress in such patients and help them return to normal life, they must necessarily be consulted psychologically and provide long-term support.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, the COVID-19 epidemic seems to be different in its signs from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses that cause common colds, can successfully multiply in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms at all at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, those patients who have an early stage of the disease or have not yet completed the incubation period can, leading their normal lives, spread the virus on a significant scale, which significantly complicates epidemiological control.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was thought to occur when patients were severely ill, although in most cases early infection did not occur.
Thus, today’s COVID-19 epidemic is much more severe than the SARS epidemic and more difficult to control.
Currently, China is doing a lot of work, which announced a universal quarantine in Wuhan and neighboring cities, as well as extended the quarantine regime for almost the entire population, introduced in order to break the chain of spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Although these measures are causing huge damage to the economy and other spheres of life of the country, the number of detected new patients is decreasing, which indicates a slowdown in the rate of spread of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic estimates, the outbreak of the disease will end by March, and the phase of fading will last 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter and colleagues calculated that the COVID-19 outbreak, which looks much more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from the group, led by Ira Longini, compiled a model to predict the end of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could affect two-thirds of the world's population.
A team of Canadian specialists reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in nasal and throat swabs taken from patients recovered and discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to the flu.
However, the reduction in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that current strategies may have had an effect.
According to initial forecasts, Ebola was supposed to affect up to a million people and cause the death of half a million patients.
But due to strict quarantine and isolation, the disease eventually managed to get under control.
It is likely that, like SARS-CoV, the infective capacity of SARS-CoV-2 may weaken, and over time it will disappear or turn into a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
The following is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (Fig. 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through coughing or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with virus-contaminated materials.
The virus has also been detected in feces, which means that an oral-fecal route of transmission is also possible.
According to one recent study, 41% of the 138 cases studied may have been due to infection in a hospital, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 medical staff.
Serious precautions should therefore be taken to protect the public, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even outsiders in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is wearing face masks; both surgical masks and N95 class respirators (series number 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks do not allow the microdrops of fluid from the potentially infected to disperse in the air and settle on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95-class masks (series No. 1860s) can protect against the inhalation of virions ranging from 10 to 80 nm in size, they pass only 5% of virions; SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same size as SARS-CoV, and they are both approximately 85 nm in size.
Because the particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks folded together, healthcare professionals in direct contact with patients must wear N95 masks (series number 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical professionals should wear a figure-fitting protective gown to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also enter the body through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, the doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95-class mask; it is possible the virus entered his body through inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare professionals should also wear transparent face shields or closed-type protective goggles.
The entire population in affected or potentially threatened regions is urged to wash their hands more often than usual with disinfectants, to try not to leave the house, observing self-isolation, and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
Acceptable distance to the patient is the distance of about a meter.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not previously known to mankind, its high degree of similarity to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have been an alarming signal for China, taking into account the experience it acquired during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, only after January 19, 2020, the Director of the Center for Disease Control in Wuhan calmed the citizens, saying that the new virus has low contagiousness and limited reproductive capacity in human-to-human transmission and that the prevention and control of the disease will not be a problem.
This statement greatly reduced social tensions, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Chinese New Year celebration, and a critical time was missed when the disease could be contained within Wuhan with minimal losses.
China’s health authorities can learn this hard lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, public health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements as each word is taken into account by citizens and can affect their attitudes and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more closely to unusual information coming from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more vigorous measures to deter potential epidemics and public awareness at early stages of its development; and (4) carry out more effective public awareness and awareness-raising measures at early stages of its development.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the previously unexplored SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease has spread throughout China and, at the time of writing, has spread to 50 countries around the world.
Because the virus is very similar to the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a relapse of SARS occurred during the COVID-19 outbreak.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, significant in terms of containing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people to a greater extent than young people and men to a greater extent than women; the proportion of severe cases and mortality rates among older people are also higher than among young people.
The SARS mortality rate is higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even in the asymptomatic course of the disease, while patients with SARS usually infect others only in severe cases of the disease, so it is more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading much faster and on a larger scale than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative conventional tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
On the other hand, cured patients can again show positive tests for the virus.
This greatly increases the risk of spreading the virus.
Against the background of such a rapid advancement of COVID-19 research, some important issues remain unresolved, namely:
What is the origin of SARS-CoV-2?
Despite the detection of a 96 percent homolog between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat coronaviruses, we still cannot claim that SARS-CoV-2 infection originated from bats.
What animal became an intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot reliably interrupt the transmission path, and the epidemiological situation can worsen at any time.
Molecular simulations and biochemical samples have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus enter the cells of the respiratory tract and provoke subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-producing cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot provide a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does a virus genetically evolve in the process of human-to-human transmission?
Will it cause a global pandemic, will it disappear like SARS, or will it periodically recur like the flu?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.
Zoonotic origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their carriers, including humans, for millennia.
Before 2003, it was known that two human coronaviruses (HCoV) cause a mild illness, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have changed our understanding of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 again attracted attention to coronaviruses and surprised us with the high transmission but less pronounced pathogenicity of this virus compared to the related SARS-CoV virus.
A human coronavirus infection is zoonotic, and understanding its zoonotic origin will be very useful.
Most human coronaviruses come from bats, for which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoirs of some human coronaviruses are also known.
The definition of carrier animals directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
Studying the interaction of animals that are carriers of coronaviruses may also shed light on the pathogenesis of coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we provide the available data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their detection, as well as their zoonotic origin and methods of interspecies transmission.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, the current epidemic of the disease caused by the coronavirus detected in 2019 (COVID-19) is also considered.
In addition, the conditions necessary for a successful change of carriers and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are noted.
Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, which is a group of shell viruses with one positive-polar strand of RNA.
These viruses, with the largest genome among RNA-containing viruses, containing from 26 to 32 thousand nucleotides, got their name due to their form, which, when viewed under an electron microscope, resembles a crown.
In terms of structure, coronaviruses contain unsegmented genomes with identical organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open partially overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the PP1A and PP1AB replication polyproteins.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins, designated nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome contains open reading frames for structured proteins, including the spike protein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
In other lines of coronaviruses, a number of line-specific accessory proteins are also encoded.
Based on the differences in protein sequences, coronaviruses are divided into four types (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-coronaviruses), with the beta-coronavirus species comprising the majority of human coronaviruses and divided into four lines (A, B, C, and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that bats and rodents are the genetic source of most alpha- and beta-coronaviruses, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma- and delta-coronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly overcome interspecies barriers, and some of them have evolved into pathogens that are dangerous to humans.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
These include the human alpha-coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The other five beta-coronaviruses include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
Human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 are extremely pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in a relatively larger number of patients with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory disease (ARD) and exhibiting extrapulmonary symptoms.
The first strand of the human coronavirus HCoV-229E, B814, was obtained from a sample separated from the nasopharynx of patients who contracted a cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has accumulated more detailed knowledge about the HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses that cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, prior to the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that human coronavirus infection was considered generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in current history; more than 8,000 people were affected and the overall mortality rate was approximately 10%.
Ten years later, an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a prolonged epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease spreading sporadically to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current coronavirus infection epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which as of March 3, 2020, has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people.
Alarm bells are ringing and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses are zoonotic in origin, and their sources are bats, mice or domestic animals.
Numerous data sets testify to the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronaviruses from bats, to whose organisms the viruses have adapted well and in which they do not show pathogenic properties, but demonstrate a wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed a severe challenge to China and the world from a medical, scientific, social and moral point of view.
The study of the zoonotic mechanism of origin of human coronaviruses will allow to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution and the factors limiting interspecific transfer.
It may also prompt or accelerate the search for a reservoir, an intermediate and amplification carrier of SARS-CoV-2, which is very important to prevent the disease from spreading again in the future.
This review provides general information on zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we designate and consider the following general feature: the initial viruses from which human coronaviruses originated are usually not pathogenic to their reservoir carriers, but acquire a pathogenic character after interspecific transfer to a new carrier.
We also analyze the evolution trend of human coronaviruses, according to which an increase in transmission is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogenic properties.
In the same context, the result of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also considered.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of HCoV-229E was first derived from a sample separated from the nasopharynx of patients with a cold, various coronaviruses were found in various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human coronaviruses have been identified in recent decades.
Table 1 provides a brief history of the detection of human coronaviruses in chronological order.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was derived from samples taken from the airways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966; this virus subsequently adapted to reproduction in the lines of WI-38 lung cells.
Patients infected with the HCoV-229E virus showed cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, general malaise, and sore throat, with fever and coughing occurring in 10-20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage into the brains of mammalian mice.
The clinical signs of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are indistinguishable from those of other respiratory tract pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both the HCoV-229E virus and the HCoV-OC43 virus are ubiquitous in the world and are generally transmitted in the winter in temperate latitudes.
Basically, the incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by about a two-week illness.
According to the results of a study in volunteers, healthy people infected with the HCoV-229E virus developed a common cold of mild form.
Only a few patients with weakened immunity showed a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the “atypical pneumonia epidemic,” was the first well-documented human coronavirus pandemic in history, and the causative agent of the disease was the SARS-CoV virus, the third of the identified human coronaviruses.
The first case of SARS was identified in late 2002 in the Chinese province of Guangdong.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease has spread to many countries and continents.
Excluding overactive vectors, it has been estimated that each patient can infect approximately two more people; the incubation period was 4 to 7 days, and the peak of viral load was on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially developed muscle pain, headaches, fever, general malaise and chills, and later symptoms included shortness of breath, coughing and respiratory failure.
Common laboratory abnormalities from the norm in SARS are lymphopenia, violations in liver samples and increased creatine kinase levels.
Patients with SARS also have diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophage levels.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently need intensive therapy and mechanical ventilation of the lungs.
In such severe cases, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, can also be infected, which is usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can be fatal, especially for patients with weakened immunity.
For the first time, the virus was isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of the patient who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, huge efforts have been made to research human coronaviruses.
In late 2004, HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
At first, it was found that it mainly affects young children, the elderly and patients with weakened immunity and respiratory diseases.
For the disease caused by HCoV-NL63, such manifestations as runny nose, conjunctivitis, high fever and bronchiolitis are characteristic.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from nasal material taken from an 8-month-old boy from the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
The virus was discovered in the Netherlands, but in fact it is widespread.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to be responsible for approximately 4.7% of widespread respiratory diseases, with peaks occurring in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 has been linked to obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to out-of-hospital pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is associated with an exacerbation of asthmatic diseases.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, the HCoV-HKU1 virus that causes mild respiratory disease has been detected worldwide.
All four of the human coronaviruses causing out-of-hospital infections have adapted well to humans, and their mutation involving highly pathogenic diseases is generally unlikely, although incidents have been and their causes are unknown, as in a rare example with the more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which, according to recent reports, caused severe infections.
Usually, by acquiring the ability to be effectively transmitted and stored in the human body, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic.
The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) coronavirus was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
The majority of laboratory-confirmed cases occurred in the Middle East, but imported cases and spread through episodic secondary cases in close contact have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical manifestations of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) resemble the symptoms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) – both infections are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed acute renal failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by human-transmitted coronaviruses.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, there were more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome with a high mortality rate (34.4%), so MERS-CoV is considered one of the most deadly viruses known to man.
In the period from mid to late December 2019, clusters of patients with pneumonia were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China, which is now, looking back, associated with infection caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization has announced that the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global public health emergency, and the disease itself has been dubbed “coronavirus infection 19” (COVID-19).
As of 3 March 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a mortality rate of approximately 3.4%.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in the Chinese province of Hubei is 4.2%, and outside of it - 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS and MERS coronaviruses, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly go into acute respiratory failure syndrome.
Despite the similarity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses nevertheless form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but has a higher transmission capacity compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have been registered, which indicates the ability of this virus to spread rapidly throughout the world.
The comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses reveals important similarities and differences.
First, human-transmitted coronaviruses have a similar incubation period and duration of the diseases caused by them.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 shows the same trend as the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are similar to what is most often observed when infected with human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections, including non-specific manifestations, mild symptoms, or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subgroup of severe COVID-19 cases can be distinguished, although the ratio here is slightly lower.
Thirdly, in terms of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, there are also interesting patterns characteristic of both human coronaviruses causing out-of-hospital infections and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses causing out-of-hospital infections.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases with each subsequent virus transfer (i.e., infection of each subsequent person), as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in stool samples.
We have yet to answer the question of whether the fecal-oral route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least in some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
Of particular interest is the question of the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, characteristic of human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections.
However, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the features of SARS-CoV-2, including transmissibility, pathogenicity, and sustained spread after human transmission.
All four human coronaviruses causing out-of-hospital infections with mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
On the other hand, it may be people who have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both of them could be called the only survivors of human coronavirus pandemics in the past.
Human coronaviruses that cause severe disease in humans, and people who have human coronaviruses that cause severe disease, simply did not survive.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate in the human body sufficiently to accumulate adaptive mutations that counteract the factors limiting the carrier.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the chance that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission among humans will be difficult to stop with the help of quarantine or other infectious disease control measures.
For many years, four out-of-hospital coronaviruses have been circulating among the population, causing the common cold in people with healthy immune systems.
These viruses do not require a tank animal.
The highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans well enough, and their transmission among humans cannot be maintained.
They need to persist and reproduce in their zoonotic reservoirs and look for a case of hitting susceptible human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate or amplifying carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four out-of-hospital HCoV viruses.
It is very easily transmitted as out-of-hospital HCoV, at least at present.
But it is more pathogenic than out-of-hospital HCoV, and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it adapts completely to humans and whether it will circulate in a human environment without a tank or with an intermediate carrier animal.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, intermediate, amplifying, and reservoir carriers of HCoV viruses.
The animal serves as an evolutionary carrier of HCoV if it carries a closely related ancestor with the same high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
Ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this carrier.
Similarly, the carrier-reservoir constantly carries HCoV over a long period of time.
In both cases, carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV was only introduced into an intermediate medium just before or around the time it was introduced to humans, it was not well adapted to the new medium and often pathogenic.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of an amplifying carrier, allowing the virus to replicate lightning-fast and then passing it on to humans, increasing the scale of human infection.
HCoV can carry a stalemate infection if it cannot withstand transmission inside the intermediate carrier.
In contrast, HCoV viruses can also adapt to intermediate carriers and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural reservoir carrier.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the zero SARS patient had a history of contact with game animals.
Further seroprevalence studies have shown that in animal traffickers, the prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV virus is higher compared to the general population.
The Himalayan civet (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dog in the live animal markets were the first established carriers of viruses similar to and almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that after the destruction of all civets in the markets, SARS cases were no longer reported.
At the same time, it was reported that Himalayan civets living in nature or on farms that did not enter the markets in most cases were not identified, which leads to the conclusion that Himalayan civets could only serve as an intermediate amplifying carrier, and not a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the different animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it cannot be ruled out that numerous species of small mammals can also serve as intermediate enhancers.
They all seem to be dead-end carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.
A subsequent search for a natural SARS-CoV-carrier animal revealed a closely related CoV of bats, which was called the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 coronavirus associated with atypical pneumonia, and which is present in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These mice tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bat coronaviruses have 88-92% of the same nucleotide sequence homology as SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the groundwork for a new concept that bats have become carriers of new human pathogens.
Bats have also been found to have several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs), but none of them except one, which stands for WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
The SARS-CoV receptor is known to be the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
WIV1, derived from the faeces of bats, has been shown to use ACE2 bats, civets and humans as a receptor to enter the cell.
Curiously, serum from recovering SARS patients could neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the homology of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent SARS-CoV virus, and bats are not a direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis places MERS-CoV in the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, dipeptyldipeptidease-4 (DPP4), to penetrate viruses.
The sequences of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the MERS-CoV virus are phylogenetically closer to the sequences from bat beta-coronaviruses detected in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV virus has been found in wild bats.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 of bats coincides only by 87%.
That is, bats may not have been a direct reservoir carrier of the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-breasted camels are seropositive to MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, as are camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
Live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, has been isolated from the nasal swabs of single-tailed camels, further confirming the camels’ role as true reservoir carriers of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV had minor symptoms, but massive viral excretion.
It is noteworthy that infected camels secreted the virus not only by respiratory, but also by fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus excretion in bats.
However, there are still questions as many confirmed cases of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome have not had a history of camel contact prior to the onset of symptoms and are plausibly attributed to human-to-human transmission or transmission through unknown channels involving unidentified animal species that are carriers of MERS-CoV.
The homology of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotides by 96.2% coincides with the CoV RaTG13 of bats isolated from the Asian horseshoe bat Rhinolophus affinis.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the divergence of the sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to be attributed to parental relationships.
That is, bats may not be a direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV-2, unless, in the future, almost identical bat coronaviruses are found.
Presumably, the immediate animals carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Wuhan wholesale seafood market, with which many initial cases of COVID-19 have been associated, indicating a likely case of animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have concluded that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also carry the parent betacoronavirus, a related strain of SARS-CoV-2.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences of these new genomes of the pangolin coronavirus is 85-92% the same as SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with identity at the nucleotide sequence level being about 90%.
They cluster into two differentiating subgenres of viruses like SARS-CoV-2 in a phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-binding domain (RSD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
On the contrary, RSD strains of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology throughout the genome.
An earlier study of patients with pangolin also reported the determination of viral contigues in lung samples that were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
In this study, other methods of assembly and manual processing were used to produce a genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full-size viral genome.
It cannot be ruled out that pangolin has become one of the intermediate carriers of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and the pangolin beta-coronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has not yet been established.
While the highest sequence homology was found in RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest sequence homology across the genome.
Very theoretically, a high degree of similarity between pangolin beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is associated with parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal favours recombination between the pangolin beta-coronavirus, a relative of SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As the driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-coronaviruses.
There is still no definitive decision on the direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV viruses, the zoonotic origin of the HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses is also being studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be derived from bat coronaviruses, while the parent viruses of the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 strains have been detected in rodents.
The bat coronavirus, named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and identified in the North American tricolor mammal, has been reported to show close affinity for HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically linked to another bat coronavirus called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that camels might have been its intermediate carrier.
For clarity, current knowledge about the animal origin of known coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis provided evidence of HCoV interspecies transmission events in the anamnesis.
When HCoV-OC43 interspecific transmission occurred around 1890 and people became infected from pets, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not so clear.
Alpha-coronaviruses of bats, closely related to HCoV-229E, have been detected.
Between them is the alpha-coronavirus alpaca.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it was humans, not alpacas, who could have come into contact with bats in a common ecological niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with alpacas.
Second, bat alphacoronaviruses, related to HCoV-229E, are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alphacoronavirus caused an attack of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alphacoronavirus was not detected in wild animals.
Thus, it cannot be ruled out that alpacas have received an alphacoronavirus, a related HCoV-229E, from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of pathogenic human viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats could directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while bat alphacoronaviruses could serve as a gene pool for the HCoV-229E virus, alpacas and unicorn camels could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of the MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to single-tailed camels and from single-tailed camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known by its initial identification and has subsequently been confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is obvious that bats give a rich pool of virus species for interspecies exchange of gene fragments and interspecies transmission.
Long life spans, densely populated colonies, close social interaction, and the ability to fly make bats the “ideal proliferators.”
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to one-armed camels decades ago.
He adapted well to these camels, which from an intermediate carrier turned into a stable and natural reservoir carrier.
In these animals, the MERS-CoV virus causes a very mild disease and is characterized by a relatively low frequency of mutations.
Its episodic transmission to humans is accidental, and the human remains a dead-end carrier of MERS-CoV, as its transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-coronaviruses are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They can be dead-end carriers of beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, it is necessary to confirm or exclude several possibilities of interspecies transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from animals to humans.
First, bats can be a reservoir carrier for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share an ecological niche with bats by mining or cutting the carcasses of these animals.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate boosters into which a related SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently entered.
People are infected with the virus through cutting carcasses and eating the meat of wild animals.
It is possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Examination of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is justified.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that came into contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to different types of animal carriers, three major factors from viruses also contributed to the intersection of interspecific barriers.
First of all, their relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered "moderately high" with an average frequency of replacements of approximately 10–4 per year at one site 2, depending on the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to new hosts.
Coronaviruses have corrective exoribonuclease, the removal of which leads to an extremely high frequency of mutation and attenuation or even nonviability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue of Remdesivir inhibits the replication of coronaviruses by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the frequency of mutations of coronaviruses is almost a million times higher than their carriers.
In addition, the mutation rate can often be even higher if the coronaviruses are not well adapted to the carrier.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 mutations is apparently lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, this virus has already adapted to another carrier close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to monocot camels.
It is theoretically unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antivirals will rapidly lose effectiveness as a result of genetic drift.
Second, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses leads to greater plasticity in genomic modification with respect to mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecific coevolution favorable for the emergence of new coronaviruses under appropriate conditions.
This is facilitated by numerous unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded in the direction of the 3<0xE2><0x80><0xB2> end of the genome.
Thirdly, thanks to the unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses randomly and often switch matrices during RNA replication.
During the transcription of the DNA of the coronavirus in the carrier, which serves as a mixing vessel, the threads are often switched.
High homologous full-size and subgenomic RNAs can recombine and create new coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, and in animal coronaviruses such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 in bats.
Virus-carrier interaction with respect to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, another key factor important for interspecies transmission is the interaction of the virus with the carrier receptor.
In this article, SARS-CoV recombination is presented as a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis between human and civet SARS-CoV strains, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different carriers, especially with regard to mutations on the RSD protein S.
In general, the RSD protein S of the coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor, and the antibody response of the carrier intensively selects it.
RSD in SARS-CoV is an amino acid, from 318th to 510th, on the S1 fragment, which binds to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (APF2) and its co-receptors to introduce the virus into the cell.
The SARS-CoV RSD is capable of recognizing the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, civets, mice, and raccoons, making interspecies transmission of the virus possible.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found in RSD, which differ from human and civet viral strains, 4 of which are in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV civet has K479N and S487T mutations in RSD, which may increase the affinity of spike protein interaction with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be particularly important for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 segment of protein S leads to the fact that the binding affinity of protein S to human ACE2 may have changed.
Indeed, research using a cryoelectronic microscope says that the affinity of this connection is 10-20 times higher than between human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV virus protein S.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other co-receptors are required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but to another segment of protein S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidease N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylsialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after interspecies transmission from carrier animals.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of HCoV is also controlled by other factors of dependence and restriction of the carrier.
The divergence of these carrier proteins between humans and natural reservoir carriers of HCoVs, such as bats, monocots, and rodents, may represent a barrier to interspecies transmission.
For successful interspecies transmission of HCoV viruses, it is necessary to usurp the factors of dependence and subordinate the factors of restriction of carriers.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between virus and carrier still need to be defined and categorised.
Good results can be achieved by impartial full-genome screening of the dependence and restriction factors of carriers for SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology.
Emergence of new HCoVs: back to zero
The variety of bat coronaviruses creates ample opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses serve as a genetic pool for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also the driving force behind the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to radically modify virus phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is considered important for adaptation to humans, as bat viruses related to SARS-CoV have been isolated, but have been found to encode ORF8 divergent proteins.
In strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoV coronaviruses was detected.
This deletion breaks up ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates carrier change.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha- and gamma-coronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination localisations have also been identified in non-structural nsp9 proteins, most nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it was shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV was subjected to recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in single-masted camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCoVs in which HCoVs were recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It is also necessary to warn that artificial selection can contribute to unintentional changes in viral genomes, which is most likely due to the release of the virus from the selection pressures exerted, for example, by the carrier's immune system.
An example of such effects is the loss of full-size ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E due to binucleotide deletion.
While the intact open-frame reading of ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpaca alphacoronavirus exhibits a single-nucleotide insertion, leading to a shift in the frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoVs is also driven by the selection pressure on their reservoir carriers.
In case of infection of bats with coronaviruses, weak symptoms or their absence were registered, which indicates mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
It turned out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, defects in activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in bats is suppressed by the apregulation of the inhibitory receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of molecules of the main histocompatibility complex of class I.
Moreover, the high level of active oxygen, which is provided by the high metabolic activity of bats, can suppress the replication of the coronavirus, while affecting the reading of exoribonucleases, thus creating a selection pressure for the generation of strains of the virus, which, when penetrated into a new carrier, are highly pathogenic.
More pathogenic strains of coronavirus can also evolve due to recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties for carrier adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that over the past twenty years, three new human coronaviruses have appeared.
Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir carriers, such as bats or camels.
They replicate confidently without causing a strong immune response in the carrier.
This is the secret of why we see asymptomatic carriers, and what causes severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are associated mainly with hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more serious the lung damage.
On the contrary, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is not associated with the replication of the coronavirus.
The same non-binding immune response strategy may have beneficial effects in therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
Bats have a particularly strong interferon response.
Thus, taking interferon type I at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should have a beneficial effect.
In addition, in bats, the activation of the NLRP3-inflammasome is impaired.
Based on this, the inhibition of NLRP3-inflammasome by MCC950 may prove useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general scheme by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV arose.
While bat beta-coronavirus was found, the nucleotide homology of which is 95% SARS-CoV, there is also bat coronavirus, the nucleotide homology of which is 96% SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other animals in the markets have been found to carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no direct intermediate carriers have been established for SARS-CoV-2.
Pangolin beta-coronaviruses, strikingly homologous SARS-CoV-2, have been found, suggesting that pangolins may have served as one of the intermediate carriers or that fragments of genes from pangolin beta-coronaviruses may have entered the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by humans.
Coronaviruses have attracted widespread attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoirs of HCoV in human transmission.
Convincing evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are derived from bats and have been transmitted to humans via intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and civets in the markets, closing the game markets and destroying the civets on them could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in light of the discovery of a variety of lineages of pangolin beta-coronaviruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed from food markets to prevent zoonotic transmission.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans via pangolins and other mammals and how this may occur remains a challenge in future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has existed for a long time in one-armed camels.
These camels serve as an important means of transport, as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in China’s wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop periodic outbreaks of MERS, an integrated approach should be taken to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infectious control measures.
Because we can’t eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may appear that cause disease outbreaks.
Various zoonotic coronaviruses are circulating in the world.
In particular, the coronaviruses of bats with zoonotic potential are extremely diverse.
There are a huge number of possibilities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonotic coronaviruses, which in the future will lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are easier to transmit and (or) more deadly to humans.
In order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals in some areas of China should be abandoned.
After the severe tests that have become SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and a plan to respond to such situations is needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until there is a possibility of seizing new territories.
Although many properties of bats are favorable for the spread of viruses, if you teach people to stay away from them, you can minimize the likelihood of human contact with bats and other species of wild animals.
To better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural carriers, ongoing epidemiological surveillance of mammals is needed, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of coronaviruses from animals to humans and future outbreaks of disease.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from the ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
The zoonotic puzzle of SARS-CoV-2 still lacks some fragments.
First, if bats transmitted the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, then it is necessary to determine how people came into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if the role of the true intermediate carrier is played by a third mammal, then it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its precursor viruses will be identified in their natural carriers.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Diagnostic criteria for “suspicion cases” and “confirmed cases” of COVID-19 need to be updated
On February 6, 2020, our group published a brief guide to the diagnosis and treatment of a new coronavirus infection in 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information about our experience and provides verified recommendations to combat this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have increased gradually based on current research findings and clinical experience; thus, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment regarding our recommendations and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for “suspicious cases” and “confirmed cases” in accordance with the “Recommendations for Diagnosis and Therapy for COVID-19” (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, there was an outbreak of the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially named coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the viral disease itself was called “severe acute respiratory syndrome 2” (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a brief guidebook and published it online on the website of Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This publication has attracted a lot of attention.
COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has been gradually increased based on current research findings and clinical experience; thus, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
For example, between 16 January and 3 March 2020, seven issues of the Recommendations on Diagnosis and Therapy for COVID-19, published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), have been published, with some of its provisions changing significantly.
Recently, a paper prepared by Zhou with co-authors commented on our recommendations. They contained simple diagnostic suggestions based on existing clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations and provided valuable background information on this worldwide pandemic.
We reaffirm the high importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest edition of the “Recommendations on Diagnosis and Therapy for COVID-19” (trial version 7) and the results of ongoing research, and their work needs to be updated.
According to the seventh edition of this document (as of March 3, 2020), in order to conduct a comprehensive analysis when confirming a suspected case of the disease, it is necessary to combine any one element of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of the disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and its environs or in other localities where there have been reported cases of COVID-19 within 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test based on nucleic acids); (3) history of contact with patients with high fever
Clinical manifestations: (1) high fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) the presence of external manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of leukocytes is normal or reduced with a reduced number of lymphocytes at an early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis for a confirmed case of the disease should be based on the case of suspected disease with one of the following points of pathogenetic or serological evidence, namely: (1) real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) full-genomic virus sequencing shows high homogeneity relative to novel coronaviruses; (3) positive test results for serovirus I.
It can also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions of this document, a real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples was added.
Pathogenetic diagnosis of the blood sample was added in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) editions; and then in the seventh edition the need for serological evidence was added.
These changes are based on ongoing work by researchers looking for the optimal kit to detect nucleic acids in rapid diagnosis, as well as to analyze samples taken from the airways, including blood sampling, which increases the availability of different samples and contributes to the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the disease confirmation criteria.
However, there is growing evidence that caution should be exercised in treating patients with atypical symptoms and patients without pronounced symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented in Zhou et al. should be updated, as it classifies individuals without clinical symptoms as a “low-risk” group.
The evaluation system also needs to be refined in further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we hope to receive more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments.
When it comes to diagnosing “suspicious cases” and “confirmed cases,” we encourage readers to follow and strictly follow the latest recommendations that are given in the countries where they live.
Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner with a view to providing effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 – daily maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 per day.
This is the highest number of deaths from the virus per day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that among the reported cases of infection included 114 current cases, as well as 33 recovered patients who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online briefing, IEDCR Director Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora said that the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two of the deceased were over the age of 60, two were between the ages of 51 and 60, and one was between the ages of 41 and 50.
She also said two of the dead were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
An employee of the clinic told local news agency Anadolu that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Kuwaiti Maitri clinic.
In an online video statement on Saturday, Bangladesh’s Minister of Road and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, said public transport would be shut down for a longer period than originally planned until next Saturday.
Public transport was suspended from March 26 and was due to resume on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods — medicines, fuel and food — was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Bangladesh on March 8 in two people who returned from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, those three people had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has crossed the one million mark of infections worldwide
According to Johns Hopkins University, the total number of cases of coronavirus infection with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide on Thursday exceeded one million.
At least 52,000 people have died from COVID-19.
The milestone came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first case of infection, and Zambia recorded its first death from the coronavirus.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries in which there were no cases of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours preceding 10:00 CET (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, there were more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus infection, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that more than 1,000 deaths caused by coronavirus infection were recorded in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced tougher measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the self-isolation regime of the city’s citizens until May 1.
Earlier, President Vladimir Putin said that Russians throughout the country, despite self-isolation, will receive wages until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for 15 days; the results of the vote: 215 votes in favor, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia has extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, while previously the curfew lasted only from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand was planning to introduce a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has announced that the state's home-isolation regime has been extended until May 1.
Shops in Australia limit the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at a time
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at one time in all stores in the country to two and one package, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a limit on one package.
These restrictions were reported in the ads at the box office, as well as on the network page on Facebook.
Citizens reportedly began making emergency supplies due to fears that COVID-19 could result in the introduction of a general self-isolation regime.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the amount of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Earlier, on March 4 and 5, respectively, Woolworths and Coles have already limited this amount to 4 packages.
The Coles chain said in a press release on March 8 that with the introduction of a limit on four packages, “many stores are still buying up toilet paper too quickly — one delivery in an hour,” and called such demand “unprecedented,” while ALDI in a Facebook post published on Tuesday called such a trend “unexpected.”
According to the representative of Woolworths, last week there was a sharp increase in sales.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also limited that amount to two packages.
To fill the deficit, Coles began ordering larger batches from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional batches, while ALDI made provisions for a special early sale promotion on Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to replenish supplies, but that was hampered by local authorities' restrictions on truck timetables.
He expects an increase in the cost of production, as suppliers try to meet the demand, but at the same time there are fewer and fewer profitable offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to the depletion of stocks, some stores cannot hold shares on Wednesdays.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said that stores replenish stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky product, so the number of stocks is small, and after the sale of the entire volume of goods, long rows of shelves remain empty, increasing the feeling of lack of stocks.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if shelves could be filled, and products like toilet paper rolls and hand sanitizers could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, shoppers probably wouldn’t panic so much,” says Russell Zimmerman.
Last Wednesday, the manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap announced the end of stocks.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the toilet paper company Kleenex and Solaris Paper, which also manufactures Sorbent products, said they were working around the clock to ensure sufficient supplies.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne fell due to the lack of buyers for the Labor Day week, some real estate sellers began offering free toilet paper to the first bidders.
The Thursday edition of the daily NT News, printed in Darwin, included an eight-page tab designed to be cut out and used as toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia’s March 3 report, stores were initially reluctant to impose limits on the number of items purchased, saying they had no plans to do so.
Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including medical masks, hand sanitizers, haberdashery, handwashing products and flour.
Similarly, in addition to events in Australia, on Sunday evening it was noticed that the online store of the British supermarket Ocado also limited the sale of Andres toilet paper to two packages of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization Announces COVID-19 Pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of the COVID-19 infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
Although the term “pandemic” only describes the extent of the disease, not the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that national governments need to take action:
“All countries together are still able to influence the development of the pandemic.”
This is possible if countries are engaged in identifying, testing, treating, isolating, tracking cases, and mobilizing their citizens,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
“We are deeply concerned about both the alarming level of spread and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented.”
He said in an interview broadcast on CNN in February that “no other respiratory virus other than influenza has yet been traced from its inception to continuous global spread.”
Mr. Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying that “we have never seen a pandemic caused by the coronavirus.
We have also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before.”
First, in January, WHO declared the outbreak of the disease an emergency in the field of public health of international importance, and then gave it a new status - a pandemic.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak: “This is just the beginning, it’s going to get worse.”
According to the Associated Press, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 were reported worldwide on Thursday, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–2020 coronavirus pandemic is the current coronavirus disease pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and on January 30, 2020, an international public health emergency was declared, which was subsequently, on March 11, 2020, recognized as a pandemic.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases had been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China is 4%, while in the world it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Currently, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping a distance between people, identifying and ensuring self-isolation of people suspected of their infection.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk controls and closures of various facilities.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic consequences, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortages of goods exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities were closed nationally or regionally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of students worldwide.
Disinformation about the virus began to spread on the Internet, there were cases of xenophobia and discrimination against citizens of China, other citizens of East and South-East Asia, or people resembling them externally, as well as against other groups of people living in areas where there were significant cases of the spread of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel and the closure of heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
On December 31, 2019, the health authorities of Wuhan (the capital of Hubei Province), China, reported cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause, and an investigation into the situation was launched in early January 2020.
Cases of infection have mainly been linked to the wholesale market for Huanan seafood, so the virus is believed to have zoonotic origins.
The virus that caused the outbreak of the disease is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a newly discovered virus that bears great similarities to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the very first case of the disease occurred on December 1, 2019, and the infected person did not visit the market after that date.
Two-thirds of the infections reported in December 2019 were related to this market.
On March 13, 2020, the publication of the South China branch of the Morning Post newspaper, the information of which has not been verified, suggested that the very first case of infection occurred with a 55-year-old resident of Hubei province on November 17, 2019. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that the number of new cases of infection in China has decreased, but the number of new cases in China has increased unexpectedly in Italy, Iran and South China.
The number of cases of the disease can be significantly reduced, in particular, due to the multitude of cases with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, with patients aged 19 and younger accounting for less than 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide. United Kingdom Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected by the time effective group immunity was established in the country's population.
The statistics include cases of infection of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test turned out to be positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has been able to test more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, have adopted official policies prescribing not to test for only minor symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that 86% of cases of COVID-19 infection were not detected in China before January 23, and that such unregistered patients became the source of infection for 79% of registered cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 showed that the number of cases of actual infection in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproductive infection number (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that the figure could be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 recover safely.
In other, more complex cases, the time from onset of symptoms to death ranged from 6 to 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths occurred in persons over 60 years of age, and 75% of those killed had comorbidities, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official death data from the COVID-19 pandemic usually include deaths of patients with positive COVID test results, performed according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 can be much higher, as official figures may not take into account deceased people who have not been tested – for example, in the event of death at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Incomplete data for Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID-19 figures by 4-5 times.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits: “We know [the reported death toll] is lower than the actual one.” His words are corroborated by reports of some isolated cases in the U.S. Such an account with incomplete data is often found in pandemics such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was reported in Uha in January.
The first death outside mainland China was recorded on February 1 in the Philippines and outside Asia in France on February 14.
By February 28, more than a dozen deaths had been reported outside mainland China: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths. Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.
All rates vary by region and time of disease spread; they are also affected by testing volumes, quality of health systems, treatment regimens used, time since outbreak onset, and population parameters such as age, gender, and general health. Mortality/morbidity ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases of infection within a given time interval.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 10, 2020, the global number of deaths and cases is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
Data vary from region to region.
In China, the mortality-to-morbidity ratio has decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms occurring January 1–10, 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms occurring after February 1, 2020). Other methods include the determination of morbidity mortality rate (CFR)—the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from the disease, and the percentage of deaths from infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage
These statistics are not tied to a specific time and reflect the indicators of certain groups of the population from the moment of infection to the end of the course of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these indicators for specific groups of people.
According to the Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, the overall mortality rate from this pandemic is between 0.1 and 0.39%.
The upper figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first arbitrary COVID-19 testing in Germany, as well as with a statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
The WHO says the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the exact duration of the flash cannot be determined and may vary depending on the location.
Maciej Boni, a researcher at Penn State University, states that “uncontrolled infectious outbreaks tend to reach the plateau and then, when the number of available carriers of the disease ends, they begin to fade away.
However, in the current situation, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will happen.”
Zhong Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, says “everything could end by June” if all countries can mobilize and implement WHO’s recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 “will circulate, perhaps within a year or two.”
According to a study conducted by Imperial College under the leadership of Neil Ferguson, “until a vaccine is created (possibly 18 months or more),” physical distancing and other measures will be required.
William Schaffner, an associate professor at Vanderbilt University, said: “I don’t think this coronavirus is ever going to go away, because it’s so easily transmitted,” and that it “could turn into a seasonal disease, breaking out every year.”
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific, and some infected people can carry the disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, sputum formation in the airways (mucus), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, blood clotting, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO claims to get sick in serious form with the development of respiratory problems about every six years.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists such urgent symptoms as difficulty breathing, constant pain or feeling depressed in the chest, a sudden feeling of confusion, difficulty waking up and blue face or lips. In the presence of these symptoms, you should immediately seek medical help. Further development may be necessary.
In some infected people, the disease can be asymptomatic, without any clinical manifestations, but the results of the tests confirm the fact of infection, so doctors recommend placing people in close contact with patients whose diagnosis is confirmed under strict control and examined for infection.
According to Chinese scientists, the number of cases of asymptomatic course of the disease ranges from several units to 44% of all cases.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and the appearance of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days. There is still no complete clarity on the symptom of loss of smell: according to initial estimates, the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed this symptom initially was 30%, and then fell to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small drops released into the air along with coughing, sneezing or during a conversation; close contact means contact within a radius of 1 to 2 meters (from 3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, with an open cough, drops can spread from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
There are suggestions that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets released into the air during a conversation that are able to stay in the air for a longer time. Respiratory droplets can also form when exhaled, including during a conversation, although the virus is not usually transmitted through the air.
Drops can get into the mouth or nose of nearby people, as well as into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to the spraying of exhalation products and, therefore, to the spread of the virus in the air.
It can also penetrate the body if a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, followed by touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus can be transmitted through feces, but the risk of this mode of transmission is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although its spread can occur both before the onset of symptoms and in the later stages of the disease.
There have been cases where the tests turned out to be positive when tested three days before the onset of symptoms, and this suggests the possibility of transmitting the virus before the pronounced manifestation of symptoms.
Only a few laboratory-confirmed cases of asymptomatic disease have been reported, but contact tracing studies in some countries have also identified cases of transmission from asymptomatic carriers.
Employees of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argue that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, however, it is known that one patient usually infects 2-3 other people. The virus is able to survive on surfaces from several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (304), the virus is able to live up to three days, on a cardboard surface - for one day, and on copper surfaces - up to 4 hours.
These data, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature. Domestic and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, just like, for example, after contact with other surfaces that could be touched by infected people.
Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus first detected in three people with pneumonia from the group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature in related coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed with household soap, which dissolves its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 has great similarities with the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis of the coronavirus has shown that it is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, a subgenus of Sarbecovirus (cell line B) together with two other strains of bat viruses.
At the whole genome level, it is 96% identical to other samples of bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the genome sequences of the pangolin and human viruses.
A genome-wide comparison to date has shown that the largest percentage of similarity (92%) exists between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts of the virus.
Infection with the virus can be pre-diagnosed based on symptoms, although this should eventually be confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of the infected secret or by computed tomography.
The results of a study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, since many of its imaging functions coincide with other pneumonias and disease processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a first-line testing method in the diagnosis of COVID-19.”
The WHO published several protocols for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is performed.
It can be carried out on respiratory samples and on blood samples.
The results are usually ready within a period of several hours to several days.
Usually a nasopharyngeal smear is used for the test, although a yawn smear can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies develop serological tests to identify antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them have proven to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the U.S., a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic features of the visualization of symptoms on X-rays and computed tomography (CT) include asymmetric peripheral opacity by type of frosted glass and the absence of pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is responsible for compiling an international database of images of confirmed cases of infection.
Because of its similarity to other infections, such as adenovirus, when identifying COVID-19, images not confirmed by PCR tests have limited clinical specificity.
In China, a large study comparing chest CT scans and PCR testing found that while images are less specific in the case of infection, they can be decoded more quickly; moreover, they are more sensitive and, therefore, this diagnostic method can be considered as a screening tool in infected areas.
To diagnose the virus using X-rays and computed tomography, convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, using when coughing or sneezing napkins, which should be thrown away immediately after use.
Those who may have already been infected should wear a medical mask in crowded places.
In order to prevent the transmission of the disease, it is also recommended to physically distance themselves from people. Many governments recommend refraining from any non-urgent travel to countries and areas affected by the outbreak and restricting the movement of citizens.
However, the virus was able to spread to most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading among a population some members of which do not know where or how they have been infected. Healthcare professionals caring for patients who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions, as well as precautions when in contact with other people and eye protection. Contact tracing is also an important method used by health authorities to identify the source of infection and prevent its further spread.
The use of data on the whereabouts of citizens by governments using their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International, as well as more than 100 other organizations, have made statements demanding that this type of surveillance of people be restricted.
Various mobile applications have been developed and offered for voluntary use; as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have worked on developing solutions that ensure the confidentiality of personal data - for example, recording the proximity of the user to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If the user of the mobile phone was in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test turned out to be positive, he receives an appropriate notification. There are also unfounded versions of how to prevent infection - for example, rinsing the nose and mouth, which is actually ineffective.
The COVID-19 vaccine does not currently exist, although many organizations are working on its creation.
In order to prevent the spread of the disease, hand washing is recommended.
The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends washing your hands more often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or with severe hand contamination, as well as before eating, after sniffing, coughing or sneezing.
This is necessary because, being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens its protective shell.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using hand sanitizers with an alcohol content of at least 60%.
The WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with a number of solutions (the surface of stainless steel disinfectant begins to act a minute after application) with a content of 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% povidone iodine.
Other components, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if COVID is suspected or confirmed in an institution, such as an office or day care facility, all areas of such premises, including offices, toilets, common areas, electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by sick people should be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend that when coughing or sneezing, cover the mouth and nose with the back of the elbow or napkin and immediately throw away used hygiene items.
Those who may have been infected are advised to use medical masks, as the use of a mask may limit the volume and range of exhalation products that are dispersed in the air when talking, sneezing, and coughing.
The WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “using a medical mask can reduce people’s tendency to touch their face, and touching their face with dirty hands is the main way of infection.” Masks are also recommended for use by caregivers who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as those caring for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of a mask does reduce the number of touches to the face.
Several countries have begun calling for the use of medical masks in public places.
CDC centers, USA, recommend wearing non-medical tissue face masks. China has separately emphasized the importance of using disposable medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or public places.
Health officials in Thailand are urging people to make face masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are not allowed to go outside without masks covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, the Vietnamese government appealed to all citizens to wear masks in public places in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for all food shop visitors to wear medical masks.
The Israeli government has also asked citizens to wear masks in public places.
On April 1, in Taiwan, where ten million medical masks are produced per day since mid-March, medical masks were ordered to be used by all passengers on trains and intercity buses.
In Panama, residents are required to wear a medical mask when going outside; those residents who cannot purchase masks were advised to sew them themselves at home.
Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is an infection control measure aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters and shopping malls.
People can use social distancing measures by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded places, using contactless greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many regional governments, particularly those severely affected by the outbreak, are now prescribing or recommending social distancing.
The maximum number of people who can gather in one place, as recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations, was quickly reduced, from 250 people (in regions where there was no data on the spread of COVID-19), to 50 people, and later - up to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned gathering in groups involving more than two people. The elderly and people suffering from such diseases as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and a weakened immune system, face an increased risk of contracting the virus in a serious form. CDC recommend them to stay at home as long as possible for health reasons, if in the region there is an outbreak of the disease.
The use of the term “social distancing” has been understood in such a way that people should subject themselves to complete social exclusion, instead of staying in contact with other people in alternative ways. Some agencies have published guidelines on sexual health that should be used during a pandemic.
Among other things, there have been recommendations to only have sexual intercourse with your regular partners, with whom you live, and who you are sure that he does not have the virus and its symptoms.
Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they are infected are advised to self-isolate at home.
Health authorities have published detailed instructions for proper self-isolation, and many governments have made it mandatory or recommended that the entire population of the affected areas self-quarantine.
Those in high-risk groups were placed under strict quarantine.
Individuals who may have been in contact with COVID-19 infected persons, or who have recently visited a country or region heavily affected by the epidemic, have been recommended to be quarantined for 14 days since the last possible contact.
Strategies to control the outbreak include containing, suppressing or mitigating the spread of the disease.
Controlling the spread of the disease is carried out in the early stages and aims to track and isolate those infected, and also implies other measures of infectious control and vaccination to stop the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.
At the stage when the spread of the disease can no longer be contained, efforts are being made to mitigate the effects: measures are being taken to slow down the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on the health system and society.
Containment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
Suppression of infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the base number of cases of infection to below 1. Part of the effort to manage the outbreak of an infectious disease is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic, known as the epidemic curve alignment.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overburdening health services and provide more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help cope with the outbreak include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, the use of medical masks and self-isolation; public measures aimed at physical distancing such as the closure of schools and the abolition of mass events; community involvement in facilitating the implementation of such measures and participation in them; and measures to protect the environment such as environmental protection.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, mass screening and localized quarantines were introduced, as well as an alert system for the movement of infected persons.
In Singapore, financial support was provided to infected individuals in self-isolation and large fines were imposed on those who did not.
In Taiwan, increased production of medical masks and fined for accumulating excess stocks of medicines. Modeling in the UK and the US has shown that there are serious problems in terms of mitigation (slowing down, but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (stopping the growth of the epidemic).
Optimal disease mitigation policies can reduce the peak health burden by two-thirds and the mortality rate by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Suppression may prove to be the preferred method, but it must be used as long as the virus circulates in the population (or until a vaccine is developed, if it happens sooner), otherwise the spread of the disease will quickly resume when the measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to contain the pandemic has resulted in social and economic costs.
There are currently no antiviral drugs approved to treat COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking enough fluids, and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support.
The use of steroid drugs can only hurt.
Several compounds that have previously been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also being considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also reported that some “traditional and home remedies” can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO considers capacity building and health-care adaptation to the needs of COVID-19 patients as the primary response to an outbreak of the disease.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health care services to help reallocate resources at several levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, cancelling non-urgent procedures where possible, identifying the virus and isolating patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis.
There are various theories about where the very first case of infection could have occurred – the so-called “zero patient”.
The first known case of infection with a new coronavirus infection probably took place on December 1, 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
Over the course of the month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei province gradually increased.
They were mainly related to the wholesale market of Huanan seafood, which also sold live animals, and one of the theories is that the virus entered the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus has zoonotic origin. On December 26, a case of massive pneumonia of unknown origin was registered in the Hubei province clinic, with which the doctor Zhang Tsian worked on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors from Wuhan’s central clinic warned their colleagues about a “coronavirus similar to SARS.”
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police about the responsibility for spreading false rumors, and the doctor, Ii Feng, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the panic.
Later, on December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice and informed WHO of the situation.
Wuhan health authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which turned out to be large enough to initiate an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In the beginning and middle of January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, facilitated by the Chinese New Year holidays and the fact that Wuhan is a transport and main railway hub.
On January 20, China reported 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to more recent official data, by January 20, 2020, 6,174 people had already developed symptoms of the disease. As of March 26, the United States had overtaken China and Italy in the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases had been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 people had died, and more than 364,000 had recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one reported case of infection.
Due to the pandemic, many European countries in the Schengen area restricted free movement and established border controls.
National response measures included measures to contain the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as mandatory stay at home, mandatory shelter at home or isolation), as well as curfew. As of April 2, about 300 million people, or about 90% of the population of the United States, were on some form of quarantine, more than 50 million people are in isolation from the Philippines, and about 59 million people are in South Africa.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later this figure increased to 2.6 billion people - about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Wuhan on December 1, 2019; according to another report, the accuracy of which has not been verified, this date is November 17.
On December 26, Dr. Zhang Jixiang was working with a case of a massive pneumonia of an unknown type, which on December 27 her clinic notified the Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the city of Wuhan.
Initial genetic testing of patient samples, which took place on December 27, 2019, showed the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
On 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice.
The WHO was notified on the same day.
In connection with such notifications, the police warned doctors in Wuhan about the responsibility for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
Initially, the Chinese National Health Commission claimed that there was no “clear evidence” of the ability of the newly discovered virus to be transmitted from person to person.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign to contain the spread of the virus, which was later described by Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping as a “people’s war.”
The events of “the largest quarantine in human history” began to unfold, on January 23 it was announced a sanitary border and a ban on entry to Wuhan and back, later this measure spread to a total of 15 cities in Hubei province and affected a total of about 57 million people.
In the city banned the use of personal transport.
In many places, Chinese New Year celebrations have been cancelled (January 25).
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary Huoshenshan hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital was built, Leishenshan, which received other incoming patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has also repurposed 14 other institutions in Wuhan, such as conference centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government took additional measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health certificates to travelers and extending the Chinese New Year celebration period.
Universities and schools were closed across the country.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have introduced a remote mode of operation.
In Hubei province and beyond, travel restrictions have been imposed.
The public transport schedule was changed and museums across China were temporarily closed.
In many cities, the regime of control of the movement of citizens was introduced, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some form of restrictions on outdoor movement. After the outbreak entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "import" of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. As of 23 March, only one case of domestic transmission had been reported in mainland China, which had occurred five days earlier, in this case from a person returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestically transmitted disease cases had largely been halted and the outbreak in China had been brought under control.
On the same day, restrictions on travel to Hubei, except Wuhan, were lifted, this happened two months after the closure of the province for quarantine. On March 26, 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that from March 28, entry for persons with a visa or residence permit will be suspended. The exact date of cancellation of this order was not announced.
Those wishing to come to China will have to apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
On March 30, the Chinese government called on enterprises and factories to resume work and provided companies with packages of monetary incentives. On April 4, at 10:00 a.m., a national three-minute “minute of silence” was held, which opened the day of mourning for the victims of coronavirus, declared by the State Council of the country and coinciding with the holiday of Quinminh, but the central government repeatedly asked citizens to pay tribute online.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 had spread to South Korea from China on January 20, 2020.
On February 20, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in confirmed cases of the disease, largely due to the large number of followers of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shinchonji in Daegu.
Shinchonji's followers came to Daegu from Wuhan, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, out of 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261 (about 13%) reported having symptoms of the disease. On 23 February 2020, South Korea had the highest level of anxiety.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, and by 29 February, the figure had risen to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases have been quarantined after tests showed three soldiers had been confirmed to have the virus.
The outbreak affected the number of trips, therefore, the flight schedule of airlines was changed. South Korea has deployed a program to screen the population for the presence of the virus, track contacts and organize quarantine measures for contact persons. This program is considered the largest and best in terms of its organization worldwide.
The screening methods included mandatory notification of their symptoms via a mobile application by all those arriving from abroad, a round-the-clock testing for the virus, the results of which were ready the next day, as well as an expansion of testing capabilities that allowed up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
The South Korean program is considered successful in combating the outbreak of the disease, despite the fact that it did not isolate entire cities. Initially, South Korean society was divided due to the reaction of President Moon Jae-in to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president's actions or called for Mr. Moon to be impeached for what they believed was an inadequate government response to the outbreak.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of cases in a single day for four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that from April 1, all new arrivals from abroad will be placed in a two-week quarantine.
According to media reports, 121 countries sought help in testing for the virus in South Korea on April 1.
On February 19, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later in the day.
The first measures introduced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, colleges and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020, that the government had no plans to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals would be quarantined.
In March, plans were announced to restrict long-distance travel, but intense movement between cities before the Persian New Year continued.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China in February.
Amid claims of concealment of the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran, by February 28, more than a dozen countries had linked their cases to Iran, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak there may be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that date.
Iran’s parliament was closed, and 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus as reported on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch called on Iran’s prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, as well as to temporarily release all prisoners eligible for this category.
The organization states that there is an increased risk of the virus spreading in closed institutions, such as prisons, where there is a lack of adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in one day, the highest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
By March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from the disease.
As of March 23, there were 50 new coronavirus cases every hour in Iran and one new death from the coronavirus every ten minutes.
According to the WHO representative, the incidence rate in Iran may be five times higher than the data reported at the official level.
It is also assumed that US sanctions against Iran may affect the financial capabilities of the country in terms of protection against the spread of the virus.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for easing of economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, it was confirmed that the disease had reached Italy, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
The number of cases has risen rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
An unassociated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later discovered. It all started with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree on containment of the outbreak, according to which more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were placed under quarantine.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: “The entry into and exit from the outbreak zone will be blocked.
On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the closure of all schools and universities across the country, as 100 people had already been killed in Italy.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but on March 9 all sporting events were postponed for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the closure of businesses with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations on medical ethics regarding prioritization protocols for patients that may need to be activated.
On March 19, Italy overtook China in the death rate from the coronavirus, ranking first in the world, after announcing 3,405 deaths.
On March 22, it became known that Russia sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, Italy had 128,948 confirmed coronavirus cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardy region.
One CNN report notes that such a high mortality rate in Italy can be facilitated by a combination of two factors – a large number of elderly citizens of this country and the lack of opportunity to examine all those who have coronavirus to date.
The United Kingdom responded most calmly to the virus of all affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British government did not oblige citizens to observe any form of social distancing or quarantine measures.
As a result, the Government was criticized for not reacting quickly and seriously enough to the danger faced by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending that all non-essential travel and social contacts be avoided, offering people the opportunity to work from home and avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the government announced that all entertainment venues, such as pubs and sports clubs, should be closed as soon as possible, and promised working citizens to pay up to 80% of their wages, but not more than <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 a month as a measure to support the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the prime minister announced more stringent measures on social distancing and banning gatherings in numbers.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were imposed with the involvement of the police, the introduction of fines and the dispersal of crowds.
Most businesses have been ordered to close, with the exception of businesses that provide “population services,” including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, utility stores, gas stations and garages.
On January 20, in the Pacific Northwest state of Washington, a man who returned from Wuhan on January 15 confirmed the first case of COVID-19 in the country.
On January 29, the White House set up a task force to combat the coronavirus.

On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. government’s leading public health organization, announced that it had developed its own testing kit.
Despite this, population testing in the United States was not started immediately, and as a result, the true extent of the outbreak during this period was hidden.
Testing was hampered by a marriage of test kits issued by the federal government in February, the federal government’s lack of permission until the end of February to use non-state test kits that were being developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics, and restrictive criteria before the beginning of March that would allow citizens to undergo testing (this could only be done by appointment of the attending physician).
The Washington Post reported that by February 27, fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted as of March 13.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported: “Many patients, even with symptoms and a doctor’s appointment, have been waiting in line for tests for hours or days.” After Washington State reported its first coronavirus death in the United States on February 29, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, which other states also soon declared.
On March 3, classes were canceled in Seattle schools, and by mid-March, schools were closed across the country. On March 6, 2020, a group of epidemiologists from Imperial College, London, informed the United States about the forecasts for the impact of the new coronavirus on the country.
On the same day, President Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Act, under which the federal government was provided $8.3 billion in emergency assistance to respond to the outbreak.
Corporations imposed travel restrictions on employees, canceled conferences, and encouraged employees to work from home.
Sports events and seasons have been canceled. On March 11, Trump announced travel restrictions to most of Europe, except the UK, for 30 days starting March 13.
The next day, he expanded the restrictions to include the UK and Ireland.
On March 13, the president declared a state of emergency in the country, which made it possible to use federal funds to combat the crisis.
Beginning on March 15, many companies began to close or reduce working hours across the U.S., helping to combat the spread of the virus.
By 17 March, the epidemic had been confirmed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. On 23 March, it was reported that 10,700 cases per day had been reported in New York, which was higher than the total number of cases in South Korea.
On March 25, the governor said social distancing was likely an effective measure, as estimates of doubling the number of cases dropped from 2.0 to 4.7 days.
As of 28 March, 32,308 cases had been reported in New York City and 672 deaths. It was reported that there were more confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States on 26 March than in any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of 8 April, 400,335 cases had been confirmed in the United States of America, with 12,841 deaths.
According to media reports from March 30, President Trump decided to extend the period of social distancing until April 30.
On the same day in the port of New York moored hospital ship USNS Comfort for 1000 beds.
On April 3, there were 884 coronavirus deaths in the U.S. within 24 hours.
The White House has been criticized for underestimating the threat and censoring publicly available information by monitoring, through Vice President Mike Pence's office, public statements and publications by health officials and scientists related to the virus.
In general, the opinions of supporters of President Trump about how successfully he manages to cope with the crisis are divided.
Some officials and commentators have criticized U.S. dependence on imports of critical materials, including essentials, from China.
In mid-January 2020, an analysis of air travel patterns was published in the journal Travel Medicine, which was used to map and predict models of the spread of the disease.
Based on 2018 International Air Transport Association data, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei received the largest number of passengers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also considered popular destinations for these tourists.
Of the 20 most popular tourist routes, Bali has been named the least prepared for an outbreak, while Australian cities are considered the most prepared. On 7 February, Australia adopted its plan of action in emergencies related to the new coronavirus (COVID-19).
In this regard, it is stated that much remains to be found out about COVID-19, and that Australia will pay special attention to border control and communication in a situation of threat.
On March 21, Australia declared a state of emergency in the field of human biosafety.
Thanks to effective quarantine measures in the public transport sector in Wuhan and Hubei, some countries planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic staff from the area, mainly through charter flights of their home countries, to which the Chinese authorities had given their permission.
Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand were among the first to plan the evacuation of their citizens.
Pakistan has said it will not evacuate citizens from China.

A New Zealand evacuation flight arrived in Auckland on 5 February; its passengers (including some from Australia and the Asia-Pacific region) were quarantined at a naval base in Vangaparoa, north of Auckland.
On February 15, the United States announced that it would evacuate U.S. citizens aboard the cruise liner Diamond Princess.
On February 21, a plane carrying 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess landed in Trenton, Ontario.
In early March, the Indian Government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On 14 March, a South African Airways aircraft chartered by the South African Government took off with 112 South African citizens on board.
A medical examination of the passengers was carried out before departure, and four South Africans who had signs of coronavirus were left in China to reduce the risk.
Only South Africans with negative coronavirus tests were evacuated.
The analyses were taken from all South African citizens, including flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, and as a precaution they all remained under surveillance and quarantined for 14 days at The Ranch Resort.
On March 20, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.
On February 5, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt and Iran) had sent aid to China.
Some Chinese students studying at U.S. universities have teamed up to collect and send aid to the virus-affected regions of China, with a group from Chicago reportedly sending 50,000 N95 respirators to Hubei provincial clinics on January 30. The Direct Relief relief organization, along with FedEx, also sent emergency relief aircraft to the Wuhan Medical Center by January 30, and 200 ambulances to the Wuhan Union clinic.
On February 5, Bill and Melinda Gates announced a $100 million donation to the WHO to fund vaccine development and treatment of the coronavirus, as well as to protect populations of “risk groups in Africa and South Asia” from the threat of the virus.
Interaksyon reported that on February 6, the Chinese government donated 200,000 medical masks to the Philippines after Senator Richard Gordon sent 3.16 million masks to Wuhan.
On February 19, the Singapore Red Cross announced that it was going to send $2.26 million in aid to China.
Japan also donated one million medical masks to Wuhan, Turkey sent medical equipment there, Russia sent more than 13 tons of medicines, Malaysia announced the donation of 18 million medical gloves, Germany sent various medical supplies, including 10,000 protective kits, the United States donated 17.8 tons of medicines to other countries, as well as financial support for 100 million dollars.
In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medicines and experts to Italy to help the population cope with the coronavirus outbreak.
Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million medical masks and 60,000 protective suits to the African Union, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for the organization to distribute to its member states.
Later, he also sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 medical masks, and 5 IVF machines to Panama.
Ma also donated medicines to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic have raised concerns about medical masks and kits for Chinese-made testing.
Spain, for example, has recalled 58,000 Chinese coronavirus testing kits, providing an accuracy of only 30%, and the Netherlands has recalled 600,000 defective Chinese medical masks.
Belgium also recalled 100,000 unusable medical masks: they were assumed to have been made in China, but later it turned out that they came from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese assistance was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched relief operations in developing countries.
The WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and contain the spread of the infection.
WHO noted a clear difference between the situation with the outbreak of SARS in 2002-2004, during which the Chinese authorities were accused of classifying information, which allegedly prevented the prevention of the disease and the containment of its spread, on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the central government “regularly updated information on the situation”.
On 23 January, in response to the central authorities' decision to impose a ban on transportation in Wuhan, WHO spokesman Goden Galea noted that while "this measure was definitely recommended not by WHO", it is also "a very important confirmation of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place of greatest spread", and called it "an unprecedented human-to-human transmission" on 30 January, after the WHO confirmed the situation.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said PHEIC’s announcement was driven by “the risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
Commenting on the travel restrictions, Mr Tedros stated that “there is no reason for measures that unduly impede international movement and trade” and that “WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement”.
On February 5, WHO asked the world community for $675 million to ensure strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting the need for urgent assistance to those countries that “do not have systems in place to identify people infected with the virus, even though the epidemic has not yet reached these countries.”
Mr Tedros also stated that “an indicator of our readiness is the degree of readiness for the epidemic of our weakest link”, and called on the international community to “make a choice: invest today or pay in the future”. At a press conference held on February 11, WHO established the official name of the disease – COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General Ant<0xC3><0xB3>nio Guterres had agreed to provide “the potential of the entire UN system in response to the problem.”
As a result, a United Nations Crisis Management Group has been established to coordinate all United Nations responses; these steps, WHO says, will allow “a focus on health response, while other agencies can use their expertise to fight the outbreak more broadly socially and economically.”
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated the creation of a joint special group that provided the work of international experts and WHO field staff in China to assist in resolving the situation inside the country and assessing the "seriousness of the disease and its contagion", organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as field visits to assess the "effectiveness of response measures at the provincial and district level, including in February, in order to make the country more aware of the need of the pandemic."
When the outbreak broke out in Iran, WHO sent a joint team to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials said that the likelihood of global spread of the coronavirus would be raised from “high” to “very high” — the highest degree of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, WHO’s executive director for health emergencies, warned in a statement: “This is the test of every government on the planet to be ready for the real world: it’s time to act.
This virus may already be on its way to your country, and you need to be prepared,” and stressed that the right response can help the world avoid a “worst-case scenario.”
Ryan also said the current data does not serve as a basis for declaring a global pandemic as a public health official, and added that declaring a pandemic would mean “we essentially recognize the fact that every person on the planet will be at risk of contracting this virus.”
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The WHO Director-General stated that WHO is “deeply concerned by both the alarmingly high prevalence and severity of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction on this issue.” WHO has been severely criticized for its perceived inadequate approach to the concept of pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
In response to the negative response to the situation, a petition was submitted to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, with a proposal to resign, which was signed by 733,000 people as of 6 April.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the importance of respecting the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone had the right to life-saving measures, and the Government was responsible for organizing such measures.
The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against any particular group of people.
The experts stressed that everyone has the right to health care, including people with disabilities, representatives of minority groups, elderly citizens, internally displaced persons, the homeless, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of state support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has established a platform designed to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to share views and make recommendations.
The country policy tracker provides information on policies across countries to strengthen health systems and the global economy, address the impact of quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and promote a coordinated global response to the coronavirus.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove and Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for taking action to combat the pandemic that began in China's Hubei province.
A number of provincial-level leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) have been dismissed for the quarantine measures they have taken in central China, and these dismissals have signalled dissatisfaction with the political establishment’s response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe the move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijiang, disagreed with the earlier statement that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, but took the side of the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 originated in the U.S. or Italy.
U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has called the coronavirus a “Chinese virus” or “Wuhan virus,” saying that “censorship in China only exacerbates the situation with the virus, which has now turned into a global pandemic,” and this statement has in turn been criticized by some commentators who argue that such an approach is racist and “distracts the U.S. from the administration’s path.”
The Daily Beast obtained access to a U.S. government cable that contained a communications strategic ploy apparently devised by the National Security Council, with the strategy mentioned as follows: “It’s all about China.
We are being asked to spread this information in any way we can, including through press conferences and television appearances. "" Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have said that China's efforts to help countries suffering from the virus are part of a "propaganda push" to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned of the presence of “a geopolitical component that includes the struggle for influence through PR and the so-called policy of generosity.”
Borrell also said that “China is pushing the idea of its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States.”
China has also called on the US to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, with some reports sending aid to the last two countries.
Jack Ma’s donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba has been banned due to U.S. sanctions imposed on April 3.
The U.S. authorities are also accused of diverting aid destined for other countries to their own country.
Medical masks have also been controversial among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has appropriated hundreds of IVL machines intended for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of support from the European Union regarding the coronavirus-covered Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italy’s ambassador to the EU, said that “only China has reacted bilaterally.
This is not a sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for Russian military paramedics, specialized disinfection transport and other medical equipment to be sent to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous “high-level political source” as saying that 80% of Russian aid was “useless or of little use to Italy.”
The source accused Russia of seeking to make a favorable impression on the world public at the “geopolitical and diplomatic” level.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio rejected the media attacks and expressed gratitude for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “by offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] suggests that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase the pace of production, they will also be able to provide retaliatory assistance if necessary.”
NATO’s Defender 2020 military exercise, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltics — NATO’s largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War — will be held in a shortened format.
The Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the exercise Defender 2020: "In the crisis situation that exists today in the field of public health, the conduct of these exercises endangers the lives of not only the US military and many European member countries, but also the inhabitants of the countries where such events are to be held." The government of Iran was also severely affected by the virus near the parliament.
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in an open letter appealed to world leaders for help, reporting that his country was experiencing difficulties in combating the epidemic due to lack of access to international markets due to sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran. The epidemic gave rise to calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, including the introduction of a single health care system.
Political analysts expected that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances for re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Due to the pandemic, diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated.
South Korea has criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine measures" after Japan announced that any citizen arriving from South Korea would be placed under a two-week quarantine in government-designated places.
South Korean society was initially divided because of President Moon Jae-in’s reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President's actions or called for Mr. Moon to be impeached for what they believed was an inadequate government response to the outbreak, and the pandemic forced countries to adopt emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators expressed concern that the move would allow Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to grant Prime Minister Viktor Orban the indefinite right to rule by decree, suspend parliament, and hold elections and punish those accused of spreading false information about the virus and government measures to combat the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been cited as the cause of several supply shortages due to the global growth in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the purchase of goods in a panic and disruptions in production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment, which arose due to increased consumer demand and disruptions in suppliers.
Panic shopping also took place in several localities; this led to a situation where essentials such as food, toilet paper and bottled water disappeared from store shelves, which in turn led to a shortage of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This jump led to a twenty-fold increase in prices compared to the normal price, as well as delays in the supply of medical products for four to six months.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, and the WHO has warned that health workers will be hit for this reason.
In Australia, due to the pandemic, buyers on the daigou system have a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
This activity led to a shortage of baby food in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food, acute food shortages were avoided in both areas.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation of stockpiles and the illicit trade in critically important products, which have proved successful, have avoided the acute food shortages that were expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy, whose agricultural output is small, has not experienced significant declines, but according to industry representatives, prices for agricultural products may rise.
The shelves of food stores remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pork stocks to ensure proper nutrition for the population.
Similar laws requiring food producers to preserve food stocks in case of emergency also exist in Italy.
The damage to the global economy has affected China: According to media data from March 16, China’s economy suffered heavily in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to combat the spread of the virus, as a result of which retail sales decreased by 20.5%.
Mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing center; therefore, it is believed that the virus outbreak poses a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
According to Agata Demaray, an employee of the Economist Intelligence Unit, volatility in the markets will continue until a clearer idea of the potential results appears.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current epidemic on global growth could surpass that of the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic.
According to one estimate by an expert from the University of Washington in St. Louis, the damage to the global supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact could last up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) began to take “urgent measures” after a sharp decline in oil prices due to falling demand from China.
On February 24, global stock markets collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On February 27, amid growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, showed the sharpest drop since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points — the largest one-day drop since the 2007–2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indexes showed more than a 10% drop.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China’s sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
Shares fell again due to concerns about the spread of the coronavirus, and the biggest drop occurred on March 16.
Many believe that there is a possibility of an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and states.
Central banks are responding faster than they did during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, closures of public places, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations not to undertake any travel.
As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines canceled flights due to a sharp decline in demand for air tickets, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British regional airline Flybe ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise line industry has been stronger than ever.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The outbreak coincided with Chun-yun, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year celebrations.
National and regional governments have cancelled a number of events involving large numbers of people, including annual New Year festivals; private companies have also self-shut down their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year’s events have been cancelled and tourist attractions have been closed in order to prevent mass gatherings of people; for example, the Forbidden City has been closed in Beijing and traditional temple fairs have been cancelled.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and districts, authorities extended New Year’s holidays until Feb. 10, instructing most businesses not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong authorities have raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and canceling the New Year celebration. The retail sector has suffered on a global scale: the hours of operation of stores have been reduced, and some stores have been temporarily closed.
Visits to retail outlets in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East have reduced their sales by 50-60%.
As a result, in March, the attendance of shopping centers fell by 33-43% compared to February.
Operators of shopping malls around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improving sanitation, installing equipment to check the temperature of visitors and canceling activities. According to an assessment by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic could leave 14-22 million more people out of poverty than it would have been in a similar situation, but without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of China’s 300 million rural migrant workers found themselves at home in their country’s provinces or locked up in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought help from the government.
According to estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, in the United States, the coronavirus outbreak can also deprive 47 million people of jobs in March, and the unemployment rate can reach 32%. Self-isolation measures imposed in India will leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers without work, receiving daily wages. A study conducted by the Anguza Rey Institute, Canada, 4
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers applied for a single social payment. Almost half a million companies in Germany transferred their employees to the government-subsidized reduced work schedule - part-time.
The German part-time wage scheme was also introduced in France and the United Kingdom.
The fields of art and cultural heritage have also been severely affected by the pandemic, which has affected the activities of organizations as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, around the world.
Cultural and art organizations have attempted to support their (often state-funded) mission of providing access to cultural heritage for the public, ensuring the safety of their employees and the public, as well as, where possible, supporting artists.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions were closed worldwide indefinitely, or access to them was restricted to varying degrees, and exhibitions, events and performances were cancelled or postponed to other dates.
In return, efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and growing consequence of the spread of the virus is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other public events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered setbacks. The Vatican announced the cancellation of Holy Week events in Rome, which are held in the last week of the Christian penitential period - Lent.
Many dioceses recommend that older Christians stay at home and not attend Sunday services; in some churches, church services have begun to be broadcast on radio, live or television, while leaders of some churches offer outdoor services.
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closed its churches, chapels, and St. Peter's Square to visitors, where Christian pilgrims no longer appear, and later other religious organizations also canceled worship services and restricted access to public worship services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gordwars.
Iran’s health ministry has announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the coronavirus outbreak, and shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia has banned foreign pilgrims and their own residents from entering the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sports events since the Second World War.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA season, and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The coronavirus outbreak has also disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to begin in late July; on March 24, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be “postponed beyond 2020 but no later than the summer of 2021”. Casinos and other gambling venues around the world have either been closed, and poker tournaments that are usually streamed live.
This has led many players to switch to online mode, and many gambling sites report a significant increase in the number of new subscribers. The entertainment industry has also suffered as various music groups have suspended or canceled concert tours.
Many major theaters, such as Broadway, have also canceled all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional offline activities, some artists and musicians began to explore options for continuing their activities and sharing their results over the Internet, organizing live broadcasts of online concerts or web festivals; this helps people of creative professions continue to perform, release or publish their works.
There are many online memes on the topic of coronavirus, many of which are humorous and smooth out the anxious moods characteristic of periods of uncertainty.
Since the advent of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism against Chinese citizens and people of East Asian descent, as well as against representatives of the population of hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Cases of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
The February news reports (when most cases were still limited to China) documented racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or received fair retribution for anything.
Anti-Chinese sentiment is also on the rise in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Citizens of China, as well as those of its residents who live in the affected areas of the virus, were supported both offline and online.
The epidemic began to spread in new countries, in particular, in Italy — the first country in Europe, faced with a serious outbreak of COVID-19; in this regard, the citizens of such regions can also begin to feel the influence of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea at an early stage of the epidemic signed a petition, insisting on the citizens of China.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan (#ChineseDon'tComeToJapan) has taken a leading position on Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, report rising levels of racist sentiment and even attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a “Chinese virus,” a view that critics see as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign citizens evacuated from Wuhan to New Sanjar.
Students coming from China’s bordering northeastern India and studying in major cities in India have reported cases of persecution related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the State Unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party, West Bengal, said the Chinese had destroyed nature and “so God avenged them.”
Later, these statements were condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, which called them a “misconception”. In China, due to the pandemic, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents flared up again: foreigners began to be called “foreign garbage” and objects subject to “recycling”.
Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all areas affected by the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have published their scientific articles on the coronavirus outbreak.
Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to the results of their research on preprint publishing servers such as bioRxiv.
A communicable infectious disease is an infectious disease from a returning pathogen, the range of spread or mode of transmission of which is often unknown.

Laboratory testing of respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and its associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and methods to detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by OT-PCR, which recognizes the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is intended only for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm fairly recent or active infections.
Detection of antibodies (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and for the purpose of population control.
Antibody tests reveal the number of people who have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too minor to be referred to a hospital, or none at all.
The exact level of mortality from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined from the results of such a test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing opportunities, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population.
As of 23 March, no country had been able to test more than 3% of its population, and information on the number of tests carried out in different countries was very contradictory.
Such differences in data are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which in some countries may be greatly exaggerated.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on breath samples obtained by various methods, including a nasopharyngeal smear or sputum sample.
Results are usually available over a period of several hours to 2 days.
An OT-PCR test performed on swabs taken from the throat is valid only during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus can disappear from the throat, continuing, however, to multiply in the lungs.
In infected patients tested in the second week of the disease, alternatively, material from the lower respiratory tract can be taken using a suction catheter, or expectorant products (sputum) can be used.
One of the early PCR tests was developed at the Charité Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 using a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis for 250,000 sets that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a set for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 based on clinical level PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It detects the gene "E", common to all beta-coronaviruses, and the gene RdRp, specific for SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group became one of the first companies to receive permission from the National Medicines Administration of China for the emergency use of a set for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 based on PCR. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDsource) its Regent
One in three genetic tests from older versions of test kits produced incomplete results due to faulty reagents and a narrow testing area conducted by the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, fewer than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using the two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and it was only after that date that state and local laboratories were allowed to begin testing.
The testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 infection based on RT-PCR across the country.
Quest Diagnostics began testing for COVID-19 nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been claimed; sampling and analysis processing must be performed in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the VECTOR State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. It was reported that on March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval to use a test that can be conducted for 3.5 hours on a large sample volume, allowing one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott laboratories for testing the Abbott m2000 system; earlier, the FDA granted a similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also receives the EUA from the FDA for a test lasting about 45 minutes.
The FDA also approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of cycles of alternating temperatures, this method can reveal positive results in just five minutes, and negative ones in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the U.S., and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. A test using a monoclonal antibody that binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) of the new coronavirus in a specific way is currently being developed in Taiwan, and there is hope for results in 15-20 minutes, similar to an express flu.
A March 2020 review of specialized literature concluded that “chest X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, whereas CT [computed tomography] results may have such value even before symptoms appear.”
Typical features detected during CT include bilateral polygonal subpleural thickening focal points of the “matte glass” type with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
Subpleural dominance, cobblestone bridge symptom, and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
The results of a study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan at the time of the current pandemic showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, since many of its imaging functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a first-line test method in COVID-19 diagnosis.” As of March 2020, the CDC recommends using the PCR method specifically for initial screening.
A partial immune response to infection is expressed in the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in humans after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity and to carry out population control. Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by on-site diagnosis (PoCT)
In many clinical laboratories, these tests will be able to perform high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the production speed of each such system.
A single peripheral blood sample is commonly used in CLT, although serial samples may also be used to track the immune response.
In PoCT, one blood sample is usually obtained by puncture of the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, the blood sampling stage is not required to take a assay. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have undergone all the necessary registration procedures and can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, the FDA has approved only one emergency use authorization test. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorizations to use their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies with the ability to fight the virus in blood samples.
The testing performance is several hundred samples within a few hours and therefore this method works much faster than a conventional PCR analysis of viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after infection. In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits it purchased produced satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients with suspected virus to stay at home: "employees of the emergency department pass a sample test tube to the patient", the patient spits in it, gives it back and after a while receives the test results. The British NHS has announced the launch of its pilot scheme to test suspicious cases at home, which eliminates the risk of infection.
Express testing centers have helped South Korea organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures than any other country. On March 2, in Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians said it was ready to conduct about 12,000 tests a day on an outpatient basis, and a week earlier they could only do 10,700 tests a week.
If the examination is prescribed by a doctor, the costs are covered by health insurance.
According to the Institute’s president, Robert Koch, Germany’s total test productivity is 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, express testing was proposed in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests taken in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that as of the calendar week 12/2020 on the SARS-CoV-2 was taken by a total of 583,295 tests, up to and including the week 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were tested positive. Researchers at the Israeli clinics Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of simultaneous testing of samples taken from 64 patients.
The construction of this laboratory was organized by the founder of BGI Wang Jiang and completed in just 5 days; simulations showed that if this laboratory had not been put into operation at such an accelerated pace, the incidence of the disease in Hubei would have been 47% higher, and accordingly, the cost of quarantine would also have been twice as high.
After the opening of the laboratory in Wuhan, Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai were immediately opened - a total of 12 cities in China.
By March 4, 2020, the daily total throughput was 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays open multiplex circuits were released, which can test up to 1,122 COVID19 patient analyses using only 93 vials. Such balanced designs can work in small laboratories, eliminating the need for robotic liquid manipulators.
By March, due to the shortage and insufficient number of reagents, it became problematic to conduct mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US.
As a result, some authors have turned to test sample processing protocols that provide for heating samples at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes with the aim of releasing RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March it was announced that the amount of coronavirus testing being conducted by the United Arab Emirates per capita is currently higher than that of any other country, and soon the majority of the population will be protesting.
This was due to the rapid testing capabilities, along with the acquisition of the Group 42 and BGI mass testing laboratory (created on the basis of their Huo-Yang emergency detection laboratories in China).
The laboratory, deployed in 14 days, is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the world’s first laboratory of such scale operating outside China.
Different testing options targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of test kits, which are sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Sanitary and Epidemiological Centers was not available until January 28, which led to the absence of test kits in the US. At the very beginning of the outbreak, China and the US had problems with the reliability of test kits, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide the sufficient number of kits recommended by health experts.
But in South Korea, according to experts, the wide availability of testing helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the South Korean government has been working to provide testing facilities, mainly in private laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for increased development of testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the growing demand for testing, which arose due to the rapid spread of the virus, many US private laboratories, which received hundreds of thousands of samples of tests, were overloaded, and stocks of materials for the collection of swabs and chemical reagents were quickly depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The U.S. test kits developed by the CDC had “defects,” and for this reason the government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private test development. Spain purchased the test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of using these kits were inaccurate.
The company explained that the reason for the inaccuracy of the results may be an unsuccessful sampling or improper use of kits.
The Spanish ministry said it would recall kits that produce inaccurate results and replace them with other kits — Shenzhen Bioeasy kits. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased in China gave incorrect results. 1.2 million test kits purchased by Slovakia in China were also found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x87> proposed to dump them in the Danube. Atesh Kara, an employee of the Ministry of Health of Turkey, claimed that the test kits purchased in China had a “high level of errors” and the Ministry “did not use them”. The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but in early April 2020 it was announced that these kits were unfit for use.
Quarantine measures for individuals whose tests tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, as well as surveillance of people with whom such patients have been in contact, have had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, where a person died of COVID-19 for the first time in Italy, conducted two testing cycles of the entire population of about 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases of the disease were quarantined.
The entrance to the territory of the settlement was closed, and this measure completely stopped the spread of infection.
With intensive contact tracing, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore was much less intense than in other developed countries, and there was no need to impose such extreme restrictions as the forced closure of restaurants and shops.
Many of the events there were cancelled, and on 28 March Singapore began to urge residents to stay home, but schools, which ended on 23 March, opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, also coped with the pandemic through intensive contact tracing, entry restrictions, testing, and quarantine measures, but the restrictions were less aggressive.
The statistical study found that in countries where more tests were conducted compared to the number of deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because these countries were able to identify more patients with mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 test results to one of the 16 WHO control laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Seven of these 16 control laboratories are in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.
In the following graph, the "% positive results" column depends on the testing policy adopted in a particular country.
A country in which only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive result as a percentage compared to a country in which all citizens are tested, regardless of whether there are symptoms of the virus, under other equal conditions.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the process of cleaning your hands to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other harmful substances.
Regular hand washing with soap at certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the fecal-oral route.
A person can also become infected with respiratory diseases such as the flu or the common cold, for example, if they touch their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes) with unwashed hands.
Five critical points during the day, after which you should wash your hands with soap: before and after defecation, after washing the baby's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding the baby, before eating, and before and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after the procedure of caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or washing a child who went to the toilet.
After snorting, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, feed or waste of animal origin.
Medical hand hygiene refers to the hygienic actions associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before taking medications or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause diseases), as well as chemicals that can be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is especially important for people who are engaged in cooking or working in the medical field, but it is also important for all other people.
Hand washing is very good for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious types of diarrhea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
It also reduces the infant mortality rate at home.
A 2013 study found that better hand washing can lead to a slight acceleration in the growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by adopting simple habits such as hand washing with soap.
This basic procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Regular reminders of the benefits of hand washing can reduce diarrhea by about a third, and this is comparable to the benefits of providing low-income regions with clean water.
A 48% reduction in diarrhoea can be attributed to handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory disease (ARD), provided that appropriate habits are developed in every home, school and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main complications of ORI, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, which kills approximately 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia in general kill nearly 3.5 million children every year.
The United Nations Children’s Fund reports that hand-washing with soap before meals and after the toilet, which has become a habit, could save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce diarrhoeal deaths by almost half, and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation activities carried out under the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also prevents impetigo, a disease that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small negative consequence of frequent hand washing is that it can lead to drying of the skin, and, consequently, to its damage.
A 2012 Danish study found that washing your hands too often can lead to itching and peeling of the skin – a disease known as eczema or dermatitis of the hands, which is especially common among health care workers.
Too frequent hand washing can also be considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five so-called "critical moments" during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal-oral transmission of the disease: after emptying (urinating, defecating), after washing the baby's buttocks (changing diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or poultry.
Some other cases when you should wash your hands to prevent the transmission of the disease: before or after treatment of a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or sniffing, after touching animal waste or animals, after touching garbage.
In many countries, the procedure of hand washing with soap is quite common.
A study on handwashing, which was conducted in 2015 in 54 countries, showed that on average for 38.7% of families washing hands with soap is a common practice. A 2014 study showed that the highest rate, 97%, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the US in this list is closer to the middle, their rate is 77%; the lowest rate was recorded in China for handwashing.
The “emergency health programme” implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines is an example of large-scale measures to promote children’s health and improve children’s education.
This national program is based on deworming, which is carried out twice a year, as well as daily hand washing with soap and daily brushing with fluoride.
The same programme is being successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removal of microorganisms from the skin occurs more effectively if soap or detergents are added during the washing process.
The main action of soap and detergents is to eliminate barriers to solubility and increase its level.
Water itself is not considered an effective means of cleansing the skin, since fats and proteins, which are components of organic impurities, dissolve poorly in water.
A sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the purification process.
Solid soap, due to repeated use, may also contain bacteria that may get on it during previous use.
A small amount of research on getting bacteria on the skin from a contaminated piece of solid soap suggests a low probability of getting it, as the bacteria wash off with foam.
The CDC still claims that “liquid soap with a hand dispenser is the preferred option for hand washing.”
Antibacterial soap is actively promoted in communities that care about their health.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that have antibiotic resistance by nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
Thus, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selective against antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not match the advertised one.
In addition to the surfactant and skin protection agents, complex compounds can contain acids (acetic, ascorbic, lactic) as a pH regulator, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other fragrances (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the School of Public Health of the University of Or
Hot water comfortable for human skin temperature is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at a body temperature of 37°C.
However, to remove the natural fats that hold pollution and bacteria, warm soapy water is more effective than cold.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of microbial load on the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a hand hygiene product that does not contain water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-free hand sanitizers began to gain popularity (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, hand sanitizers, or antiseptics).
Most of these agents are made on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with the addition of thickeners, such as carbomer (a polymer of acrylic acid) in the form of a gel, or moisturizers, such as glycerin in liquid or foam form, providing ease of use of these agents and reducing the effect of drying the skin with alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively destroy microbes.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis sticks, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Disinfectants containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria (a 3.5 logarithm reduction is similar to a 35 decibel reduction) on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% – 99.999% of bacteria (a 4–5 logarithm reduction) on the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are practically ineffective against viruses of the norovirus (or Norwalk) type, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. It is necessary to use a sufficient amount of antiseptic or alcohol-containing agent to carefully process and soak the skin of the hands on both sides.
The front and back surfaces of both palms, as well as the space between the fingers along the entire length, are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is completely absorbed.
Finger tips on both hands should also be washed thoroughly. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends making a choice in favor of hand washing rather than using disinfectants, especially if the hands are heavily contaminated.
The growing popularity of such disinfectants is due to their ease of use and the rapid destruction of microorganisms, but they should not serve as a substitute for full hand washing, if there is an opportunity to use water and soap.
Frequent use of hand sanitizers on an alcohol basis can cause dry skin, if their composition does not contain emollients and (or) skin moisturizers.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and (or) other emollients to the composition of the product.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollient components caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants practically do not occur.
The lower likelihood of irritant contact dermatitis was a factor in favor of choosing disinfectants over soap and water.
Despite its effectiveness, water-free products do not cleanse the hands of organic substances, but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogenic microorganisms as regular soap and water, since when using such tools, pathogenic microorganisms still remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of an alcohol-free hand sanitizer is largely dependent on its components and composition, and has historically proven to be significantly lower than that of alcohol or alcohol-containing agents.
More recently, it has been shown that drugs that use benzalkonium chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to lose efficacy after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and substitute it with ash or clay.
Ash or clay may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One problem with this method is that if clay or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it can, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant, since it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends using ash or sand as an alternative.
To prevent infection, the Centers for Disease Control in the United States recommend using a handwashing technique that includes the following steps:
Rinse your hands under warm or cold running water.
It is recommended that running water, because standing water can be contaminated, but the temperature of the water just does not matter.
Wash your hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of your palms, as well as the area between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that when using soap (and not just water alone) people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly.
Three hands for at least 20 seconds.
Friction helps remove germs from the skin, and the longer you rub your hands, the more germs are removed.
Wash your hands thoroughly under running water.
Flushing hands in standing water can trigger re-infection.
Wipe your hands with a clean towel, or let them dry on their own.
Wet and wet hands are easier to get dirty. Most often, people ignore areas such as the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use a moisturizing lotion to prevent hand skin drying, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If running water and soap are not available, there are many different inexpensive ways to wash your hands: pouring water from a hanging canister or bottled gourd with holes made and (or) using ash, if necessary, as it happens, for example, in developing countries. In places with limited water supply (e.g., in schools or rural areas in developing countries, there are other solutions such as tap water)
A foot pedal crane is a simple construction consisting of a container suspended on a rope and a foot lever that should be pressed to allow water to pour over the hands; a piece of soap should be used.
Effective hand drying is an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing body of research shows that paper towels are far more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study sponsored by the European Symposium on the Production of Paper Napkins and Towel; the subject of this study was a comparison of the level of hygiene of paper towels, hand dryers with warm air and more modern flow air dryers for hands.
It was found that after washing and drying hands in a dryer with warm air, the total number of bacteria on the pads of the fingers on average increases by 194%, and on the palms by 254%.
It was also found that after washing and drying hands in a dryer with air flow, the total number of bacteria on the pads of the fingers increases by 42%, and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the pads of the fingers on average decreases to 76%, and on the palms - up to 77%. Scientists also conducted tests to determine the possibility of cross-infection of several visitors to the toilet rooms and the toilet environment with each type of drying.
The jet-air dryer, which releases air at declared speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms from the hands and from its own unit and potentially infecting other toilet and bathroom users within a radius of up to 2 meters.
The use of hand dryers with warm air spreads microorganisms within a radius of up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
No significant microbial spread was detected with paper towels. In 2005, T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to evaluate various hand drying methods.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed depending on the method of hand drying:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to drying with paper towels.
Hand cleansing with disinfectant wipes can be an alternative solution during travel in the absence of soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
The medical method of hand washing became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its high efficiency (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in stationary conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget to do so.
According to one study, the use of such devices actually helps to reduce the level of infection.
Medical hand washing lasts for at least 15 seconds, and a large amount of soap, water or gel is used to wash and wipe each part of the hands.
Hands should be carefully rubbed against each other, crossing fingers.
If there is dirt under the nails, you can use a brush to remove it.
Since microbes can remain in the water present on the hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
After drying the hands, closing the tap, as well as, if necessary, closing and opening any doors, you should use a paper towel.
This avoids re-pollution of the hands from these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in medical institutions is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (“microbes”) and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand-washing remains unacceptable in most medical facilities: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients, and thus spread microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other basic procedures can reduce the level of blood flow infections associated with the use of a catheter by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet depicting the standard procedure for washing and treating hands, which should be applied in the health sector.
The draft WHO hand hygiene manual is also available on its website and is open to public discussion.
The review was co-authored by Whitby.
If regulatory compliance is required, commercial devices can be used to measure performance and check hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines five points when you need to wash your hands:
after contact with blood or biological fluids,
before using the antiseptic, and also
after patient care procedures. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to hand soap (“medical” or “antimicrobial” soap) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary before surgical operations or in an environment with a high content of organisms resistant to antibiotics. To "clean" the hands before surgery requires a tap that can be turned on and off without touching it with your hands; you should also use a little chlorhexidine or iodine water for rinsing the hands, sterile towels for we after drying the hands.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms to the elbow usually for 2–6 minutes.
It is not necessary to rub your hands for too long, for example, 10 minutes.
During rinsing, water from the forearm should not fall back on the hands.
After washing, the hands are dried with sterile cloth and put on a surgical gown.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after caring for a sick person.
To combat staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the first 20% of handwashing brought the greatest benefit, and that very few additional benefits were obtained when the frequency of handwashing was increased by more than 35%.
Compared with washing with antibacterial soap, hand washing with ordinary soap leads to a more than threefold increase in the frequency of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food. A comparison of hand washing with an alcohol-containing solution and hand washing with antibacterial soap, an average of 30 seconds for each procedure, showed that the treatment of hands with an alcohol-containing solution.
However, soap and water are still more effective than alcohol hand solutions, in terms of reducing the amount of influenza A H1N1 virus on the hands and Clostridium difficile spores. Hand hygiene development activities in medical institutions may include hand washing training, increasing the availability of alcohol-containing hand solutions, as well as writing and verbal reminders to the staff.
More research is needed on the most effective types of interventions in various health care settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective and important tool for improving health and even digestion.
However, the lack of a stable water supply, soap or handwashing products in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to instill the habit of washing hands regularly.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, not every private or public toilet has hand-washing taps, although there are cheap ways to organize hand-washing in such places.
However, insufficient hand hygiene can also be caused by entrenched habits rather than a lack of soap or water.
Propaganda and promotion of handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term changes in public behavior.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of such measures, it is necessary to monitor and evaluate the results.
In a systematic analysis of 70 studies, it was found that to improve the situation with hand hygiene in countries with below-average incomes, sanitary and epidemiological supervision at the community level is also effective, while public marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of propaganda regarding hand washing in schools is the United Nations Children's Fund's "Three Star Approach" approach to the implementation of the "Three Star Approach": the school promotes the implementation of the
By ensuring compliance with minimum standards, schools can raise their level from one to three stars.
The installation of handwashers is one of the possible measures implemented in the framework of information campaigns on hand hygiene in order to reduce the level of morbidity and child mortality.
World Hand Washing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children’s Fund is promoting the use of hand washing emojis.
Some studies have looked at the overall effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries compared to DALYs (retained years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that stimulating hand washing with soap is a much more economical solution compared to other sanitary measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health – especially for vulnerable categories of people such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals – was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two innovators in hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis (Ignaz Semmelweis), who worked in Vienna (Austria), and Nj<0xC3><0xB6>rence (Nj<0xC3><0xB6>rnsss).
At the time, most people still believed that infections were caused by putrefactive odors called miasma.
In the 1980s, due to outbreaks of diseases spreading through the digestive tract and infections associated with medical care, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States became more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become better aware of how important it is to wash their hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, posters with “correct hand-washing techniques” were hung next to hand-washers in public toilets, as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The phrase “wash your hands” means the manifestation of your unwillingness to take responsibility for something or be a participant in something.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate “washed his hands” when deciding to crucify Jesus Christ; this phrase subsequently found wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands involuntarily in an attempt to cleanse herself of an imaginary stain symbolizing an unclean conscience, in connection with the crimes she herself committed and prompted her husband to commit.
It was also found that people who remembered or observed any unethical act tend to wash their hands more often than other people, and for them, handwashing is more important.
It is also less likely that people who had the opportunity to wash their hands after seeing it will participate in any other “cleansing” compensatory activities, such as volunteering.
In religions, handwashing has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning. Symbolic handwashing with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual provided for in many religions, including Bahá'<0xC3><0xAD>ism, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. The religions also predate the practice of handwashing.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam require you to wash your hands after going to the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash your hands before and after each meal.
Control of production factors related to COVID-19
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19 implies the use of occupational safety and health techniques in order to control the risk and control the coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate risk control in the workplace depends on the place and the task at hand, based on risk assessment, the severity of the epidemic situation in the community, and risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) reported that lower-risk positions have minimal professional contact with the public and colleagues, and in such cases require basic measures to combat infection, including washing hands, encouraging workers to stay home with signs of illness, observing respiratory etiquette, and carrying out daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Medium-risk positions require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis but are likely to be infected due to the current spread of the disease in society or during international travel.
This category may include workers in contact with the public, such as in schools, high-density working environments and some large retail stores.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic measures to prevent infection, include ventilating with high-performance air filters, the use of protective screens and available personal protective equipment in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA believes that staff at medical facilities and morgues who have been in contact with a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are at high risk, with the degree of risk increasing to very high when such staff perform procedures accompanied by the formation of an aerosol, or collect / process samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk control measures appropriate to such personnel include the use of engineering safety measures, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, as well as personal protective equipment appropriate to the task at hand.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have different kinds of impacts on the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work due to their own illness, the need to take care of others, or fear of possible infection.
Commercial patterns may vary with respect to both the types of goods that are in demand and the ways in which such goods are purchased (e.g., making purchases during off-peak periods with delivery or service without leaving the car).
Finally, there may be disruptions in the delivery of goods from the geographical regions affected by COVID-19. The Plan for Epidemic Preparedness and Response can be used to organize protection.
The plans address the risks associated with different jobs and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors occurring at home and in communities, and individual workers' risk factors such as old age or chronic disease.
The plans also indicate the means of control needed to address such risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Epidemic preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or state-level recommendations.
Some of the goals of ensuring response to the epidemic are to reduce the spread of the virus among staff, protect people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintain business operations, and minimize negative impacts on other organizations in their supply chains.
The response is affected by the severity of the disease in the community where the business is located.
The hierarchy of risk control tools is a structure widely used in occupational safety and health to group such tools according to effectiveness.
If it is impossible to eliminate the risk of COVID-19, the most effective are engineering and technical security measures, then administrative measures and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Safety engineering involves isolating employees from work-related risks and does not rely on employee behavior, which may be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in work policies or procedures that require action from an employee or employee.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but can help eliminate some risks.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected according to the threat to the employee, fit in size (for example, respirators), used constantly and properly, regularly checked, maintained in proper condition and replaced as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid infection.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) believes that the positions with the lowest risk have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic measures to combat the epidemic, recommended for all workplaces, include frequent and thorough hand washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, adherence to respiratory etiquette, including closing the mouth with the hand when coughing and sneezing, provision of napkins and garbage containers, readiness for remote or shift work, and, if necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid.
Identifying and isolating people who could potentially be infected is a critical step to protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay at home until the heat is gone, no fever, and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of antipyretics or other pain-relieving medications, and prescribes that staff provide flexibility for family policies to stay on sick leave, to allow staff members to stay at home.
According to OSHA, mid-risk positions require frequent and close contact at a distance of no more than six feet (1.8 m) with people for whom there is no confirmed evidence or suspicion of COVID-19 infection, but there is a likelihood of infection with SARS-CoV-2 due to the spread of the disease in society in the territory where the business is located, or in connection with the recent trips of such a person to the COVID-19 distribution sites.
The following categories include workers who have had contact with the public, e.g., in schools, working environments with high population density and some large retail stores, and workers who have access to emergency equipment, workers who have access to emergency equipment, workers who have access to emergency equipment, workers who have access to emergency equipment, workers who have access to emergency equipment, workers who have access to emergency equipment, workers who have access to emergency equipment, workers who have access to emergency equipment, workers who have access to emergency equipment.
In rare cases, workers in this risk group may need to wear respirators.
If a person is sick on an airplane, measures such as isolating a sick person from other people at a distance of 6 feet, assigning a crew member to care for a sick person, providing a mask to a sick person, or asking such a person to cover his nose and mouth with a napkin when coughing or sneezing are required to ensure proper safety of employees and other passengers.
Secondary crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when approaching a sick traveler or in contact with physiological fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has a fever, regular cough or difficulty breathing.
Used gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a biologically safe bag, and contaminated surfaces should subsequently be cleaned and disinfected. In commercial shipping cases, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, safety measures include delaying travel in case of illness, self-isolation and immediate informing of others at the medical center.
Ideally, a medical examination should take place in an isolated cabin of such a person. In the case of schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person was in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
In the presence of a minimum or average level of infection in the community, social distancing strategies can be implemented, for example, the cancellation of departures for personal meetings, meetings and other mass events, such as physical education or choral singing, eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between the parties, adjusting the arrival and departure times of health care, limiting non-essential visits to children, using a separate place.
At a significant rate of spread in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, measures for long absence from school may be considered. For law enforcement officers performing daily duties, the immediate health risk is considered low, according to the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who are required to contact individuals with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are encouraged to follow the same guidelines as prescribed to paramedics, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during detention, workers must clean and disinfect their molded belts and equipment before being reused with household cleaning aerosols or by wiping, follow standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of the disease and dispose of used personal protective equipment, as well as the use and washing of clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of health care workers and mortuaries are at high or very high risk.
High-risk positions include health care, support, laboratory personnel and medical transport personnel in contact with patients with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of infection when carrying out procedures accompanied by aerosol formation, or when collecting / processing samples from people with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
Procedures associated with aerosol formation include probing, cough-causing procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or invasive sampling.
High-risk mortuary workers include staff working to treat the bodies of people with a confirmed illness or suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of their death; if such staff perform an autopsy, they move into a very high-risk category. Additional engineering safety measures for such risk groups include the use of isolated rooms for patients with a confirmed illness or under COVID-19.
In some health institutions and morgues, the use of special ventilation with negative pressure can be an effective measure.
Samples should be handled in accordance with the precautions for biosafety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be allocated to demarcated waiting areas depending on the presence of suspected COVID-19 infection. Among other personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for workers interacting up to 6 feet away with patients with confirmed disease or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as for persons undergoing SARS-CoV-2 infection education, as well as for persons with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In the U.S., NIOSH approved face respirators with an N95 filter or higher must be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program that specifies requirements for individual selection of funds and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort for the employee. WHO does not recommend the use of workwear, since COVID-19 is a disease transmitted respiratoryly, and not through physiological fluids.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for personnel performing screening at the point of admission of patients.
WHO recommends that persons collecting airway samples from COVID-19 patients or carriers of the disease without procedures accompanied by the formation of aerosols wear a surgical mask, goggles or a protective screen for the face, gown and gloves.
When carrying out procedures accompanied by the formation of an aerosol, instead of a surgical mask, you should wear a respirator N95 or FFP2.
Given the lack of availability of personal protective equipment around the world, WHO recommends minimizing the need for such protective equipment through the use of remote medicine, physical barriers, such as transparent windows, ensuring access to a patient infected with COVID-19, only those persons who provide direct care, the use of only those personal protective equipment that are necessary for a specific task, prolonged use of one and the same.

This month we are living in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the interconnectedness of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We have had no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the capacity for compassion, cooperation and community development around the world that underpins such an organization.
We’ve seen friendly and caring relationships between all of our colleagues, reflected in emails, calls and chats — a remarkable testament to the fact that, fortunately, we have amazing people working with us.
I am very grateful and proud to speak of you as colleagues.
Last week I was informed of the high appreciation of our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia right now, and how beneficial it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And this is possible thanks to your work, whether it is to ensure the performance of sites, pay our colleagues or protect the security of communities.
The world needs the information presented in Wikipedia, and today it is even more important than ever before.
At a time like this, to achieve meaningful results for the world, it is important not only what we do, but also how we do it.
Due to the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will be making important changes to the way we work together starting next week.
Adjusting the order of our work and schedules
As Robin previously said, the c-team gathered last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In the course of communication, we considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization in such a period.
The vast majority of us wanted to de-escalate tensions and support our long-term mission.
If you want to back off, so be it.
For all staff, contractors and non-staff:
We expect to work about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further orders are received.
We do not announce weekends: if you can work normally for more hours, this is allowed for the purposes of our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now; whatever your needs are, whether it’s taking care of your family, buying groceries, or going to the doctor’s office, your well-being is our number one priority.
We do not monitor your working hours.
If you are sick, you should not work.
This is understandable and indisputable, but we mention it.
You don’t need to file a sick leave or leave: just inform your supervisor and help the team revise the work calendar and schedule to ensure coverage of key areas.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, tell Brian from T&C Ops so that T&C can provide support and due consideration from management to your situation.)
The hourly rates will be paid in full.
We have already announced and confirm our intention to comply with our obligations to our contractors and employees with an hourly rate of payment.
Each person will be paid according to the usual hourly rates applied under normal circumstances.
This includes periods of illness when you can’t work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use work as a way to direct their efforts into the world around us.
What we do can yield amazing results, especially at times like these.
Again, this is about self-help.
We ask you to communicate with your supervisor so that we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered essential.
We should always support such activities.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising teams (among others) are doing critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess current objectives and shift the focus to providing support, which is critical to our mission.
There are many tasks for each of us, and we just focus on the most significant projects.
Slowing down today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We do not plan to work “twice as hard to make up for lost time” after the pandemic is over.
You won’t need to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed and will work to set new goals and timelines whenever possible.
What happens to the APP (Annual Plans)?
In order to adapt to the new reality and expectations in terms of the volume of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the deadlines for the implementation of our Annual Plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension to our 2019-2020 plan, thus providing more time for budgeting, which will allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-care and care for loved ones, and at the same time, everyone who needs or wants to work will be provided with a reduced schedule for the next few weeks.
This extension of time can significantly reduce the current planning burden and tensions throughout the organization.
Next week, we will present our proposal to the Council, provide representatives and teams with up-to-date information on the next steps as soon as confirmation is received.
Thank you to the APP team for taking the lead in this work.
The state of the office, risks and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues from San Francisco could be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, in addition to many precautions, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used medical-grade antiviral solutions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the reception and elevator halls through which access to our floor is possible.
The building is subject to its own rules, which prescribe caution, using products that ensure the safety of their tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our office in the District of Columbia (DC) is on the WeWork network, which has shared its COVID-19-related rules with us and all staff in DC.
Last week, our office in the District of Columbia completely switched to remote work in accordance with the instructions received in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the issue of renting premises in Brooklyn.
Such discussions are ongoing, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues working remotely are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended to limit the duration of meetings to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider breaking them down into a course of a few days.
Clearly define the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and send materials in advance for review.
By default, use video connection, to facilitate interaction and communication, use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
For convenience, appoint a coordinator - a person who will monitor the receipt of questions in the chat and monitor the list of speakers, as well as responsible for keeping notes (or joint notes).
If you need to use a convenient headset, contact technical support by e-mail.
Take advantage of the Wellness Reimbursement program when purchasing snacks.
Connect to the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is studying the ergonomics guides available in webinar format to promote the effectiveness of distributed work across the organization.
Last week, we asked all community grantees to cancel mass Wikimedia-funded events such as editathons until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may result in the inability to carry out agreed grant activities, and no one will be penalized for forced delays or changes to such purposes.
Next week, we will be holding follow-up events with additional guidance on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general mood in the global community is not only a sadness about the interruption of work, but also a sense of relief about mutual understanding and the ability to focus on your own communities, Wikimedia and more.
In terms of prospects, CRT is working on a page in Meta-Wiki that will provide space for the community to monitor exposure and communication.
We remain in touch on issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting to be held next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time we will take the opportunity to further share relevant information, answer your questions and spend time together, connecting to each other.
We are together in this situation and are ready to help as much as we can.
At the same time, you can still receive information from such electronic correspondence, and other important information about COVID-19 from the Office Wiki.
CRT will update such pages, and all the information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries significantly affected by the current situation.
If you have questions about travel, events, key workflow, lighting issues, or other assistance, please contact CRT.
We are ready to provide support and communication as needed.
If you have privacy issues, please email Bryan Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
No such change should be seen as a renunciation of our work and our commitments.
Rather, it is a recognition of the possible current need for a radically new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and provide an opportunity to continue working, to provide the necessary support to our movement and the whole world with the help of the right service.
Our planned work will wait until the right time.
Today is the time to support each other and create space for the important work that lies ahead in the coming weeks and possibly months.
For this to happen, we will need the help of each and every one of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, as well as to work as hard as possible once the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and other members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the corresponding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), reducing the content of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal-enzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptide domain M2 and the C-terminal transport domain of the renal amino acid collector.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein type I, its enzymatically active domain gets to the surface of the cells of the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as shidaza, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most type II alveolar cells of the lungs, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells of the arteries of most organs.
Biosynthesis of ACE2 and RNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterbalance to ACE.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into vasoconstrictor angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, cleaves the carboxylic terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Pro-Ile-O).
ACE2 can also cleave a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is present in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the primary entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Strictly speaking, binding of the S1 protein of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike to the ACE2 enzymatic domain on the cell surface leads to endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into endosomes located inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the priming of the S protein with the serine protease of the TMPRSS2 carrier, the inhibition of which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic agent. This has led some to believe that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional communities and regulators recommend continuing standard therapy with ACE inhibitors and ACE inhibitors.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, “the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the control group.”
What’s more, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients receiving ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk for pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia mortality, although the results were less reliable than in patients with a general risk of pneumonia.”
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be an innovation in therapy for acute lung injury and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory failure syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the onset of action is 30 minutes, in addition to the duration of exposure to 24 hours.
Some evidence suggests that rhACE2 may be a promising agent for people with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated.
The COVID-19 applications are mobile phone software applications designed to assist in an epidemiological investigation in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, that is, in identifying persons (“contacts”) who may have come into contact with an infected person.
In some regions, many applications officially supported by the authorities have been developed or proposed.
Several options for contact tracing applications have been developed.
This has sparked a debate about privacy issues, especially with respect to those systems that rely on tracking the geographic location of app users.
Softer options in this regard include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the proximity of the user to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would combine their efforts to integrate Bluetooth-based support for such applications directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government, together with Alipay, has rolled out an app that allows citizens to check whether they have communicated with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an application called TraceTogether is used.
The application was developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be transferred under the control of the government. North Macedonia has launched the “StopKorona!” application, which runs on Bluetooth, which helps to track contacts with potentially infected people and provides operational communication with health authorities.
The application was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting registration in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government announced that the contact tracing app is in the final stages of development and will be available for deployment within a few weeks. Similar apps are planned to be launched in Ireland and France (“StopCovid”).
Australia and New Zealand are considering the use of applications based on the Singapore application TraceTogether and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use the application with a geo-zoning function, the purpose of which is to ensure that patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security at the University of Cambridge, identifies a number of potential practical problems that can arise with application-based systems, including false positives and potential inefficiencies if only a small portion of the population uses the application.
Given concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious “coronavirus” applications, Apple has limited the list of types of organizations that can offer their coronavirus-related applications to the App Store, including only “official” or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar restrictions.
The privacy campaigners expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance of the population through coronavirus-related applications; in particular, the question was raised as to whether the surveillance infrastructure created to combat the coronavirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappeared.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
The organizations announced eight conditions for their state projects:
The monitoring must be “legitimate, necessary and proportionate”
The expansion of monitoring and surveillance should be accompanied by time-limiting clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating the spread of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of the data must be protected and evidence of such security must be provided;
Digital surveillance should exclude cases of increased discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties should be determined at the level of legislation;
Protection against abuse, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuse, should be guaranteed;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also published their list of conditions.
Google and Apple are proposing a joint plan to address the ongoing surveillance problem, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their device’s operating systems as soon as it’s no longer needed.
In some countries, network location tracking is used instead of applications, which eliminates the need to download an application and the possibility of avoiding tracking.
In Israel, network tracking was approved.
Network solutions that have access to source location data also have big potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to have access to personal location data; a number of privacy systems have been developed that use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a system that does not use apps as a basis was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a special application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transactions, and then combined them to create notifications in the form of text messages that were sent to potentially infected individuals.
The government not only used this information to warn citizens of potential contacts with infected individuals, but also made the location information publicly available, which was made possible due to significant changes in information protection legislation that were made after the MERS outbreak in that country.
Such information can be accessed through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized and confidential systems.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not yet been made public.
Contact Tracking, which preserves privacy, is a well-established concept, with a significant amount of research literature dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than ten expert groups have been working on privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record a user’s approach to other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT is a product of a coordination effort that includes both centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy-preserving tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCNs, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), privacy-preserving protocols.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all comparisons take place on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform to ensure privacy is maintained when collecting and using location data or crossing paths to track the spread of COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on research cited in the document “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” (“Hooligan Apps: How to Maintain Privacy During an Epidemic”), published in March 2020.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising the confidentiality of this data.
On April 5, 2020, groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols established the TCN Global Coalition, which aims to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracking and alerting applications, which is a key factor in their widespread adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracing initiative that they claimed would ensure privacy, and which is based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography to maintain privacy.
They also published the technical characteristics of the main technologies used in the operation of the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:
Deploying tools to allow governments to create official apps to track the movement of coronavirus-infected citizens, but keeping data confidential
By integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve problems with constant surveillance, first implementing the system through operating system updates, and then removing it in the same way after the threat has disappeared.
Drug repositioning (also known as reprofiling, redirection, task change, or therapeutic redirection of drugs) is the reprofiling of an approved drug to treat a disease or medical condition other than the one originally envisioned in the development.
This is one of the areas of scientific research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transfusion of convalescent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 drug-exposable proteins, each with multiple ligand-binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites provides a suitable basis for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ADP-ribophosphatase.
Hussein AA and co-authors in their preclinical study examined several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analyzed their similarity in structure with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a highly effective drug against SARS-CoV-2 that would be recommended for clinical trials.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used in the treatment of some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs being studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin in New York State on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment regimen has not been approved by the FDA during the clinical trial process and is permitted under EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency care in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment under the clinical trial regimens.
The CDC stated that “the use, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection” has not yet been established.
Doctors say they use the drug when “there is no other way out.”
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale research is carried out at Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University School of Medicine in Langone is studying the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine’s prophylactic use.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have shown that favipiravir is “unambiguously effective.”
The 35 patients in Shenzhen who took the drug had a negative result after an average of 4 days, while the 45 patients who did not take the drug had a duration of 11 days.
In Wuhan, a study was conducted in which 240 patients with pneumonia were observed, one half of whom received favipiravir, and the other half - umifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical authority has reminded the public that the results testifying to the effectiveness of the drug are scant and should not be considered final.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug in Japan to replenish its supplies, and use military resources to deliver it to university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe told the Trump administration about the possibility of purchasing the drug. The drug may be less effective in advanced cases of the disease.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant patients or for patients who are trying to get pregnant.
According to the results of one study devoted to the combination of antiviral drugs "lopinavir" and "ritonavir" (Kaletra), it was concluded that "the effectiveness of the use of drugs has not been revealed."
The drugs were developed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A group of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. The scientific community criticizes the reprofiling of drugs that were specifically developed for the treatment of HIV and AIDS.
WHO has included the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Subsequently, Gilead Sciences employees found that remdesivir has antiviral activity in vitro against a variety of phylo-, pneumo-, paramyxo- and coronaviruses.
One of the problems associated with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are currently being conducted, including two conducted by University of Cleveland clinics; one conducted on patients with a moderate form of the disease, and the other on patients with a more severe form.
Three clinical trials are currently being conducted for the intravenous administration of vitamin C for people who are hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without the use of placebo (Italy).
On March 24, 2020, trials of the antibiotic azithromycin began in the state of New York.
The Japan National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a clinical trial of Alvesco (cyclosonide) Teijin, an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, for use in treating pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
The Phase II trial, a form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, is conducted with 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria hospitalized with severe forms of the disease to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, involved 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who had been diagnosed with COVID-19, with mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Pregnant, breastfeeding and not using effective contraception women can not participate in this study.
In Italy, several coagulants are on trial.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which prompted the Italian Medicines Agency to publish recommendations for the use of this drug.
On April 14, a multicenter study involving 300 patients was announced in Italy to study the use of enoxaparin sodium in prophylactic and therapeutic doses.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on the re-profiling of approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics, such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese recommendations.
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese recommendations
Some antibiotics that have been found potentially suitable for use as a treatment for COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
Also tests in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a 2019 hypothetical coronavirus vaccine (COVID-19).
Despite the fact that no vaccine has passed clinical trials, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine continue to be made.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it does not expect that the vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus will be able to get earlier than 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates underwent Phase I safety studies.
The COVID-19 virus was identified in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread around the world, leading to significant investments in vaccine development and research activities in connection with it.
Many organizations are using published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are to provide the necessary speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, 10 different technology platforms were in the research and development stage to create an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in the Phase I safety studies are:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (stage I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, iRNA-1273)
viral vector (developer of stage I and vaccine candidate drug: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus vector type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute); in addition, a further 37 candidate vaccines have been reported, but there is little publicly available information on them (presumably at the planning or development stage).
Phases I-II are pre-tested for safety and immunogenicity, typically randomized, placebo-controlled, and at multiple sites with more accurate and effective doses being determined at the same time.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group; at this stage, drugs are tested for effectiveness in preventing the disease and side effects are simultaneously monitored at optimal dosages.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines in active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested in humans (still in preclinical trials).
On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was exploring the potential of a molecular-clamped vaccine that genetically modifies viral proteins to stimulate the immune response.
On January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the start of work on its own vaccine with the aim of starting human testing in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were also announced at the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
On January 29, 2020, pharmaceutical companies Janssen, led by Hanneke Schuitmaker, announced the start of work on the development of their vaccine.
Janssen, together with its biotechnology partner Vaxart, is developing an oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop a vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the development of a vaccine using a technology similar to that used for vaccination against neoantigen cancer.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced the completion of work on the synthesis of the vaccine and the beginning of trials.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it is starting a project to develop a peptide vaccine Ii-Key against COVID-19.
Their goal was to develop a vaccine candidate drug that could be tested in humans in 90 days.
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its vaccine development projects.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Support Command, Fort Detrick, and Walter Reed Army Research Institute, Silver Spring, which are located in the western part of Maryland, announced that they were developing their vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had entered into a partnership with Novavax Inc.
for the development and production of vaccines.
The partners also announced plans to conduct preclinical trials and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are studying 11 isolated patients, and that even in an accelerated mode, it will take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company based in Quebec, announced that it had created a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
The potential vaccine is undergoing laboratory testing, and human testing is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump offered CureVac “large sums of money” for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, which the German government protested.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop a vaccine based on mRNA.
BNT162 is a candidate for the mRNA-based vaccine; the drug is currently undergoing preclinical trials and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020, Italian biotechnology company Takis Biotech announced that it will receive the results of preclinical trials in April 2020, and their final vaccine candidate drug could begin testing in humans as early as autumn.
On March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), France, announced an investment of $4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine development consortium involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh. The total investment of CEPI in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine is $29 million.
Other investment partners of CEPI in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the universities of Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different vaccine candidates on animals.
Researchers at Imperial College, London, announced on March 20, 2020, that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate drug was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced $275 million to fund 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine candidate drugs at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago Initiative and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced $192 million specifically for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as plans to create a national “vaccine bank” that would include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine, on mice, stating that “MNA administered subunit SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines, eliciting strong antigen-specific antibody responses [in mice] that manifested 2 weeks after immunization.”
On April 16, 2020, the Canadian Pharmaceutical School of the University of Waterloo announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine that may be available in the form of a nasal spray.
With the help of bacteriophages, DNA will multiply inside human bacteria and form harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three U.S. universities combined the resources of IBM supercomputers with the cloud computing resources of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other benefits in addition to their disease-prevention properties.
Another randomized trial, which is being conducted in Australia, involved 4,170 health workers.
Vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Early studies evaluating the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and lower primates, point to the need for measures to contain infection with biosafety level 3 when processing live viruses, as well as international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in animal models.
As of 2020, there are no drugs or protective vaccines available to treat SARS that are safe and effective for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS has been a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide. There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS began to spread, it was thought that the SARS study that was being conducted at the time could become the standard for developing vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that has passed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three more vaccines, all of which were viral vector-based vaccines under development, two adenovirus vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vector vaccine (MVA-vector).
There was a conspiracy theory circulating on social media that the COVID-19 virus is not new and that a vaccine for it already exists.
Social media posts quoted some patients who claimed there were patents on the genetic sequences of other coronavirus strains, such as the SARS coronavirus, as well as vaccines for those strains.
Coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), which is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include feeling tired, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most cases are reduced to the manifestation of mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease flows into viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and regions, and more than 153,000 people had died from the disease.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus mainly spreads through close contact between people, often through microscopic droplets released into the air when coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although these droplets are formed when exhaled, they usually pose a threat when they hit the ground or the surface, but are not transmitted through the air over long distances.
People also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can live for 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although its spread may be possible both before the onset of symptoms and at later stages. The standard method of diagnosis is a polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (RT-PCR) on a sample taken as a smear from the nasopharynx.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients with suspected disease, as well as those who care for them.
Recommendations for the use of medical masks by the population vary: some agencies recommend not using them at all, some recommend their use, and others require it.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
Local spread of the disease has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected individuals may have no symptoms or have flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or feeling of tightness, confusion, difficulty waking up, blue face or lips; if the above symptoms are present, medical attention should be sought immediately.
Less commonly, symptoms of upper respiratory disease, such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat, may be observed.
Also, in different percentage ratios, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are observed.
Some cases reported in China initially manifested only a feeling of tightness in the chest and a rapid heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease can progress, developing into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and eventually death occurs.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, symptoms begin to appear within 11.5 days after infection. According to available data, symptoms do not appear in all infected.
The role of such asymptomatic carriers in disease transmission is not yet fully known, but preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of infection.
The percentage of infected people with an asymptomatic course of the disease is currently unknown, it is only being studied; with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that in 20% of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations for the virus, the course of the disease was asymptomatic.
China’s National Health Commission has started including asymptomatic cases in its daily summary since April 1; of the 166 cases reported on that day, 130 (78%) declined asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both sputum and saliva can have a high concentration of the virus.
With loud speech, more drops are released into the air than with normal volume speech.
A study conducted in Singapore showed that with an open cough, drops can spread at a distance of up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
The virus is usually not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission of virus particles by bioaerosol is still possible, and testing of air processed by air collectors located in corridors outside people's rooms has shown the presence of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to the spraying of exhalation products and, therefore, to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also concerns that the virus can spread through feces, however, this risk is considered low. The virus is most contagious when people show symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible even before symptoms appear, but this risk is small.
Employees of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argue that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, however, it is known that one patient usually infects 2-3 other people. The virus is able to survive on the surface from several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that the virus is able to live on a cardboard surface for one day, on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) - up to three days, and on 99% of copper surfaces - up to 4 hours.
These figures, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents, when used correctly, have a rather beneficial effect in terms of combating infection: soap destroys the fatty protective layer of the virus, deactivating it in this way, and is also able to eliminate it from the surfaces of the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective against this virus. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and in the sixth patient, the highest content of the virus in the blood was detected on the second day of testing.
Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome first detected in three people with pneumonia from the group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in naturally related coronaviruses.
Being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organ most exposed to COVID-19, as the virus enters host cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in type II alveolar lung cells.
The virus connects to ACE2 and penetrates into the host cell with the help of a characteristic surface glycoprotein - a "spike" (peplomer).
12% of infected people admitted to hospital in Wuhan were diagnosed with acute myocardial damage, which is more common in severe forms of the disease.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders seen during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial damage may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large quantities, as they are involved in the work of this organ.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was observed in patients who were in ICU with COVID-19, and may indicate adverse prognosis. Autopsy of patients who died from COVID-19 showed the presence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and lymphocytic-containing pulmonary inflammatory inflix.
Despite the fact that SARS-COV-2 has a tropism to ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with a severe course of COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was found that pathogenic GM-CSF T-cells correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL-6, and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Upon autopsy, lymphocytic infiltrates were also detected.
The WHO has also published several testing protocols for the disease.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the standard testing method.
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained from a nasal swab, but a sample of a nasal swab or sputum may also be used.
The results are usually ready within a period of a few hours to two days.
You can also take blood tests, but they require two blood samples taken at intervals of two weeks, and their results do not directly matter.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the coronavirus strain and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the presence of this virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests that could detect the presence of infection at the current time, as well as the fact of possible infection in the past, were under development, but have not yet become widespread.
The Chinese experience of studying the results of these tests showed that their accuracy is only 60-70%.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test, authorizing its use later this month. The diagnostic guidelines issued by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University list methods for detecting infection based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral polygonal subpleural thickening foci of the "matte glass" type with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are frequent symptoms detected at an early stage of the disease.
Subpleural dominance, cobblestone bridge symptom (longitudinal thickening of the septum with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
There is little data on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological examination performed at the autopsy:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, compaction and pulmonary edema
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocyte, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulation (DVC syndrome); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, observing respiratory hygiene rules, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, or, in the absence of a napkin, covering the mouth and nose with the inside of the elbow area of the hand.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended to carry out a high-quality hygienic procedure for the hands.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue face masks in public places, in particular to limit the transmission of infection by people with asymptomatic disease. Social distancing strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; as part of these measures, schools and businesses have been closed, the movement of citizens is limited and large public events have been canceled.
The distancing guidelines also imply that people must be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There are no drugs with proven efficacy against COVID-19. As vaccine development is not expected to be completed until 2021, the bulk of the measures against the spread of COVID-19 comes down to reducing the peak of the epidemic, known as “climbing the plateau”.
The CDC also recommends washing your hands more often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or with severe hand contamination, as well as before eating and after sniffing, coughing or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends the use of a hand sanitizer (alcohol content at least 60%), but only when soap and water are not available. In regions where such sanitizers are not sold, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
These formulations use ethanol or isopropanol, which have antimicrobial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not a suitable means for antiseptic hand treatment.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are shown supportive therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect they are infected with the virus wear a regular medical mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
To strengthen immunity, it is recommended to observe the rules of personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet.
Supportive therapies can be shown to patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive care physicians and pulmonologists have summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in a free resource - IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the treatment of symptoms as first-line drugs, some health care professionals recommend choosing paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen.
When performing procedures in which airborne droplets may occur, such as intubation or hand drying, precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in medical settings.
Healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19 are recommended by the CDC to be placed in air-dropper isolation (AIIR), an additional measure in addition to standard contact and air precautions. The CDC has published recommendations on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during a pandemic.
Recommended personal protective equipment: protective gown, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves. Of the above means, it is preferable to use respirators rather than medical masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respirators under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but when not used as directed, efficacy in terms of protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends using protective face shields or, as a last resort, making masks yourself at home.
In most cases, the forms of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require artificial lung ventilation or an alternative, but there is a certain percentage of cases where it is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is currently being actively studied, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a nasal oxygen cannula with intense airflow or two-level positive pressure in the airways.
It is not yet known whether either of these two methods is as effective as IVL for critically ill patients.
Some doctors opt for invasive mechanical lung ventilation if it is available, since this method significantly limits the spread of particles in the air compared to nasal cannula with intensive airflow. The risk of a severe form of the disease for older people (those who are over 60 years old, and especially those who are over 80 years old) is much higher.
In many developed countries, there is a shortage of hospital beds per capita, and the resources of health systems are too limited to cope with the sharp increase in severe COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
According to one study conducted in China, 5% of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support for the work of the lungs by ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in intensive care.
The task of providing artificial lung ventilation is complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developing in COVID-19 and oxygenation are causing more and more problems.
Inhaled pressure ventilators and ventilators are needed to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen to the lungs and to ensure minimal ventilation damage, which can lead to the development of pneumothorax.
On earlier models of fans, high PDQV may not be available.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are currently in clinical trials.
The most promising is remdesivir.
The development of new drugs may take until 2021, but some of the drugs under test have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on patients with severe forms of the disease.
WHO-recommended volunteers are taking part in trials to test the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary permission to use convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person’s life is at risk of serious or imminent danger.
Its use has not been subjected to clinical studies, which should be carried out to prove the safety and effectiveness of the treatment.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application designed to combat the outbreak of the disease.
To log in, users must enter their name and identification number.
The app can detect “close contact” using observational data and therefore determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-isolation, but also sends a notification to local health authorities. Analyzing big data collected from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence – such tools are used to track infected people and people they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government gave permission to security agencies to track the data of mobile phones of people who are allegedly infected with the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to study and prevent the spread of the virus, Deutsche Telekom provided aggregated data on the location of mobile subscribers to federal government agencies in Germany and the Robert Koch Institute.
In Russia, facial recognition technology was introduced to identify quarantine violators.
Giulio Gallera, Italy’s regional health commissioner, said mobile network operators reported that “40% of people still continue to move around the territory.”
The German government ran a 48-hour weekend programming marathon involving more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid also called for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
Rory O’Connor said: “Increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic downturn are ideal conditions for harming people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease can occur mildly with minor or absent symptoms resembling other common upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Patients with mild disease usually recover within two weeks, while it may take three to six weeks to treat patients with severe or critical forms.
Pregnant women may be at a higher risk of getting a severe form of COVID-19 based on data on other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although similar data on COVID-19 are not available. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia as a complication.
In individuals with the most severe course of COVID-19 disease, it can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.
Complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots, as well as problems with the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Abnormalities of thromboembolism, especially an increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, while renal dysfunction was observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of patients with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which patients were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
According to early-stage case studies, the average time from the onset of symptoms to the day of death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8% and among women was 1.7%.
Histopathological studies of postmortem lung samples indicate diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
In pneumocytes, viral cytopathic changes were observed.
The appearance of the lung resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were either increased levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89% of hospitalized patients had previous health problems. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region can also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates vary depending on the condition because of such regional differences, as well as because of methodological difficulties.
Insufficiently effective counting of cases in mild form can lead to an overestimation of the mortality rate.
However, the fact that deaths occur as a result of diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms overall, and such patients were about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die compared to non-smokers. Concerns were raised about the long-term effects of the disease.
The administration of one of the clinics in Hong Kong found that in some patients who recovered from this disease, the volume of the lungs decreased by 20-30%, and their scans revealed damage.
After recovery, this can also lead to “After Intensive Care” syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether the patients recovered from the virus developed persistent immunity against it.
Judging by the course of other coronaviruses, this is considered likely, but cases have also been reported where, after recovering from COVID-19, coronavirus tests were still positive.
It is believed that in these cases there was an aggravated protracted course of the disease, and not re-infection.
It is believed that the virus is natural, has animal origin and is an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, calls December 1, 2019, the earliest date of the first case of the disease.
According to official data published by WHO, this date is December 8, 2019.
Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary depending on the region and time of the spread of the disease, they are also affected by the testing volumes, the quality of health systems, the treatment regimens used, the time since the onset of the disease outbreak and population parameters such as age, gender and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned ICD-10 emergency codes to the disease: U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global number of deaths and cases is 6.9 percent (153,822/2,240,191).
This figure varies by region. Some other methods include the determination of the morbidity rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who have died as a result of the disease, and the determination of the morbidity rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed cases) who have died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not tied to a specific time and reflect the indicators of a certain segment of the population from the moment of infection to the end of the course of the disease.
Despite the fact that antibodies are not produced in all patients who have undergone infection, in the presence of such antibodies, it is possible to understand how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 people (1.7%) are no longer alive.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease spread during the celebration of the carnival among young people, causing a relatively lower mortality rate, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health care system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, judging by the indicators of donor blood.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004% of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates are different for men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher in men.
The highest risk group is men over the age of 50; the gap between men and women is narrowing only from the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact causes of this discrepancy are unknown, but may lie in genetic and behavioral factors.
Gender immunological differences, lower prevalence of smoking among women, concomitant diseases in men (for example, hypertension, manifested in men at a younger age than in women) may be the cause of higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men, and 72% of COVID-19 deaths were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not keep gender statistics on COVID-19.
Scientific studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS have different gender statistics.
The majority of health workers, especially nursing staff, are women and are therefore more likely to become infected.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease - COVID-19.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains: “CO” means “crown,” “VI” means “virus,” “D” means “disease,” and 19 is the year the outbreak was first detected: December 31, 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or groups of people, as required by international naming guidelines aimed at preventing stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In public reports, WHO additionally uses the terms “COVID-19 virus” and “the virus responsible for COVID-19.”
Both the disease and the virus itself are commonly referred to as the “coronavirus.”
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as the "coronavirus" and the "Wuhank coronavirus".
In January 2020, in line with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical locations in disease and virus names, WHO recommended the use of the terms “acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCoV” as temporary virus and disease names.
On February 11, 2020, the official names “COVID-19” and “SARS-CoV-2” were published.
Because of the limitations of standard supply chains, some digital service manufacturers print medical supplies, such as swabs for nasal swabs, as well as parts of IVL machines.
In one such case, the Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve, and the supplier could not deliver it in the required time, then one of the local productions was reprofiled and was able to print the necessary 100 valves per night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, various conspiracy theories, misinformation and fake information about the origin of the virus, its scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects began to spread at a high speed on the Internet.
Humans can infect other animals with the virus.
The results of the studies did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
There is currently no approved vaccine for the virus or drugs to treat it.
Various international studies on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines are currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO launched the Solidarity Trial program, which aims to assess the therapeutic effect of the four existing compounds considered most effective to date.
The finished vaccine does not yet exist, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidate drugs.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 penetrate human cells using the ACE2 receptor, so previous research on SARS-CoV has been used in scientific developments.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, the researchers aim to create a whole-virion vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead form, is aimed at causing a rapid immune response of the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the creation of a subunit vaccine, is aimed at creating a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies aim to destroy the S-spike protein, which helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the development of nucleic acid-based vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating a vaccine).
Experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine on four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Anti-telosomal amplification has been identified as one of the potential problems in the development of vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are being conducted.
Drugs approved for the treatment of malaria were evaluated in seven trials, four of which were on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Antiviral drug reprofiling accounts for the majority of Chinese studies; by the end of April, nine Phase III studies on remdesivir had been conducted in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 was conducted. Several other existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are also being considered for the same purpose, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in lopinavir/ritonavir.
As of March 2020, there are preliminary data on the effectiveness of the use of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients receiving remdesivir as an exception.
Phase III clinical trials are already underway in the US, China and Italy. The use of chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was reviewed in China in February 2020 and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for an expert evaluation of the study.
Health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling this dose is very dangerous and can lead to death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA authorized the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating COVID-19 patients. The Chinese guidance of the 7th edition also lists interferon, ribavirin or umifenovire as anti-COVID-19 agents.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for in vivo study in detail by demonstrating inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. Studies have shown that the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor requires priming the spike protein with transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2).
Studies of the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have serious limitations that do not allow the medical community to use these treatments without further study. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytokinemia may occur as a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is confirmation of the fact that hydroxychloroquine may have the properties of hypercytokinemia. As a result of a small study conducted by the National Health Commission of China, tocilizumab was included in the recommendations for the treatment of coronavirus.
This drug has reached stage 2 of a non-randomized test, which is conducted nationally in Italy, after positive results of its use in patients with severe disease.
Combined with serum analysis for ferritin to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counteract factors thought to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA approved an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by another cause, CAR T-cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine release syndrome.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is currently considered a non-vaccinated method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tried in the treatment of patients with SARS, but its results have been inconclusive.
Virus neutralization is the expected effect by which passive antibody therapy can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may also be used.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The use of convalescent blood serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies against this virus, can be increased.
