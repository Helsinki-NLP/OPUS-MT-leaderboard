White pawn on f3, black pawn on e6, white pawn on g4, black queen on h4 - checkmate! In chess circles it is jokingly called "foolish checkmate".
White: rook on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. Black: pawns on a7 and b7, king on a8, elephant on b8. White put the opponent in the position of zugzwang, putting the rook on a6, after which the blacks have only two options: take the rook on a6 and move the elephant on the first b8.
