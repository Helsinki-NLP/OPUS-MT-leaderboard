I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
I punched him in the jaw.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
I underlined the word “Alice” to highlight it.
I suggested it.
I put three teaspoons of sugar in your tea.
I opened my umbrella.
I gave up smoking.
I quit.
I'm raising cattle.
The Iranians are a peaceful people.
I read his book.
I read Tom a story.
I realized I hadn’t eaten yet.
I'm really getting married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like the way your hair looks.
I really like the wine.
I really like your website.
I really love your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mother's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I love to learn French.
It'd be really nice if you kept your mouth shut.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the guy.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember when I met the Queen.
I despise his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I flushed one.
Iron is stronger than gold.
Isaac Newton died a virgin.
I said I'd bring it.
I said it might rain.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I'm in.
Is anyone in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Is something missing?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw him.
I've seen him play cards with them all.
I saw him there.
I saw my sister tear up the letter.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I've seen Tom do it.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is Boston far away?
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he's done?
Are the potatoes caloric?
I don't see a conspiracy here.
"I see," said the blind man.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston with me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Is everybody busy?
Are they all happy?
Everybody having fun?
Is everything there?
Is he breathing?
Does his aunt eat an apple or a banana?
I shook my head.
I should definitely buy you a drink.
I should feel sorry for them.
I should take her home.
I need to pack.
I have to go change.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been more cultured.
I should have checked.
I should have done it yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should have refused.
I showed her my room.
Is it cold outside?
- Is it done?
Is it far from here?
Is Tatoeba really very slow today, or do I seem to be?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is it true?
I slapped him.
I sleep on my feet.
I sleep standing up.
I slept like a butcher.
I slept in the chute.
I slept on the bus.
I cut the sandwich in half.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
I smiled.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that excessive?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this great?
I kind of like it.
I spent the whole day shoveling snow.
Is she a cabbie?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really that beautiful?
Is that your mother?
I stared at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I've lost something strange.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Does that word even exist?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that sarcasm?
Is that satisfactory?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So that's where Tom is?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you won't help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge secure?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Are you paying for the delivery?
Is there a doctor here who speaks English?
Is there any food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is it a real diamond?
Is that moral?
Is this true in English?
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is this your radio?
Is anybody sitting here?
Is this place available?
Was that all the excitement?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
Somehow I still can’t believe it.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don’t understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I love the horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom conscious?
Does Tom contribute?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom funny?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is Tom looking for them?
Is Tom bothering you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
Did you talk to Tom?
Is Tom there alone?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I lit a match in the dark.
I'm studying art history.
I suddenly felt old.
I suffer from asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on finding a way out of the cave.
I suggest we go home.
I'm trying to make you bend over.
I suggest you send someone out there to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
I doubted it.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear to God, I wouldn't even bother with you if you were the last bucket of water.
I sweat every day.
Do you still have the freezer?
Is your head full of straw?
I take this opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I talked to my counselors about what subjects to take.
This whole thing makes sense.
Everything seems pointless.
It always happens the same way.
It can't be a coincidence.
So, no no.
That's not possible!
For now, for you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
It could never, ever, ever happen here.
There's no way it was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
That'd be good.
I didn't mind.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get that bad.
That disappointed him.
It would look good.
I don't mind.
It's not gonna get any better.
It doesn't look much different.
It doesn’t matter that you don’t want to do it; you have to anyway.
It doesn't matter.
Doesn't seem to be helping.
Doesn't sound like who knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I'm learning English.
It's right there.
It gave me an idea.
I have something to do.
It had to be done.
It must have come from somewhere.
It depends on your decision.
It happened too fast.
It's happening.
It's happening.
It's getting cold.
It has nothing to do with luck.
It wasn't easy for us.
It has sentimental value.
I think about it all day.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something.
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one.
I think I have a cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I think I know how to stop it from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go eat out.
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see how he's doing.
I think I love you.
I think I made a good point.
I think I write pretty well.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think I might sneeze.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French pretty well.
I think it's too risky without any help.
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it's time for you to go.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
I think I figured out what time we're supposed to leave.
I think I made a mistake.
I think I might be able to help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's silly.
I think it's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's heartless.
I think Tom's conservative.
I think Tom's brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom's wonderful.
I think Tom's cruel.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's evil.
I think Tom's nice.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's petty.
I think Tom's a schmuck.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's tough.
I think Tom's vain.
I think Tom's smart.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
I think we can get him.
I think it's better not to drink water.
We'd better not go out in a storm like this.
I think we'll join in.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're done.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've had enough to eat.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you panicked.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should choose her.
I think you should do this alone.
I think you're gonna help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you need to deal with this on your own.
I think it helped a lot.
I thought about what Tom said.
I was thinking of you.
I thought he had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I'd ask for their help.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I never thought I'd find Tom.
I thought it was coming at me.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom was having a good time.
I thought Tom had retired.
I thought maybe Tom knew where she put Mary's key.
I thought Tom might not want to come with us.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
I thought Tom would be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
I didn't think Tom would want any help.
I didn't think Tom would want to go with us.
Didn't we agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I wanted to visit the museum together.
I think you're gonna be busy.
Didn't you want the prize?
I thought you found someone else.
I thought you lost your wristwatch.
Don't you hate him?
He seemed tired.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you only dated girls who were shorter than you.
Didn't you know how to play the piano?
I thought you said you could swim.
Well, didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I thought you played chess better than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you were going to live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I didn't think you'd be busy.
I didn't think you'd like it, Tom.
I'm in terrible pain here.
Mary gets annoyed when Tom leaves the lid of the cup up.
It's a multi-step process.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day of school.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
There's no theoretical way I'm going to get the job done in a day.
It's less humid today than it was yesterday.
It's not cold at all.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Do you mind if I use that?
I'm paying.
It doesn't come into consideration.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It’s starting to dawn on us that we can’t ignore nature.
It's warmer today than it was yesterday.
It is worth quoting a famous passage of his essay.
It's written on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
It seems wrong to me.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
Soon it will be Christmas.
It will be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be worth it.
You looked terrible.
You looked funny.
Looks like you're right.
It looks delicious.
It looks different.
Seems familiar.
It looks like an egg.
Looks like I drank too much yesterday, my head's killing me, I'm really hungover.
Looks like these two are in a relationship again.
Looks like these two have calmed down.
Looks like we're gonna have a snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks nice.
That's how I got close to Tom.
He healed me.
It's bothering me.
It could be dangerous.
It might be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe it'll rain tonight.
It may seem strange.
It may be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It might rain today.
Must have been her.
I must have been amazed.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you so.
I told you I couldn't.
I told you it'd be hard to pull off.
I told you my father died when I was 13.
I told you this was gonna get rough.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
He's out of his mind.
I got back on the bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants are off.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I totally get it.
It probably won’t be worth the wait.
It was raining two days ago.
It resulted in great difficulties.
I tried to explain it to him, but he didn't buckle.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to get them to stop.
I tried to pretend to be something I'm not.
I sincerely regret that.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to worry.
It's about to rain.
It's a classic.
It was a disaster!
It is advisable to check whether there may be any negative effects if you drink alcohol while taking the medicine prescribed for you.
It's a child's game.
It's a good system.
It's all in the file.
Everything is in the room.
It's all over.
Now it's all over.
That's all they talk about.
It's all very strange.
It'll be over soon enough.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She's about to leave.
It's so much fun.
It's already seven o'clock.
It's already eleven o'clock.
It's already open.
It's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's too bad you ruined everything.
It is about integrity.
That's a reasonable compromise.
That's a false lead.
It's a risky plan.
It is a pity that the concrete does not burn.
It's a quick walk.
It's simple.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
They've disassembled it.
It's just a pain in the ass.
It's been raining for about a week now.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week is extremely hot.
It's best if you don't talk so much.
It's better to be alone.
It is better to be an optimist and a liar than to be a pessimist and be right.
“It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees, then why are you still alive?”
It's empty.
Sauna's here.
It's new money.
You scared me.
There's no one.
It's time to close.
It's cold here.
It's common knowledge that you don't like Tom.
It's dark in here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to assess his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier this way.
It's easier not to end up in jail than to run away.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily distinguish them.
I guess I misjudged him.
It looks like her style.
I think that’s the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's bad to swear.
It's exactly ten o'clock.
That's exactly what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's fair.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's ridiculous.
Watching TV is fun.
He's getting dressed.
It's getting dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's gonna be beastly.
It's gonna get colder.
It's gonna happen soon.
It's good to see you all again.
That's good training.
That's good.
It got better.
It's a lot of fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's hot in here in hell.
That's supposed to be possible.
This shouldn't take long.
I care what you think of Tom.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
It's in excellent condition.
It's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
It's a simple question.
It's just made up.
Just sit there.
It's a little further.
It's locked.
It's made of leather.
It's my call, Tom.
It's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to bring gifts like this.
It’s nice to feel like you need someone.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big miracle.
It's noisy in here.
It's none of your business!
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
That's not a big priority.
It's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not the other way around.
That's not exactly how it happened.
It won’t be easy without a lot of help.
It's not hard to stand out when you're surrounded by fools.
It's no big deal.
It's not just a guess.
It's not an ordinary pen.
There is not enough light to read.
It's not like we're doing anything.
It's not my call.
It's not my fault.
You don't have to.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too soon.
It's not up to you.
It's not often that someone buys a thousand-dollar hat.
It's not worth much.
It was snowing last night.
It's obviously a typo.
It is obvious to everyone that he is in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
That sounds really strong.
That sounds really good.
Our job is to help them.
It's all white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
He probably still has it.
It's probably still available.
It's busted.
Actually, it's pretty common.
It's delicious.
It's very possible I'm wrong.
It's entirely possible that Tom won't help us at all.
It's very simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really gross.
It's a real shame.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's strong!
It's awesome!
It's so obvious we don't need evidence.
It's starting to get dark.
It's still dark outside.
It is still on sale.
It still works.
It's not working yet.
It's still growing.
It's still there.
It's weird how people in the tropics eat spicy food like curry.
It's stuck.
Its surface was as flat as a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best turkey I've ever tasted.
It's a spider bite.
I'm so scared!
It's time to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It is too risky to fight them in the place of their choice.
It's really strong.
It's bullshit.
It's totally wrong.
He can't stand the heat.
It is unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really warm.
I need to see Tom right away.
It's very relaxing.
It's very simple to understand.
It's warm in here.
I'm guessing nothing.
There's wind.
It's from work.
You're losing.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
It only takes three minutes to boil the water.
It's been going on all night.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
I turned on the fan and pointed it at the wall.
I turned on the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I turned it down, Tom.
It was a great honor to be asked to give a speech.
It was so beautiful.
That was a shame.
It was after midnight.
It was an arraignment day.
It was a great series.
It was all my idea.
It was all right here.
Everything was so easy.
It was an amazing evening.
It was an ambush.
It was a terrible sight.
It's been an honor.
It was an offer I could not refuse.
It was a gift to me that I spent the evening with a smart, witty, and beautiful girl like you.
It was an extraordinary experience.
That was a surprise.
It was a wonderful experience.
It was a tough test.
It was a warm night.
It was a beautiful day.
It's been a great day.
It was a lovely evening.
This behavior was childish on his part.
It was disgusting.
It was effective.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was one of them.
Yesterday was fun.
He spent the night.
It was getting dark.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
It's nice of you to get Tom such a nice present.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It was not easy for me to admit that I was wrong.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty disgusting.
It has been shown that fleas that live on dogs jump higher than those that live on cats.
It was magnificent.
That was pretty funny.
It was really cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
That was really sweet.
That was really touching.
He was blowing a lot.
It was amazing.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go hiking.
It was so obvious.
It was creepy.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that's hanging on the chimney.
It was Tom.
It was too little.
It was sad.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was inconceivable.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
It was very stuffy in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was Better.
It was worth a try.
It was your fault.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be enough.
I'm not gonna be lonely here.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
It won't help the lies.
That's not gonna help you.
It's working fine.
It would be very normal to be angry with Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you tomorrow if I catch you explaining everything.
I need you urgently.
I used to hear you.
I used to dream of being a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I've already packed.
I've already read it.
I have already written everything that needs to be written.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always made sure I didn't say too much.
I've always had someone to help me.
I always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to do something like this.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I've already asked everyone.
I asked Tom to help you.
I baked her a cake.
I baked them a cake.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I was a little overwhelmed with something else.
I've turned the whole town around looking for a home.
I've been through a lot worse.
I've been betrayed.
I've been briefed.
I've been robbed three times this month.
I've been calling for hours.
I was careless.
I was reckless.
I can't wait to meet him.
I've been gone three weeks.
I was happy here.
I was helping her.
I was helping them.
