Wales Assembly Members Concerned About ‘Associating With Muppets’
Some people are horrified by the recommendation to change the name of their post to “Member of the Parliament of Wales” (MWP).
This recommendation came about because of plans to change the name of the assembly to "Parliament of Wales".
The entire political spectrum is concerned that this may provoke ridicule.
One Labour MP said his group was troubled by rhymes with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "unthinkable" and "pwp" means act of defecation.
The Wales Party's CA said its group as a whole was "not satisfied" and offered alternatives.
One of the Welsh conservatives said his group was "unbiased" about the name change, but noted that MWP could quickly become a "mappet".
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is similar to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to change the names, noted: “The final decision on the new name of the Assembly members will certainly be taken by the members themselves.”
The Welsh Self-Government Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public discussion of the proposals, and the renaming of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales received widespread support.
As for what to call the CA, the commission proposes to call them “members of the Welsh Parliament”, i.e. the WMP, but the MWP variant received the most public support.
Of course, the CAs offer alternatives, but trying to reach an agreement could cause problems for the presiding Elin Jones, who is due to submit a bill on changes within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the rules for the suspension of the CA and the structure of the committee system.
They will hold a final vote on their new name when they discuss the legislation.
Macedonians go to vote on the referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote was organized to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to Greek territory, and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes holding a referendum on changing the name, said he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are silent, because the churches of Harlem are going through difficult times
“Old people I’ve talked to say that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
There is no one or the other.”
He believes that the disappearance of bars can be understood:
“People socialize differently these days.
Bars are no longer the kind of local living room they regularly go to.”
As for churches, Adams fears that money from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders hope, and “sooner or later they will be where they started.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by condominium houses, and people would live there who would not help the shrines that remained nearby.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these homes will be white, so it will speed up the day when all these churches close, because it is unlikely that most of those who move to condominiums will become their parishioners.”
Both churches were built by white communities even before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and Saint-Martin ten years later.
The indigenous white Methodist community left in the 1930s.
The black community, which held rites nearby, received ownership of the building.
St. Martin moved to the black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street. These merchants did not want to hire blacks and promote them on the job.
In 1939, a fire severely damaged the building, but the parishioners of Father Johnson wanted to restore it and installed a carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, the son and successor of Father Johnson at Saint-Martin, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor".
An expert who played the carillon in July called it a “cultural treasure” and an “indispensable historical instrument.”
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first carillon in the world, played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who 18 years ago moved to a larger carillon at Riverside Church.
According to Mr. Merriwezer, he was not replaced in St. Maarten.
What has been happening in Saint-Martin over the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some of whom have been involved by church leaders, others by the episcopal diocese.
The council — the governing body of the parish, which is made up of lay leaders — wrote to the diocese in July that it was concerned that the diocese would “try to pass on the costs” to the council, even though the council did not engage in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the eparchy.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobsters in California
According to officials, on Saturday the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him. The boy was diving for lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the lobster season.
The attack took place at about 7 a.m. near the beach of Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help and had sailed with the group to get him out of the water.
At first, Hammel thought it was just a delight about the caught lobster, but then realized that the boy was shouting: “I was bitten!
I have been bitten!”
As soon as he reached the boy, he saw that his collarbone was completely torn.
“I shouted to everyone to come out of the water: ‘In the water is a shark!’” he said.
The boy was taken by helicopter to Children's Hospital Rada in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles told a media briefing that a few weeks ago a shark was spotted in the area, but it was found not to be a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim sustained traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
For safety and security reasons, authorities closed access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto beach in Casablado to Swami in Encinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is going to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with the help of islands with cosmetics similar to those available in department stores. Qualified sellers will work on the islands.
As part of the increased entry into the UK cosmetics market worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion (continues to grow at a time when the volume of sales of clothing and household goods is declining), the increased islands with cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores across the country. Next year, if the idea turns out to be successful, the islands will appear in other stores.
The investment in cosmetics is due to the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelf space that was previously used for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its range of cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will get more space: there will be brand zones similar to those that are available in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also updating the range of Boutique cosmetics: now most of the presented products will not be tested on animals, which is increasingly demanded by young buyers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop is testing its trays at two Sainsbury’s stores: the first tray opened in Croydon, North London, last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and the transition to buying small amounts of food every day in small stores forces supermarkets to make additional efforts to attract visitors.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said their stores will become more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to counter the Aldi and Lidl discounters with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's is opening Argos branches in hundreds of its stores, and a number of Habitats departments have also opened. Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and claim that this has increased food sales, as well as made both networks more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to update the departments of cosmetics and pharmaceutical products ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested the partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute over how to split pharmacy revenues in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmacy business (281 pharmacies) to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s commercial director, said: “We have changed the look of our cosmetics islands to make the atmosphere more pleasant for customers.
We have also invested in specially trained consultants who will be able to give advice.
The range of brands we present is designed to meet any needs, and the pleasant environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which competes with the old way of buying.”
Peter Jones ‘insane’ after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
‘Dragon’s Lair’ star Peter Jones is ‘crazy’ after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of a deal with his <0xC2><0xA3>11m brand of lifestyle goods to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn’t have time for the Truly homewear and accessories brand.
The couple's business was linked to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of the program This Morning announced his retirement on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby drove the star of Peter Jones’ “Dragon’s Den” to a frenzy when, at the last minute, she walked out of their lucrative life goods business to focus on new lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was “crazy” when a golden girl on TV confessed during a tense meeting Tuesday at Jones’s business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million deal means she no longer has enough time to devote to his shared brand of clothes.
This business was associated with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and was to double the fortune of Willoughby, which is estimated at 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the UK to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's top priority.
It was to become its long-term future for the next few decades.
Willoughby’s decision to leave the business stunned all interested parties.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, almost on the eve of the launch.
The headquarters in Marlowe is a full warehouse of things ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, which is one of the highest paid stars of the UK, could cost the firm millions due to large investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothes and home clothes) and create further delays with the launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Kapp, for ten years.
Willoughby and Kapp formed Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple spent holidays together, Jones owns 40 percent of the company Baldwin, which is engaged in television production.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and replace Anthony McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his case.”
Tough conversation, “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for what some would consider a “non-presidential” comment, as well as for his very positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
“Why did President Trump make such a big deal?”
Trump said, imitating the voice of the news anchor.
I didn’t take any action.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have come to a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a “responsive response” from the United States to its first steps toward disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Speaking at his rally, Trump was much more optimistic.
“We have a good relationship with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We have such a great relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the remains of U.S. service members home.
He also defended his unusual approach when talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act presidential, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this beat-up stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
In particular, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok was affected, a national catastrophe was not declared, and this is a prerequisite for receiving international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is somewhat difficult,” Ms. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign personnel will be able to work locally.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether to allow international organisations to provide assistance.
Given the fact that earthquakes are constantly occurring in Indonesia, the country remains terribly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh province, but they are not typical for other coasts.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was valid, likely contributed to the deaths.
To move between the many Indonesian islands is not just in the best of times.
Natural disasters further complicate the logistics.
The medical ship, which was in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake, is sailing to Palu, but will be able to reach the site of the new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo made improvements to Indonesia's infrastructure the basis of his election campaign and increased spending on roads and railways.
But the funding deficit has created problems for the administration of Mr. Joko, who plans to re-elect next year.
Mr. Joko is also hampered by continued sectarian strife in parts of Indonesia where members of the Muslim majority have chosen a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have died and tens of thousands have been evicted from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs clash on the streets using machetes, bows, arrows and other primitive weapons.
Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scores a goal from the depth of the field and equalizes the score with Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League with his 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Jerdan Shachiri, when he was about 27 meters from the Chelsea goal. At this point, his team lost with a score of 1-0.
He tossed the ball to his left leg and charged it in the direction of the far bar.
The ball flew high above the penalty area in the direction of the upper right corner of the gate.
He flew over the jumping Capa Arrisabalaga and fell into the gate.
“It was just an attempt to take that position so as not to waste time. Players like Shachiri always attack as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, and I made one touch, I didn’t think about it too much and just took the ball.
Chelsea led with a score of 1-0 after the first half, in which the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The blue striker handed the pass back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, swung around the middle of the field and quickly ran to half of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> quickly played into the wall in the middle of the field.
Then he made a good penetrating pass, which led Azar to the penalty.
Hazard overtook the defense and made a decisive left-foot strike at the net of the far bar. The ball passed Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 on Wednesday at the stadium “Sao Paulo” in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Death toll from tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the Indonesian disaster relief agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people remained trapped in the rubble of buildings destroyed during Friday's 7.5-magnitude earthquake that caused waves 6 meters high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was littered with debris from destroyed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
The murder investigation began after the woman’s body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Muze, John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called for the response of people who saw or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is now in its early stages, but I ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who could have filmed something on a video recorder, to contact us, as the information on these videos can be very important for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found in the house.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know a woman arrived at the crime scene to ask about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they are currently informing the victim's immediate family.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson-Muse, had just tried to return to his apartment, but police said no one was allowed to enter or leave the house.
When he found out what had happened, he lost the gift of speech.
Residents are now told it will be hours before they are allowed to return home.
Someone overheard a police officer tell a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
At the scene of the crime appeared a woman in tears.
She says, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were behind the fence, and another van was in front of the fence.
Several police officers stood behind the fence and followed the apartment building.
Anyone with information is asked to write a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and call 247 on September 30.
A statue of Cromwell near Parliament becomes a new monument that will suffer from the “rewriting of history”
The removal of the statue would be a well-deserved payback for the Taliban-style destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick’s proposal “foolish” and an “effort to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Community, said: "Given the ongoing debate about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's statue at Westminster Palace would become a target."
Iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars was not carried out either by Cromwell himself or on his orders.
It is likely that Cromwell will be undeservedly sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The majestic statue of Cromwell by sculptor William Hamo Thornecroft is a testament to the mood of the 19th century and part of the historiography of the figure, which, in the opinion of many, is still worth honoring.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many, probably more at the end of the 19th century than now, regard Cromwell as a defender of Parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
Whether such an idea is entirely accurate is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
There is no doubt that the conflict of the mid-17th century determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the famous figures who represents one side of this conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also to be celebrated and honored.”
The killer pig mutilated a Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by his last name Yuan, was found dead in blood with a ruptured artery near a pigsty at a market in Liupangshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
In Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005, a pig farmer is going to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm.
It is reported that on Wednesday, he left with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his brother found him dead and saw that the door of the pigsty was open.
The brother noted that in the pigsty there was a large boar with blood on its mouth.
Forensic examination confirmed that the 249-kilogram wild boar crippled the farmer to death.
“My cousin’s legs were bloodied and deformed,” said Wu’s cousin, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that when police were gathering evidence at the scene, the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking people.
Seven I Yuan and the market administration are reportedly discussing compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of attacks of pigs on people have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and inflicted critical injuries on the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 295 kg kept the Welsh farmer pressed against the tractor until the farmer’s wife frightened the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can become a "trigger".
“They’re just playful.
They're like children, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring extensive rainfall to the south-west of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening, moving over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring rains with floods to northern Mexico and the south-west of the United States.
Rose had a wind speed of 137 km per hour (this is a Category 1 hurricane) as of 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean begins to form a vlog that moves east to the west coast of the United States. When on Monday, Rose approaches the Lower California peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push strong tropical humidity north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 25.4 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Further, in the coming days, tropical humidity, which interacts with the approaching basin, will create strong showers in the southwest.
In this area from 2.54 to 10.2 cm of rain will cause dangerous torrential floods, garbage streams and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will lead to an increase in precipitation in some places to 5–7.6 cm per hour, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5–10.2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in large areas of Arizona.
Torrential floods are possible with a rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
We strongly advise you not to go to the desert on foot, because tropical rains are possible.
Heavy rain can make canyons turbulent rivers, and thunderstorms will bring here gusty winds and dust storms.
The approach of the vagina will cause heavy rains in some parts of the northern coast of California.
The amount of precipitation can exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause weak debris flows and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain in the region in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and Monday morning, and in the evening on Monday and Tuesday the rain will become more extensive.
Heavy rain will go over the "Fore Corners" from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October, there may be intense temperature changes throughout the United States, as the Arctic becomes colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to sharp temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday, you can see a wonderful example of sharp temperature changes in the central part of the United States.
This is a nearly 7-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will try to return and spread again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to be warm by October, with temperatures ranging from the southern plains to parts of the northeast at 27 degrees Celsius.
The temperature in New York City can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees Celsius above the average temperature.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a high probability of exceeding the average temperatures in the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing in the Brett Kavanaugh case
On Thursday, more than 20 million people across six television networks watched the fascinating testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blaise Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
The political standoff continued, with channels interrupting scheduled programming to report Friday’s latest news: an agreement prepared by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct an FBI one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh was groping her drunk and trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his emotional testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched this on Friday, according to research company Nielsen.
The company counted the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
It was not immediately possible to get figures on other networks that also showed the hearings, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has problems measuring the number of people watching TV in offices.
For comparison, such an audience is similar in size to an audience watching a playoff series match or an Oscar award.
The Fox News Channel, whose thought-show hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, was the leader among all channels during a full-day hearing, with an average audience of 5.69 million, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake became a central figure in Friday's drama.
The office of this moderate Republican published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh. After that, on Friday morning, CNN and CBS cameras recorded how protesters shouted at Flake when he tried to take the elevator to the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes, during which he was scolded, which was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” one woman said.
Do you think he's telling the truth?
He was told, “You have power, and many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and added that it would say more at the committee hearing before the elevator closed.
All cable and broadcast channels broadcast live hours later, when the Judicial Committee had to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate.
Flake said he would only do so if he knew the FBI would consider the charges against the candidate next week, a move demanded by the Democratic minority.
Flack was partially persuaded by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After a conversation with Koons, and then with several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice had an impact, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to nominate Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of ‘playing politics’ over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “playing politics” with the UK’s future and undermining national interests.
On 29 September 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK.
In another interview, which came out alongside Theresa May’s front-page interview, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson criticised her so-called Checkers Brexit plan, saying it was “absolutely absurd” to offer Britain and the EU to levy duties on each other.
Who shot Wade Sims: the police arrested Dayton Simpson on suspicion of the death of a player of the University of Louisiana
Police arrested the suspect in the shooting, which led to the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the University of Louisiana.
20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and sent to prison on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities released a video of the dispute between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to the affiliate CBS channel WAFB, the police removed the glasses from the scene of the crime and noted that they found the DNA of Simpson.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wade.
According to the lawyer, he was assigned a bail of $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge coroner’s office released a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department expresses its gratitude to the Louisiana State Police's Special Branch for locating fugitives, the state's criminal police laboratory, the Southern University Police Department, and local citizens for assisting in the investigation that facilitated the arrest.
Louisiana State University sports director Joe Allew thanked local law enforcement for their “carefulness and commitment to justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the University of Louisiana.
Last season, his average score was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, University of Louisiana basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“That’s what bothers you all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano throws ash at Mexico City
The ash emitted by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern regions of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday urged Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, as activity began in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center monitored numerous noises and tremors.
The photo on social media shows thin layers of ash on the windshield of cars on the outskirts of Mexico City, such as Hochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano, located at a distance of 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, after an earthquake with a force of 7.1 points in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with a special police unit. Thousands of people joined protests to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote on secession.
A masked pro-separatist group held back by special forces threw eggs and powdered paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
Clashes took place later in the day, the police used sticks to deter aggression.
A few hours later, groups of independence supporters chanting “We will not forget, we will not forgive!” clashed with supporters of the preservation of the country, shouting: “Long live Spain!”.
According to the local press, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which was declared illegal by Madrid but marked by Catalan separatists, tensions in the region, which seeks independence, remain high.
Voters overwhelmingly chose to vote for independence, but turnout was low, as the majority of those opposed to the secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year as police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region.
Independence groups spent Friday night in tents to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcisse Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia gaining independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I watched my parents cry for the joy of being able to vote, but now we are at a dead end,” he said.
Despite a vital but very difficult victory in last December’s regional elections, the pro-independence Catalan parties have not been able to keep up the momentum this year, with many of their best-known leaders in voluntary exile or prison awaiting trial for their participation in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed a protest in support of police on the phone, said the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is increasing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“The candidate status in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after the car drove into the house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car drove into a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident occurred at Ballinagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 British Standard Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Bloomings noted that the gate and the house itself were damaged.
It is possible that at some point the car was shot from a crossbow.
Menga’s blow secured Livingston victory over the Rangers with a score of 1-0
The first goal of Dolly Menga in the composition of Livingston was victorious
Elevated in the Livingston class stunned the Rangers and brought Steven Gerrard a second defeat of 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
The blow of Dolly Menga was decisive: the team of Gary Holt in a second rose to one level with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's team has not won a single away win in the Premier League this season and will play next Sunday with the leaders of the "Harts", from which it is eight points behind.
Before that, on Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the framework of the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues its undefeated run to six games in the division, and head coach Holt has yet to be defeated after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses out on the opportunities that uninitiated guests provide.
Holt's team should have been ahead of them long before they scored, as their straightforwardness created all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but struck along the gate, then Alan Lithgow punched past the gate after squeezing and taking a shot of Craig Halkett along the gate, which he made with his head.
The hosts were pleased that they allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, while they knew that they could cause problems to guests from standard positions.
And so the decisive goal was scored.
The Rangers missed the free kick, and Livingston made the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson involved Mengu, who took the ball and scored from the center of the penalty area.
By this stage, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but the defense of the field owners was impenetrable for them and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly not disturbed.
This trend continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to strike in the direction of Kelly.
Scott Pittman's kick bounced off Rangers goalie Allan McGregor. Lithgow struck past the goal in another standard Livingston combination.
The awnings were constantly flown into Livingston's penalty box and were constantly neutralized, and two penalty shoot-out bids — after Halkett's attack on Glenn Middleton, who came on as a substitute, and for the hand game — were rejected.
The phenomenon of "Livingston": analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and the result of Livingston.
All-to-one played well, they continued to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and composition has remained virtually unchanged since their return to the top level, but it is fitting to pay tribute to Holt for the way he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett played grandiosely, very well organized defense, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to be constantly on guard.
The Rangers, however, were uninspired.
Previously, they played very well under the leadership of Gerrard, but now do not significantly reach those standards.
They lacked the last ball – only once they broke through the defense of the field owners – and it was something like an awakening for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an was accepted in Cologne.
On Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, smiles and a blue sky were visible.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
There have been some disputes between them over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, the police did not allow 25,000 people to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters of the president still appeared nearby to see it.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, have also made themselves heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
Bilateral protests show the ambiguity of the guest, whom some German Turks called a hero, and others a dictator.
Road accident in Depford: cyclist killed in a collision with a car
The cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street on a busy road in the Deptford area in the southeast of the city at about 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics arrived at the scene, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred a few months after another cyclist died after the driver fled from the scene on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from the accident on Saturday.
London police said they were working to identify the man to inform his next of kin.
Travel is prohibited and bus routes have been changed, motorists are advised to avoid this zone.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Prisoners Traumatized in Riots
Six prison workers were injured in the unrest in the men's prison of strict regime, the prison administration said.
The riots at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire began at around 09:30 UK Standard Time on Sunday and are still ongoing.
To stop the riots, initiated by eight prisoners and localized in one wing, a special unit "Tornado" was called.
Officers were provided with medical care in connection with light facial injuries received at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially trained prison staff have been brought in to deal with the ongoing incident at Her Majesty’s Long-Lartin Prison.
Six employees received medical care in connection with the injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and their time behind bars may be extended.”
In the prison of Her Majesty Long-Lartin more than 500 prisoners, among which the most dangerous offenders of the country.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was sent to hospital after the attack of the prisoner.
In October last year, a special police unit was summoned to the prison to stop serious riots, during which prisoners were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with torrential flooding (dry areas may benefit)
Tropical depression rarely strikes Arizona, but that's exactly what could happen early next week, as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa flow through the southwest of the desert, creating the risk of torrential flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings Monday and Tuesday in areas from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to go straight through the Phoenix on Tuesday, and it will rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles (322 km) of the Phoenix since 1950.
and Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) of the Arizona border.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Hurricane Center, in the Mogollon-Rome area in Arizona, it is expected from 5.08 to 10.16 cm, and in some places up to 15.24 cm of precipitation.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive between 2.54 and 5.08 cm of rainfall, sometimes as much as 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of torrential flooding, Rose rain can be a blessing as the region suffers from drought.
While flooding is a very serious problem, some of these downpours are likely to be beneficial as the southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40 percent of Arizona’s territory suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category of drought, according to weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to landslides on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rose, still in a hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 19.3 km per hour.
The storm meets cooler water in the Pacific Ocean and is therefore weakened.
Thus, it is expected that with the force of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening of Monday, the hurricane will cause a shift in Mexico.
The amount of rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be significant, which creates a significant risk of flooding.
“It is expected that the total amount of precipitation from Lower California to northwestern Sonora will be from 7.62 to 15.24 cm, in some places perhaps up to 25.4 cm,” — said weather.com.
Rose will then go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression, which will then go through Arizona, and reach southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main danger that is expected from Rosa or her remains is very heavy rains in Lower California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern American desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life-threatening torrential floods and debris flows in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four men arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy with knife wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at around 4 a.m. British Standard Time on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he remains in stable condition.
The 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
The police are asking to respond to anyone who may have any video of these events on the phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh “tolerated the ignominy and anger” of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “tolerated the vileness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, frantically and emotionally denying allegations by Christine Blaise Ford that he sexually abused her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about the charges she had brought.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, "the American people saw the brilliance, character and courage" of Kavanaugh.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for one of the most accomplished lawyers of our time, a lawyer with impeccable public service experience,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president briefly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“In five weeks, we will have one of the most important elections of our lives.
“I’m not running, but I’m really running,” he said.
That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump said the Democrats’ mission was to “oppose and obstruct.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, an aide to one of the Republican leaders told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of victims is growing
At least 384 people have died, many washed into the ocean as giant waves hit the beach as a result of an intense earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were resting at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters (18 feet) high crashed into the shore in the twilight, knocking many to death and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat hit yesterday, people were still doing their jobs on the beach and didn’t immediately start running away, and they became victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), at a briefing in Jakarta.
“It was not just a tsunami, it was moving cars, trees, houses, it hit everything that was on land,” Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the coastline, the tsunami passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph).
To escape the tsunami, some people climbed trees and survived, he added.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Disaster Management Agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges turned upside down and destroyed, and the mosque is surrounded by water.
Riots in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in the area, which is home to 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday’s powerful earthquake was 200 times more than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could contribute to the strength of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho called the damage “widespread” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found under the rubble of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater than 300km (190 miles) along the coastline north of Palu in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the quake's epicenter.
“Communications lines were completely damaged and we did not receive any information” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers had moved to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can become much bigger,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received widespread criticism for not reporting that a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves came at the time indicated in the warning.
Amateur footage, which people shared on social networks, shows how a man on the upper floor of the house shouts crazy warnings about the approaching tsunami to people on the street under the building.
A few minutes later, a wall of water crashed into the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a severe power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated people are still in dire need of food and other necessities.
The city’s airport is only open for assistance, and it will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
That's very bad.
World Vision workers from Donggala safely reached the city of Palu, where they hide in tarpaulin awnings installed in the courtyard of their office, but on the way they saw scenes of devastation, Mr Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
That's very bad.
Even as aid groups began taking decisive action to deal with the aftermath of the disaster, some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive experience were not allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian rules, the financing, supply and provision of personnel from abroad can only begin if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Auliya Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, “Okay, this is a national disaster,” we will be able to accept international assistance, but this status has not yet been granted.”
The second night descended on Palu after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, and the friends and families of those who have not yet been found, still hoped that the appearance of their loved ones will be a miracle that will decorate these gloomy stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers picked up a woman who had been lying under rocks for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders to participate in the Asian Games, which were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paragliders trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Hendon recounts how, hours after news of the destruction of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the paragliding community, he was desperate to send WhatsApp messages to Palu’s rivals who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one gray checkmark, not double blue checkmarks.
“I think that means the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves took $26,750 during ATM replenishment at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who operated an ATM at Newport on the Levee, the Newport Police Department said in a news release.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to add more money, wrote detective Dennis McCarthy in the news.
While he was busy, another man "came up behind the Brink employee" and stole a bag of money intended for replenishment.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene of the crime, the newspaper said, but police did not indicate the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone with information about these individuals should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to E
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to E.
On Saturday, announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: “Formerly officially known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West was briefly called E, and he used this abbreviation as the title for his album, released in June.
The change came on the eve of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
At the show, he replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation due to "emotional reasons", the author of the show said.
This is not only a contraction of the current professional name, West previously said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I believe that ‘is’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, I am we, this is us.
Kanye, which means “the only one,” has been shortened to simply E — it’s just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is one of several rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Daddy and Daddy, announced this year that he had chosen the name Love and Brother Love.
West's former colleague, Jay-Z, also experimented with hyphens and capital letters.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vows not to use military against civilians
The newly elected President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use the army against civilians. Soon the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the bloody massacre of students.
On Saturday, L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador vowed in Tlatelolco Square to “never use the army to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the military shelled a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing about 300 people. At that time, leftist student movements began to be established throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He noted that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education lead young people to criminal groups.
U.S. Should Double Funding for Artificial Intelligence
As China ramps up AI activity, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on AI research, according to AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were made after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about AI, although the U.S. has no formal AI strategy at all.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to become the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“A double AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S., and we are preparing for the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next big AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book, “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order,” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in Face++, one of China’s most prominent AI companies.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the best American player at Othello, and later was executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee noted previous technology competitions conducted by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Defense Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and asked when there would be next to help identify the next promising participants.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking away academic leaders, it’s corporations,” he said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring university luminaries to work on AI in recent years.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy can also help the US to increase its efforts in the field of AI.
“I believe that the Green Card should be automatically offered to candidates of science in the field of AI,” he said.
The State Council of China published its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to individuals working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other U.S. government organizations give money to American researchers, with the quality of academic work in China lower, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to attract partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
As for the National Science Foundation, now it invests more than $ 100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which sought to create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence, has not taken any steps for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country's name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which will resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, says the northern neighbor’s name is a claim on its territory and has vetoed Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments struck a deal based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the deal argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum, and because of the boycott campaign, there are doubts whether the voter turnout will reach the minimum 50%, which will allow the referendum to be considered valid.
The question in the referendum ballot is: “Do you support membership in NATO and the EU on the condition of an agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price Macedonia, one of the countries formed after the breakup of Yugoslavia, should pay for joining bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the country’s future, for Macedonia’s youth, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will support it to make it decisive.
A change of name would require two-thirds of the vote in parliament.
The State Election Commission said no violations had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66% of registered voters threw their ballots in the ballot box.
“I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” said 62-year-old voter G<0xC3><0xB6>ze Tanevski in the capital Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorika and his son Dushko cast their vote in a referendum on changing the country’s name, paving the way for joining NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and put chairs in front of tents organized by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with our head held high, not through the service door,” Kavardarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev believes that NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority will vote in favor, since more than 80% of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He noted that the result of “yes” will be a confirmation of their future.
According to a poll published last Monday by the Institute for Political Studies of Macedonia, 30 to 43% of voters will take part in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian TV channel Telma, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote for it.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat in the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it began its work in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City passes the entire defense of Brighton and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling passed Brighton's defence and brought Manchester City a 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The goal of Aguero in the 65th minute of the match looked ridiculously simple.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between the three defenders of Brighton and found himself in the open field.
Then Aguero realized that he was surrounded by four green.
He overtook one defender, then overtook several more at the edge of Brighton penalty area.
Then he made a pass to the left, seeing Sterling.
The English forward made the first touch on the penalty box to give the ball to Aguero, who with his right boot launched it into the right side of the gate, defeating Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
“Aguero has some problems with his legs,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We agreed that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that point.”
But the initial advantage of sky-blue in this match of the Premier League provided Sterling.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in Brighton.
He sent a beautiful penetrating pass along the left flank of Leroy Sane.
Leroy made a few touches and then made a pass of Sterling in the direction of the far bar.
The forward of the sky-blue threw the ball into the goal just before he slipped outside.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhine Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Chertser wants to take points in the "Rocky"
Since the team "Washington Nationals" came out of the playoffs, there was no significant reason to wait for the next start.
But competitive Sherzer hopes to take the pitcher's hill on Sunday in a match against the Colorado Rockies, provided that the Rockies will still have difficulties in reaching the playoffs. Now the Rockies are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of the West.
The Rockies at least have a wildcard for a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to secure the first division title.
“Even though we’re playing for nothing, at least we’ll be able to leave the ball knowing how the spectators are behaving here in Denver and the other team will probably play at the highest level I’ve seen all year.
Why would I not want to participate in this contest?
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be the starting pitcher on Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to think it will be Scherzer.
Sherzer, for whom it will be the 34th start, on Thursday left the pitching session and can play on Sunday, his usual weekend.
The Washington right has a score of 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's rally in West Virginia
The president briefly recalled the situation around his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican supporters in the midterm elections.
“Everything we have done will be at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important choices of our lives will take place.
“It’s one of the big, big ones — I don’t run, but I do run, so I fight for great candidates wherever I can,” he said.
“You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see this happening right now.
And they are firmly committed to regaining power, using any means, you see meanness, filth.
They don’t care who suffers from them, who needs to be stepped over to gain power and control, they want power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
The mission of the Democrats, in his words, is “to resist and hinder.”
“And you’ve seen it over the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “evil and vile, vile and lying.”
He mentioned the Senate Judiciary Committee, naming Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, which provoked an audience to loud cries of discontent.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you provide a document?
Uh-huh.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting — it was really bad body language — the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant to those who express their opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last of those Labour Members of Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome, and all because we are expressing our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated almost in the same way because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was convicted of disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. These issues are ironically similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
A statement from the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
Most of the General Committee's Friday evening meetings in my eight years as a local Labour Member of Parliament were just that.
Unfortunately, today many meetings have a completely different tone, and the promise of a “more friendly, softer” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever began to be implemented.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party is not allowed to have different views and that every opinion is judged from the standpoint of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader. Colleagues with whom I previously thought I had similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and take positions that I would never agree with, be it national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public — and it doesn’t matter what I say — it’s followed by a tirade of social media attacks calling for a recall, condemning the center’s policies, telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it’s not just my experience.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments sent to me are usually political.
I am delighted with the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face daily flows of sexist or racist attacks, but are never silenced.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this political era is that levels of abuse have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a broad church, and with every movement of “mistrust” or change in the rules of selection, the party narrows down.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice. I have been urged not to stand out, not to speak out so loudly, so that with me “everything was fine.”
That’s not why I went into politics.
I joined Labour 32 years ago as a schoolboy because the Thatcher government was not paying attention to my high school class, and since then I have been working to improve the quality of public services for those who need them most, whether they be local councilors or government ministers.
I have never hidden my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East was embarrassed by my political views and disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who contributed to Friday’s events, I want to say only one thing: as the country moves towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
In fact, I have one more message, but not for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, as members of the Labour Party, no: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of recalling me and no political gain will prevent me from acting in accordance with what I consider to be the best interests of all.

"Air" 38 - 17 "Melrose": undefeated "Air" rise up
The last two attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but without a doubt, Air deserved a triumph in today's wonderful entertainment match of the Scottish Premier League.
Now they are leading the table, this is the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, the excellent defense and improved ability to use the chances gives the hosts and coach Peter Merci every right to be satisfied.
“So far we have been tested by our games and we are still undefeated, so I have to be satisfied,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose commented, "I give the Air credit, they took better chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, realized by Frazier Klimo, brought Air forward, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, issued by the Verriors, allowed Melrose to show the numbers, and Jason Baggott used an unrealized attempt.
Klimo strengthened the leadership of "Air" with a penalty kick and just before the break made and implemented a solo attempt, which gave the score 17-5 in favor of "Air"
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt by Baggot narrowed the gap to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, who was taken out of the field on stretchers, and from the restart "Air" broke forward with the help of an attempt by Stafford McDowell, which was implemented by Klimo.
Air captain Blair McPherson then had a yellow card, and once again Melrose forced another player to pay an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin under fierce pressure.
The hosts returned, but when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Klimo without the ball from the penalty area line, McPherson made a touchdown behind the Ayr Mall.
Klimo made an attempt, which he did almost every time after the restart, after which Kyle Rowe received a punch in the box from David Armstrong and sent flanker Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the home team.
It seems that the star of the series "Still Game" is set for a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that the star of the series “Still Game” Ford Kiran is set for a new career in the field of hospitality. Such a conclusion can be made after it became known that he is the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC television series, the script for which he writes and in which he starred with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemfill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kirnan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun hinted that Kirnan wanted to enter Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business".
"Our Sea": the inland Bolivia hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the equipped fleet headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings hang an ocean-blue flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the motto: “Our sea is right.
We have to bring him back.”
In landlocked Bolivia, there is still a memory of the loss of the coastline that ceded Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century due to natural resources, and there is also a desire to swim again in the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes are now perhaps the strongest in decades, as Bolivia awaits an international court ruling on Oct. 1 after five years of trial.
“There is momentum in Bolivia, there is a spirit of unity and calm, and of course it expects a positive result,” said Roberto Calzádia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the announcement of the ICJ decision on big screens across the country, hoping that a tribunal in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia, which, after decades of fragmented talks, will force Chile to negotiate Bolivia's sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president who faces opposition to his re-election next year, also has high hopes for a decision to be announced on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and if this happens, little will change.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to award Chilean territory and said it would not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the ICJ’s decision, taken only six months after the final arguments were made, indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
The case of Bolivia has not progressed, the last four years could contribute to the rollback.
“The issue of access to the sea has been used by the current Bolivian administration,” Zarate said.
Morales’ bellicose rhetoric undermined the remnants of Chilean benevolence, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but after that it will be very difficult to hold discussions.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, disagreed that the court’s decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to put an end to 139 years of disagreements, benefiting each other,” he said.
Calzádia also denied that Morales — still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
This resolution is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never give up its nuclear weapons first before it can trust Washington.
Ree spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during the summit in Singapore by the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which has stalled more than three months after Singapore’s summit with Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the belief that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration of an end to the Korean War will one day bring North Korea to its knees is “an impossible dream.”
Washington is afraid to accept the declaration before Pyongyang takes significant steps towards disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning its arsenal, which the country probably considers the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
At the Paris fashion shows presented the latest trend of massive hats, which is already heading to the main streets of your city
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely hide from the sun, you have found what you need.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown showcased a range of eccentric oversize hats from the Spring-Summer 2019 collection on the catwalks of Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and named designers have already sent their dizzying creations beyond the podium.
Valentino stood out with an extravagant beige hat with wide fields decorated with feathers, which covered the heads of models.
Among other oversize accessories are decorated with precious stones watermelons, a sorcerer's hat and even a pineapple hat, but they are not meant to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated an assortment of original masks – very timely before Halloween.
Many of these multicolored masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One was like scuba gear with a tube and glasses, the other looked like an ice cream cone that had melted.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you are in luck.
Stylists say that huge hats can go out on the main streets of your city.
Oversize hats came into fashion thanks to "La Bombi", a straw hat with fields sixty centimeters wide, which was seen at all: from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind a very impractical hat that could be seen everywhere on social networks gave the world another creation: a straw beach bag almost the size of a model in a swimsuit that wore it.
A bag of yellowish-red raffia with a fringe of raffia and a white leather handle was the central element of the collection of La Riviera spring-summer 2019 by Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “Next summer I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets of cities, because the influence of the designer is so huge that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories.”
John Edward: knowledge of languages is mandatory for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland maintain high standards of teaching, and in 2018 we again received excellent exam results, complemented by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other fields.
These schools, which have more than 30,000 students across Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCBS), which strives to provide the best level of service for students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and to make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject to choose from in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a person in a language that he understands, he perceives it with his mind.
If you talk to her in her native language, she takes it with her heart.”
It’s a powerful reminder that we can’t just use English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest results of this year's exams, we see that in independent schools, languages are leading in the rankings of subjects with the best grades.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received a higher score of A.
The data collected in 74 SRNS schools showed that 72% of students received a higher A score from Chinese, and another 72% of those who study German, 69% of those who study French, and 63% of those who study Spanish also received an A.
This suggests that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages to be vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Now languages as a subject of choice are taught in the same way as the subjects of STIM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), within the framework of independent school programs and in other institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that 17% of the reasons why employers are unable to close jobs related to language skills shortages.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for a future career.
As more and more promising positions require knowledge of languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if someone has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future, because it is a skill for life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who speaks several languages an advantage over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to support a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of people (15%).
That’s why investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
Knowledge of several languages, especially the languages of developing countries, will provide children with a better chance of finding a full-time job.
In Scotland, each school will study its own language.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important to the UK from a 2020 perspective, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests in independent schools, it will always be possible to choose several languages to study with qualified teachers.
Scottish independent schools are trying to create a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed no matter what the future holds for them.
Now it is undeniable that in the international business environment, languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be considered “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
I'll be honest with you.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron Debuts with the Lakers in San Diego
Fans who want to see the first start of LeBron James for the Los Angeles Lakers, almost waited.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday in his first pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play has not yet been decided.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six games of the Lakers pre-season schedule.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Trump rallies in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign rallies today from Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including rallies in friendly states including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote he proposed to the Supreme Court has been postponed, and Trump is seeking to form support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online below live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to recall the tense hearings this week over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual misconduct, and the Senate postponement of the vote for a week while the FBI’s investigation is ongoing.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain popularity before the November election.
President Trump’s representatives said the five rallies next week were aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to preserve and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control of Congress is so critical to its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season approaches,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
At the planned at the stadium "Vesbanko Arena" in the city of Wheeling, today's rally can come supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the media from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday’s visit will be Trump’s second in a month to West Virginia, a state in which he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate Patrick Morrissey, whose rating lags behind the polls.
“It’s not good for Morrissey that the president is coming to raise his poll rating,” Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team is set to fight and full of hope on the eve of Sunday singles
After three sessions, which ended in a one-sided victory, the afternoon Saturday forsomes could become exactly what this Ryder Cup lacked.
The emergency pendulum of momentum is a completely fictional sports concept that players really believe in, especially in such competitions.
So when will they say that the impulse is working?
“They were six points ahead and now they’re four, so I think we’re taking that a bit of an impulse,” Spite said as he left.
Europe has an advantage, of course, four points ahead and another twelve in the game.
Americans, Spite says, feel a bit of wind in their sails, and there’s a lot to encourage, not least the shape of Spite and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each earned three points out of four.
Spit with his killer punches from tee-stand to green shows an example.
These lapping shouts of celebration became louder as he continued his round by making a decisive pat and leveling the score in the fourth match after he and Thomas were two points behind.
His pat, which allowed them to win the match on the 15th hole, was met with a similar cry, one that tells you that the American team does not give up.
“You really just have to try very hard and worry about your own match,” Spit said.
That’s all any of these players have left now.
18 holes to become famous.
The only players with more points than Spitt and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
An unusual, but charming couple from Europe has four out of four and can not make mistakes.
The Molywoods were the only pair who did not do the boggies on Saturday afternoon, and they also managed to avoid the boggies on Saturday morning and Friday afternoon and at the nine last holes on Friday morning.
This run, and the way their energy seems to flow to this tumultuous crowd and back, makes one believe that they will win on Sunday and that there will be no more popular players except Fleetwood or Molinari to secure a potential European victory when the sun goes down on Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the triumph of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of morning phorbols, when he was paired with Alex Norén.
One boggi and two dabs on the first nine holes led the Spaniard and the Swede to a hole from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the hole.
It is very interesting to observe the forbols and forsomes closely through the interaction between the participants of the pair, through the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and it is also interesting to observe how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe is playing better as a team so far and has a significant last-day advantage, but this force-play session has also shown that the U.S. team intends to fight, which some, especially Americans, doubt.
Europe leads with a score of 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will have a solid advantage, because after Saturday's forbols and forsomes, it is ahead of the United States with a score of 10-6.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, the duo won two victories over the trailing Tiger Woods, and now have four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn’s European team, which is trying to recover the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in morning 3-1.
The U.S. put up more resistance in the forsoms and won two games, but failed to close the gap.
Jim Furik's team needs eight points in 12 Sunday singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and Mollinari (along with Mollinari) are only the second pair to score four points in the first four games in Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend.
Having smashed Woods and Patrick Reed in the scoreboards, they teamed up to defeat the bloated Woods and rookie American Bryson Deschamps with an even more spectacular 5ta4.
Woods, who pulled out two games on Saturday, has shown occasional flashes of genius, but he has so far lost 19 of his 29 games in forbols and forsomes and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not take part in the morning forbols, returned to partner Henrik Stanson in forcems to get a 2-1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are the first and third in the world ranking.
Europe has not been able to do everything in its own way on this pleasant fresh day southwest of Paris.
Three times the main winner Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas on Saturday set the standard for Americans with their two points.
They won a decisive 2-1 victory over the Spaniards John Ram and Ian Poulter in the overballs and later defeated Poulter and Rory McLroy with a 4-3 score in the forsoms, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has the team returned with a four-point deficit in singles, although Furik's team needs only a draw to keep the trophy.
However, after the second place for two days, the counterattack on Sunday looks like they can not do it.
North Korea says it will not “under any circumstances” disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the extension of sanctions deepens mistrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country will never be able to give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken “substantial goodwill measures” last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and pledging not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we will in no way be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
And while Ree echoed North Korea’s familiar complaints about Washington’s opposition to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea would be rewarded for incremental steps, his statement turned out to be important in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ree referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called for work to “denuclearize the Korean Peninsula” and Trump promised security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea seeks a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington is also resisting calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and raises the pressure level with sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even objects to ‘declaring an end to the war,’” he said.
“To believe that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an impossible dream for those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ree did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If South Korea, rather than the United States, were on the side of denuclearization, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a dead end.”
Despite this, the tone of Ree’s speech was sharply different from last year when he told the General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s missiles on the U.S. mainland was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocket man” who wanted to commit suicide.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said much more needed to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea’s denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump noted that he does not set a time frame for this: “It will take two years, three years or five months — it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and unswervingly until we see complete, final, verifiable denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear programs and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Pyongyang in July and commented that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea convicted him of "gangster demands".
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle the missile system as well as the nuclear complex if the United States took “appropriate measures.”
He said that, according to Kim, he needed “appropriate measures” are the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore, and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has provided all of its students with more sleep. This is an attempt to combat the growing culture of the steepness of learning all night long after refilling with caffeine.
The lecturer found that the number one university students in the world are often uneducated when it comes to the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women’s Hospital, has developed what he believes is the first such course in the U.S.
He decided to start the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end, a girl came up to him and said, “Why am I being told this now, in my final year?”
“She told me that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” the teacher told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help achieve academic and athletic outcomes, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s medical services, said the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students were severely sleep deprived for a week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a dorm room where students click cups of coffee, curtains, exercise machines, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the effects of sleep deprivation on athletic performance, and the importance of a sleep-related routine.
In another section, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Further, the campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know it won’t change students’ behavior instantly.
But we believe that they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” added Professor Cheisler.
A culture of pride in “sleepless nights” still exists, he added, and noted that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is growing.
Getting enough good quality sleep should be a student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, even with weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, causing constant physical hunger, he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheysler design the course after enrolling in one of his other courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to appeal to all graduate students with a request to undergo a similar training program before coming to a competitive institution.
Professor Chaisler recommends that students set a reminder to go to bed, set an alarm, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light, which is emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps and can disrupt the circadian rhythm, leading to problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal upset the guys Gerrard
The Rangers survived another attack of away sadness: Dolly Menga's blow brought the disparate team of Stephen Gerrard a defeat with a score of 1-0 from Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first away match after the February triumph over St. Johnstone with a score of 4-1, but the team of Gary Holt gave Gerrard a second defeat as a manager of 18 games. Gerrard's team remained eight points behind the leaders of Scotland.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who lacked inspiration, did not look like they could even the score.
Now the Rangers have dropped to sixth position, and Livingston have risen to third, and by the difference of the balls they are ahead only of Hibernian.
In addition, the "Rangers" may face another nuisance, because the lineman Kalum Spence was forced to treat a head wound after he was thrown from the guest sector in some object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that once passed Air in the Scottish League Cup semi-finals.
And Holt produced the same line-up of Levi 11 that scored one point at Harts last week, and was thrilled with how his extorted boys were squeezing rivals at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but Livingston worked more with the ball.
They were due to score just two minutes into the game when Menga's first free-zone pass allowed Scott Pittman to hit Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder squandered that big chance by sending the ball past the goal.
Deep free kick Keagan Jacobs got a skipper Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow hit the back bar
The Rangers did gain control, but there was more hope in the final third than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should get a penalty kick a quarter of an hour after the clash with Stephen Lawless, but referee Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian's appeal.
The Rangers were only able to score two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goaltender Liam Kelly was almost undisturbed by Lassana Coulibaly's head-butt and Ovie Ejar<0xC3><0xAD>a's calm blow.
And although Livingston's 34-minute goal may have contradicted the game, no one can deny that they deserved it only by their hard work.
The Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs's procurement.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Mengu for a simple finish.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately worked when the winger made his way to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed out of his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to force guests to play exactly the kind of game they liked when Lithgow and Halkett made one long pass after another.
Holt's team could have improved the result in the final stages, but McGregor resisted Jacobs well before Lithgow struck from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a replacement for the Rangers, made another late application for a penalty when confronted by Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our almanac "Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and time goes ... in Germany was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger has become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of pop culture, for example, in the 1950 film Coronado Bells with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play dubious-looking cowboy scientists.
Man: “What is it anyway?”
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter that is used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can really hear how the atoms are affected by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “Well, it’s really cracking now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name, continues to live.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Malignant Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves the removal of immune cells in the patient and their change in the laboratory
These cells are then able to "see" a protein that is common to many types of cancer, and then these cells are reintroduced to the patient.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing the patient's immune cells, changing them in the laboratory so that these cells can "see" a protein common to many types of cancer (HER2), and then re-injecting these cells into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine.”
“HER2 “stimulates the growth of several cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer,” he explained.
A similar approach, which involves removing immune cells from patients and “training” them to target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
After appearing in the studio of the show SNL in a baseball cap MAGA Kanye West blunted with a sharp speech in support of President Trump,
What caused a negative reaction from the audience?
Viewers at the SNL (Saturday Night Live) show booed Kanye after his tumultuous performance, during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing a third song called Ghost Town in a baseball cap that read “Let’s Give America Back to Its Former Glory,” he exploded with a tirade in which he criticized Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Often during a conversation, white people ask me, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist.’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show began with a sketch by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the case of Christine Blaise Ford's sexual assault lawsuit.
Although West's speech was not broadcast live, a video of his tirade was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It remains unclear whether Rock wanted to make fun of West by posting this post.
West also complained to the audience that behind the scenes with him there was an unpleasant situation because of the headdress.
As reported by the Washington Examiner, West said: "When I was behind the scenes, I was rude.
I was told, “Don’t go out to the audience in this baseball cap.”
They mocked me!
And then I’m told that I’m in a place where the oppressed are silent.”
West continued, "Do you want to see a place where the oppressed are silent? I'll put on my Superman baseball cap, because that way no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to keep moving forward?
Then try to treat each other with love.”
As reported by the weekly Variety, his comments at least twice caused a negative reaction of the audience in the hall, and the actors of the SNL show looked confused. One of the viewers said this: "There was a dead silence in the studio."
Vesta was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days before the broadcast.
West surprised many by performing the song "I Love It" in a Perrier water bottle costume.
Vesta was supported by the head of the conservative organization TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "One of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR THAT STANDING AGAINST NATO".
Instead, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "is who he is, and that's just great."
“But I will NOT reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’) who, in my opinion, professes and rejects an ideology that harms my community.
He is a free man.
Just like us,” she added.
Before performing on the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name: now he is "the one who was previously known as Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name; he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and Pi Daddy.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was formerly known as Snoop Lyon, and music legend of recent decades Prince changed the name to a symbol and later became "The Artist Formerly Known as Prince".

Game of Thrones star Keith Gherington condemns the idealization of brutality
Keith Gherington became famous for his role as the sword warrior John Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones" produced by HBO.
However, the 31-year-old actor spoke out condemning the stereotype of the macho hero, arguing that because of such heroes on the screens, young guys often think that they must become cool so that they are respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said that, in his opinion, "something went wrong", and asked how to solve the problem of idealizing brutality in the era of the popularity of the hashtag #MeTo (#yes, #Yatezh, etc.).
The cat, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, said he was “quite determined” to tackle the issue.
"I'm quite determined at the moment. When did we get on the slippery path of idealizing brutality?" he asked.
“Why do we teach future men if we look at their growing up through the lens of the problem we see now?”
Keith believes that television is partly responsible for popularizing brutality through portrayals of extremely courageous heroes.
He continued: “What is natural, and what are we planted?
Why does television and the street teach that young men feel pressure to be such men?
In my opinion, today’s really important question is “How can we change this?”
It is obvious that the young guys have strayed from the right path.”
In an interview, he also noted that he would not appear in any prequels and sequels of Game of Thrones after the show ended next summer, as he was "already done with the fights and the horses".
From November, the cat will play in the production of the play "True West" Sam Shepard - a story about a film producer and his brother-thief.
As the actor recently admitted, he considers the meeting with his wife Rose the best he received from participating in the series “Game of Thrones”.
“During the filming of this series, I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and determined my future life,” said Keith.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played Igritt, the love of the hero of Gherington John Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018. The ceremony was held on the estate of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a sharp increase of 14% in new cases
China reported a sharp increase of 14% in the number of people with HIV and AIDS.
According to the representatives of health authorities, in total there are more than 820,000 patients in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In most cases, the disease was sexually transmitted, which indicates a change in the past trend.
For a long time in some regions of China, HIV spread rapidly through infected blood during transfusions.
However, health officials said during a conference held in Yunnan province, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of HIV and AIDS patients in China increased by 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV over time is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but the LGBT community often suffers from discrimination.
According to studies, 70-90% of men who have sex with other men later marry women because of the dominance of conservative values in the country.
Transmission of the disease in most cases occurs as a result of improper use of protective equipment during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide free access to HIV medicines, seeing this as a partial solution to the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking Republican senators' data to the network by her staffer and slams "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory"
On Saturday, U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters denounced allegations that one of her staffers posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims that these statements are spread by “ultra-right” political observers and websites.
“Lies, lies, and then even more hideous lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
The information reportedly contained the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The data appeared on the network on Thursday. They were posted by an unknown person from the Capitol during a hearing in the Senate Commission on charges of unlawful sexual acts against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the post of judge of the Supreme Court of the United States.
The leak came some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The publication The Hill reported that on such conservative websites as Gateway Pundit and RedState, there was information that the IP address of the source of the leak is associated with the office of Waters and she managed to find the data of her staff member.
“These baseless claims are absolutely false, they are not true,” Waters continued.
“An employee of my office whose personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fabricated and false statements has nothing to do with the leak of this information.
These unsubstantiated statements are absolutely false, they do not correspond to reality.”
Waters' statement was quickly criticized on the network, among others, said former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is full of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that with this character she cannot be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, there is no need to be angry.
The accused should not behave brazenly.
He should not ask about the motives of the one who accuses.
He must remain calm and unmoved."
Fleischer seems to have drawn parallels between Waters’ reaction and the Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of looking too angry during Thursday’s hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted his opinion.
“This is so news if it’s really true,” he wrote.
In a statement, Waters said her office had already notified “relevant state and law enforcement agencies of these false statements.”
“We will do everything we can to find those responsible,” she continued, “and they have been held accountable before the law for their actions, which are harmful and dangerous to all of my employees.”
“Agent Johnny English: A New Mission” is a parody of the spy thriller with Rowan Atkinson.
It has already become a good tradition to look for Brexit-inspired meanings in every new British film. There are also meanings in the new part of the series of comedic parodies of Johnny English fighters. The first film called "Johnny English" was released back in 2003, later the series was renewed in 2011, filming "Johnny English: The Beginning of the End".
Will a mockingly ironic self-sacrifice for what we are unworthy become the nation’s new export potential?
One way or another, Johnny English, with his face moving and his eyes bulging, was given the opportunity to make a mess for the second time, with his name more than anything else indicating that this comic character was created for viewers in non-English-speaking countries.
As you know, Johnny is a recklessly cheerful secret agent, in which, despite his strange attempts to be gallant and charming, there is a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean and a lot of things – from the guy who played one note of the melody from the film “Fire chariots” at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
The character’s prototype is also a traveler and an international enigma that has always left a mess that Atkinson once played in a long-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial.
There are a few good moments in the latest Johnny English movie.
I liked the scene when Johnny English in knightly armor was approaching the helicopter, and the blades of the screw were dancin' about his helmet.
The film beautifully reveals Atkinson's talent for buffoonery, but humor is fleeting, and in some moments it is too much, especially when compared with the "serious" film brands, such as "Agent 007" and "Mission Impossible", one of the "ingredients" of which is also a comedy.
It seems that the jokes are aimed at children rather than adults, and to me the senseless misfortunes that occur with Johnny English do not seem as inventive and thoughtful as Atkinson's wits in the silent films about Bean.
As always, the film begins with the fact that the UK is facing a serious threat.
A hacker infiltrates the British super-secret spy network and reveals the names of all field agents, which was a complete surprise for the acting agent (unfortunately, Kevin Eldon played only an episodic role in the film).
This turned out to be the last straw for the Prime Minister – a proud person who has already suffered devastating criticism and is in deep depression due to the loss of popularity (Emma Thompson tried to convey the image inspired by Theresa May, but the script did not allow to fully reveal it).
Advisors from the intelligence service informed her that all active agents were compromised, and she needed to attract someone from the retired.
The choice falls on the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in some super-fashion institution and unofficially teaches children undercover operative work (in this part with the spy "school of the year" English for teenagers was a few good jokes).
English is quickly taken to Whitehall for an urgent briefing, where he reunites with his long-suffering friend Buff, who is once again played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to the captain of a submarine (the role of an exalted annoying person does not quite match the talent of Vicky Pepperdine).
So, when everything in Her Majesty's Secret Service went awry, "Batman and Robin" return to the ranks and unexpectedly meet the fatal woman Ofelia Pistoletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
And at this time, the Prime Minister falls under the spell of a charismatic billionaire who has earned his fortune in the field of technology and claims that he can eliminate the problem with the British network - the evil Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff go on a journey and again resort to their ridiculous tricks at home: disguised as waiters, they make a fire in a chic French restaurant; then they sow chaos, illegally traveling abroad on a luxury Volta yacht; English is happy with a real mess when it comes to taking advantage of the real mess.
All the stops bring us to the last episode, but with its good-naturedness and madness, it somehow resembles a movie for children.
A passing film.
As with other Johnny English films, I asked myself the same question: can the British film industry not offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Labour rejects plan to make British workers work four days a week but get five days' pay
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is set to discuss a radical plan that would see Britons work four days a week but get five days’ pay.
It is reported that the party wants to oblige managers of companies to transfer the funds saved as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence to employees, giving them an additional day off.
Thus, the workers will have a three-day weekend and at the same time bring home the same salary.
According to sources, this idea will correspond to the economic program of the party and will direct the country's resources to support the working class.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved at the British Trade Union Congress. It is seen that in this way workers will be able to benefit from a change in the overall economic situation.
A Labour source told The Sunday Times: “The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
Everything will not change overnight, but the idea of a four-day working week corresponds to the party’s approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party.
Labour was not the first to approve the idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day working week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, not all members of the Labour Party at the moment approve of such a desire.
A Labour spokesman said: “The party’s political programme does not foresee the introduction of a four-day working week, so we are not considering this idea now.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Party’s election convention last week.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the “faceless directors” of utilities and “explorers.”
The “shadow” chancellor’s plan also means that shareholders of water companies may not get their full share of the capital if the Labour government imposes a “deductible” on the basis of alleged violations.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers on company boards and create inclusive equity funds to transfer 10% of the ordinary shares of private sector firms to workers, who are expected to receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk on 60 Minutes about whether the FBI’s Kavanaugh investigation could change their minds.
In connection with the investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, led by the FBI, the final vote on his appointment to the post of judge of the Supreme Court has been postponed for at least a week. The question arises whether the Republican senators will continue to support Kavanaugh after the publication of the results of the investigation bureau.
On Sunday's 60 Minutes, Rep. Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Yes, of course,” Kennedy said.
During the hearing, I said that I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it all happened and the accusation came out, and I asked him, “Did you really do this?”
He was determined, unyielding, uncompromising.”
It seems that Graham's opinion will not change anything.
“I believe that the indictment of Kavanaugh is a provocation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied everything,” Graham added, addressing Christine Blaise Ford.
And anyone she calls can't prove it under oath.
This happened 36 years ago.
I don’t know what can change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how can it reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual event in the music world with a staggering number of star performers and an equally astounding mission to fight poverty around the world.
During the seventh Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will crowd the Great Plains of Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to draw attention to the festival’s true purpose – the organizers aim to overcome extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international non-governmental organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to an event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors must complete a series of tasks or “acts,” such as taking a volunteer project, writing an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or anything else to help draw attention to the organization’s goal of eradicating poverty.
So are there any results already, because the organizers of Global Citizen have 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding an act with a free concert a brilliant way to convince people to take action, or is it just another case of so-called “clictivism” where people feel that they’re really making a difference by signing an e-petition or posting on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have recorded 19 million “deeds” of their supporters, aimed at achieving various goals.
According to the organization, these actions prompted world leaders to announce planned financial allocations and programs worth more than $ 37 billion, which by 2030 will help change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 financial commitments and public statements as an example of its performance, with at least $10 billion already collected and spent.
According to the group, the funds have already directly affected the lives of approximately 649 million people worldwide.
Among the main financial commitments can be mentioned The Power of Nutrition fund, which is territorially related to the UK. As part of the project, investors and implementers have committed to "help children grow up" and promised to provide Rwanda with $ 35 million in aid to overcome the problem of malnutrition after receiving more than 4700 reports from Global Civit.
“With the support of the UK government, philanthropists, governments of other countries, and citizens of the world like you, we can make the social problem of malnutrition an insignificant fact of history,” said Tracy Ullman, a spokeswoman for The Power of Nutrition, speaking to the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organisation also said that after 5,000 “deeds” calling for improved nutrition for mothers and children, the UK government has announced funds for The Power of Nutrition, a project aimed at improving the nutrition of 5 million mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions on their website, "Why do you think you can overcome extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen wrote: “It’s a long and difficult road, so sometimes we fall and fail.
However, like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are just some of the star performers who will perform at this year’s festival in New York, with Deborah-Lee Furness and Guy Jackman as the host.
The interior minister said that the United States could use naval forces to “block” to prevent the export of Russian energy resources.
U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, quoted by the Washington Examiner, said Washington could seek help from the Navy “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy resources from entering markets, including those in the Middle East.
Zinke said that Russia’s involvement in the conflict in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is an occasion to explore new energy markets.
“I think they are in the Middle East because they want to be an intermediary in energy trade, as they are already doing in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
“Thanks to the naval forces, the United States can provide free passage by sea and, if necessary, block them so that Russian energy resources do not enter the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, which was held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that positions itself as the “voice of every consumer” in the United States.
He then compared the approaches to trade with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually similar.
“The economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we effectively use energy resources and replace them with alternative ones,” he said, calling Russia “unilaterally developed” because its economy depends on energy sources of mineral origin.
While these statements were heard, the Trump administration set a goal to increase the export of compressed natural gas to Europe, displacing the energy market of Russian origin, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
To do this, Trump administration officials and President Donald Trump himself are trying to convince the German government to abandon the “unexpedient” project for the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which costs $11 billion and will double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington is fiercely opposed to the project only for economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
“In my opinion, we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and the consumer should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position caused a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
The German industry’s leading organization, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I don’t like it when a third country interferes in our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Association of German Industry, said after German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s last meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren Will 'Seriously Consider' Running for President in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
During a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for president.
According to The Hill, Warren said: “It’s time for women to go to Washington and get the government working, and for that, a woman should be at the helm.”
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider putting forward my candidacy for the presidency.”
During a meeting with the public, Warren expressed her assessment of the presidency of Donald Trump, saying that he "leads his country in the wrong direction.
“I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been outspoken in criticizing Trump and his proposed candidacy for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote: “...undoubtedly, before the vote, the FBI must conduct an investigation.”
However, according to a poll released on Friday, most Warren voters don’t think she should run in 2020.
According to a survey conducted jointly by the University of Suffolk Center for Political Studies and The Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential Massachusetts voters voted against the senator’s nomination.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The results of the survey showed that former Governor Deval Patrick enjoys more support. 38% voted for the potential nomination of him to the post of President, 48% against.
Other prominent Democrats who may run in 2020 are also named former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make a decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin during a rally in support of Donald Trump
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence. The incident occurred on Monday night.
“What my son is going through now, what he is going through after his return, can only be understood by other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and other health problems with which our soldiers are returning home,” she told participants in a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called Trek's arrest "a problem that no one pays attention to" and said her son and other war veterans "are coming home not as they used to be, more brutal, and want to know if they respect what their fellow soldiers, pilots and other servicemen have done for this country."
According to a spokesman for the city’s police department, Dan Bennett, Trek was arrested on Monday in the town of Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as obstructing reports of a violent incident and carrying a gun while intoxicated.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support challenging new U.S. policies that deny refugee status to victims of gang harassment and domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the county sent an analytical note to a court consultant in Washington to support the plaintiff, who needs asylum and appealed the policy in court.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Rights Union, which challenges federal policy and was filed in August, is not disclosed.
The plaintiff said her partner “and his violent bandit sons” had beaten her, but U.S. officials denied her when she asked for asylum on July 20.
She was illegally detained in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace's lawsuit said residents of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (refugees from whom they often seek asylum in the U.S.) often face serious problems such as banditry and domestic violence.
The new refugee policy reverses a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that said undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum.
D.C. Attorney General Carl Reissin said in a speech Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international laws.”
“Federal law requires that decisions on applications for refugee status be based on consideration of the facts and circumstances set out in such a statement, and the prohibition violates this principle,” the court’s consultant said in an analytical note.
Further in the memo, prosecutors argue that policies that bar immigrants from entering the U.S. harm the country’s economy because they could potentially become entrepreneurs and “replenish the necessary labor resources.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June issued an order to immigration judges saying they could no longer grant refugee status to those fleeing domestic violence and banditry.
“Asylum is granted to those individuals who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution due to race, religion, nationality, membership in certain social groups or political views,” Sessions said in a June 11 policy presentation.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescuers are desperately trying to find those who survived, while the death toll in Palu has doubled.
For the survivors, the situation continues to deteriorate.
“The situation is very tense,” says the 35-year-old mother, calming her boy with a fever in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance brings the body.
There is no clean water.”
Some residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up flooded belongings, trying to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake are overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Two Geris with a fractured back and shoulder, rest near the building of the army hospital Palu, where patients are treated in the open air due to constant repeated tremors.
His eyes were filled with tears as he remembered a strong jolt shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I think I was trapped in the rubble of the wall,” Garris told The Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife begging for help, and then there was silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my son.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “exercising psychological pressure” through “advertising containing propaganda”
A week after a state-run Chinese newspaper ran a four-page U.S. daily ad on the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the paid China Daily app in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's most popular newspaper, after accusing China of trying to influence the November 6th congressional elections. China rejects these accusations.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump’s statements, in which he accuses Beijing of trying to interfere in the U.S. election, mark a new phase of escalation by Washington aimed at putting pressure on China.
While foreign governments may be advertising to boost trade, Beijing and Washington are in the midst of an escalating trade war in which they have already raised tariffs on imports.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the introduction of a repressive duty in China was intended to strike at exporters from states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of trump.
Terry Brensted, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had harmed American workers, farmers and companies.
China, as Brensted wrote in the column of the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, “increases the pressure by publishing propaganda ads in our independent press.”
“To spread propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American people’s tradition of freedom of speech and press independence to place paid advertisements on the Des Moines Register,” Brenstedt wrote.
"In contrast, on the street layouts here in Beijing, you will find only individual voices of dissenters. Here you will not see a true reflection of what the Chinese people actually think about the direction of the Chinese economy, which is of concern, from which we can conclude that the Chinese media are under the reliable control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the most respected Chinese publications offered to publish" his article, but did not name which one.
Analysts warn that the failure of Kavanaugh Republicans set against themselves women voters before the midterm elections
As many prominent Republicans back and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh after he was indicted on multiple sexual assault charges, analysts warn that it could spark an unwelcome backlash ahead of upcoming midterm elections, especially for women.
Passions are running high around this situation, and most Republicans publicly declare that they would like to proceed to the vote.
Such things cannot then simply be played back,” Grant Rieger, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an interview published Saturday.
Reeger expressed doubt that the FBI investigation, which Senator Jeff Flake (Republican from Arizona) began to insist at the last minute, would be enough to calm angry voters.
According to Washington, D.C., the chief adviser and spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, Catherine Jean-Perrier, said on Friday: “Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it either tomorrow or in November.”
According to Mic, on Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" during a demonstration in the Legal Committee, when the Republicans decided to proceed to the approval of Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
In an interview with the news website Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political columnist, said: “People will be extremely interested and motivated.”
“They say it’s happening now, and it’s true.
However, motivation may increase, especially among women voters 18-29 years old from the suburbs, who have not yet decided and often do not vote if they do not like the president.
Even before Ford testified in connection with the allegations of a candidate for the post of Supreme Court judge in a sexual offense, analysts predicted a negative reaction from voters if the Republicans insist on approval.
Earlier this week, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said, “This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party.”
As Guy Cecil, the director of Priorities USA (a group that helps in the election campaign for the Democrats), noted in an interview with the news channel, “it’s not about the committee vote, the final vote, or that Kavanaugh was in the dock, but how they reacted to this situation and how.”
However, the opinions of Americans about whose testimony to believe, Ford or Kavanaugh, are divided. A little more support has Ford.
According to a new survey from YouGov, 41% of respondents believe or rather believe Ford’s testimony, while 35% of respondents believe or rather believe Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38% of respondents said that, in their opinion, Kavanaugh gave or most likely gave false testimony, while 30% of respondents said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, after the insistence of Flake, the FBI is checking the accusations made by Ford and another plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee about how Kavanaugh attacked her while intoxicated when she was 17.
Ramirez said a Supreme Court justice candidate showed her his genitals at a party during their studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the world Internet plans to launch a "new Internet" to create competition with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend of the world of technology, the company Inrupt, is developing an open source platform Solid, the idea of which belongs to Berners-Lee.
With the Solid platform, users will be able to choose where to store data and to whom to provide access to this or that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology, which will allow users to create a "personal online data store" or POD.
It can store contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, audio library, and other tools for your own use and work.
It’s like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify in the same browser at the same time.
A unique feature of this personal online data warehouse is that it fully meets the needs of the user who can access any information.
The company calls it “the expansion of personal capabilities through data.”
According to Inrupt CEO John Bruce, the company aims to leverage resources, processes and relevant skills to make the Solid platform accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired from IBM, several full-time developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world can create their own standalone apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not in talks with Facebook and Google about whether to make a full replacement when all their business models undergo radical changes in a short period of time.
“We don’t ask their permission.”
In a post Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to “provide commercial energy and ecosystem and help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential figure in the debate over net neutrality.
Even at the time of the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remained the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, The Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I am very optimistic about the next era of network development,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: celebration of the awarding of the order of the Cross of Victoria to a representative of the church during the First World War
The only representative of the Church of England, who received the Order of the Cross of Victoria for participation in hostilities during the First World War, is honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vanne received the award for his participation in the attack at Belangliz and Leocourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper's bullet four days later and never found out that he had received the highest military award in Britain.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, called it “extremely symbolic” that the unveiling of the memorial stone took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather performed the feat for which he received the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann moved his battalion through the Canal Saint-Kathen "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire of field guns and machine guns".
Later, he hurried to the firing line and with "desperate courage" led the formation forward, before that one broke through to the field gun and destroyed three guns of the enemy unit.
Lt. Col. Vann was shot dead by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said that his grandfather did something that he himself would never be able to repeat and that deserves respect.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, laid the wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feels very proud to take part in this parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the respect that so many people show him."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch the Bellator 206 tournament and were shown Peppa Pig instead
Imagine you’re up all night just to watch an eventful Bellator 206 tournament, and you’re denied the opportunity to view the main event.
Posters of the tournament, which took place in San Jose, indicated 13 fights, including six matches of the main program, which were broadcast live at night in the UK on channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just before Geghard Musashi and Rory McDonald were preparing to meet in a duel, television viewers in the UK froze in amazement when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen instead of the broadcast of the battle.
Some spectators were not thrilled by this, as they did not sleep until the very morning, waiting for the battle.
One fan wrote on Twitter that switching to a children's cartoon seemed to him "some kind of a bad joke."
“According to the government’s ruling, the content aired at 6 a.m. was inappropriate, so they were forced to put on a children’s show,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and public relations, said when asked about the show.
Peppa Pig, yeah.
Bellator President Scott Cocker has promised to work on the broadcast schedule to reach viewers in the UK in the future.
“I think if we talk about a repeat of the broadcast, then we can arrange it,” said Coker.
“But now there is Sunday, 6 am, and we will not be able to do anything until we have Sunday, and in them – Monday.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was turned off, we received a lot of messages to which we responded, and the text of these messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical problem and tried to fix it.
However, it turned out that it was a violation of government regulations.
I can promise you that this will never happen again.
We will reduce the tournament to five fights instead of the usual six. We tried to redirect the signal for the fans, but so far we have postponed these attempts.
It's a really unpleasant situation."
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “worse” than others because of his sexual orientation
Olympic water-jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t realize that “not everyone is like him” until he went to high school.
Taking part in the broadcast of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, which is hosted by Lauren Laverne, he noted that he openly spoke about the rights of gays to give "hope" to others.
He also stated that his fatherhood made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The presenter, who has been leading this program for a long time, Kirsty Young, went to the hospital for several months.
Arriving as a pariah for Laverne's first program, Daley stated that he felt "worse" than others as a child because "society didn't take it when someone liked boys and girls."
He said, "Until now, feeling inferior and different was exactly what gave me the strength and drive to succeed."
According to him, he sought to prove that something is "worth it", so as not to disappoint all those who eventually learned about his orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent advocate for LGBT rights and has taken advantage of his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He stated that he spoke openly about his views because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and wanted to give this "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion admitted that the feeling for his husband, American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, was a real surprise for him.
Daley married an Oscar-winning actor 20 years his senior last year, but the age difference was never an issue, he said.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" (at the first Olympic Games he performed at the age of 14, and three years later his father died of cancer), it is difficult to find someone of his age who would also have experienced similar ups and downs.
In June, the couple had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and since then, according to Daley, his "worldview" has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, I would have thought only that I should get the gold,” he said.
“You know what, there are things that are much more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn’t put up with the idea of an end and before he died asked if they had bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘you’re not going to sit in the front row because you’re not going to be around anymore,’” Daley said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died did I finally realize he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daly took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
“I knew that was what I had been dreaming of all my life: diving in front of my countrymen at the Olympic Games, and there was no feeling better than that,” Daley said.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song – Proud performed by Heather Small – which resonated with him in preparation for the Olympic Games and still evokes ants.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15am English summer time.
On Saturday, from the match of the tournament for the "Rider Cup" took Michelson, who was not in shape
American Phil Mikkelson set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th game in the tournament for the Ryder Cup, but he has to restore shape so that this event is not unhappy for him.
Michelson, who for the record 12th time participates in the tournament, which takes place every two years, was taken out of the game by Captain Jim Furik for the duration of the forbols and forks.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he often did when playing for the United States, the five-time winner cheered the team all day and trained on the sidelines, hoping to master the emotions.
Since Mikkelson was not famous for hitting even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old athlete was not quite suitable for the complex golf course Le Golf National, where the reef is usually punished for straying strokes.
And if the field itself is not such an obstacle, in the ninth match on Sunday, Michelson will have to meet with the champion of the Open Championship and the master of precision kick Francesco Molinari, who paired with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood won all his matches this week.
If the Americans, who are three points behind after 12 singles matches, start well, the Michelson match can be decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his athlete, and, probably, besides this, he had nothing to add.
“He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said that he would be ready tomorrow,” Furik said.
“He has no doubt about his abilities.
Michelson is a Hall of Famer who has done so much for the teams last week and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play in two games.
I predicted more matches, but it turned out that way, so we decided to do that.
He wants to be there, on the field, like everyone else.”
If Michelson goes on the field on Saturday, he will beat the record of Nick Faldo, who played the largest number of matches in the Ryder Cup tournament.
At this point, he may end his career in the Ryder Cup tournament, which never corresponded to his individual achievements.
Michelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, but Furik said his presence could play a decisive role for the team.
“He’s funny, funny, witty, likes to joke with others, he’s a guy that’s great to have on the team,” explained Furik.
“I think the younger players had a good time coming up on him, as well as this week, and it was interesting to watch.
He’s more than just a player.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big gap doesn’t solve anything
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a noticeable gap before the singles matches of the last day of the tournament for the Ryder Cup does not yet guarantee victory.
Dane made his debut in 1997 in a match on the pitch of the club Valderrama, where the team led by Sev Ballesteros was ahead of the Americans by five points, but won the match by a small margin with a score of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You remind yourself that we had a big gap in the match at the Valderrama field; a big gap in Brooklyn where we lost, and in the Valderrama field where we hardly won,” Bjorn said after watching the Class 2018 winning games with a score of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at the Le Golf National stadium, which is the 10th after.
So history teaches me and every player on the team that nothing has been decided yet.
Tomorrow we have to play with the maximum return.
Go out on the field and do whatever you need to do.
The game will be completed only after the result appears on the scoreboard.
We have a goal – to win this trophy, and this is what we want.
As I said before, I’m focusing on the 12 players on our team, but we’re well aware of who’s up against us – the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with the performance of his players on the difficult field, Bjorn added: "I will never run ahead.
Tomorrow may be different.
We’re going to have an individual match tomorrow, and that’s something else.
It’s great to play on the field with a partner when things are going well, but it’s when you’re standing there alone that you can test what you’re worth as a golfer.
Here’s how to set up players to perform tomorrow: at the limit of possibilities.
You leave your partner without support and now he also has to show what he is capable of.”
Unlike Bjorn, opposite number Jim Furik expects his partners to play the best game on an individual level, with the exception of Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
To Furik himself, fate on the last day returned to different sides: he was among the winners in Brooklyn, but was defeated when a team from Europe created the "Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the team’s captain in 1999, organized players before the last day of the competition.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we need to start successfully, as it was in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative goes to someone's side, players in the middle of the distance are subjected to special pressure.
We’ve got the players on the team in a proper way, like we’re going to, like, do something incredible tomorrow.”
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead a counter-offensive in a top-flight match against Rory McIlroy, followed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the first half of the European team list.
“It is these partners and in this order that I have chosen because I want to evenly distribute the effort throughout the game,” Bjorn commented on his choice of players for individual matches.
The commissioning of a new German warship was again postponed
The most modern frigate of the German Navy was supposed to be put into operation back in 2014 instead of outdated warships of the Cold War. However, according to local media, this will not happen until at least next year due to malfunctioning systems and rapid cost growth.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, received from a spokesman for the military department, the commissioning of the Rhineland-Palatinate ship, the main ship of the series of the most modern frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class, has been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but problems that arose after delivery hampered the implementation of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some technologies for reducing visibility, in particular, radar, infrared and acoustic.
Another important feature is a longer period of technical support. It is expected that the new frigates will not be able to return to the base port for about two years.
However, Die Zeit journalists warn that due to the constant delays, state-of-the-art warships, which were supposed to strengthen Germany's military power at sea, will also become obsolete at the time of commissioning.
The long-suffering F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into action and returned it to the Blohm + Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first case of the return of a warship to a shipbuilding company after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned significant "defects in software and equipment" that rendered the warship unsuitable for military operations.
The shortcomings of the software are of particular importance, as the crew of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ship consists of about 120 sailors – this is only half the number of soldiers who served on the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship has a significant excess weight, which worsens its performance and limits the possibilities for further modernization.
The Rhineland-Palatinate frigate is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, another problem was the total cost of the project, which also includes the cost of crew training.
The expected 2.2 billion euros turned into a huge 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion US dollars).
Problems with obtaining new frigates have gained special importance in the light of recent warnings about the decline of the German naval forces.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the Bundestag’s commissioner for the armed forces, said that the country’s navy “had only a handful of ships capable of carrying out combat missions.”
The official said the situation had been rapidly deteriorating for some time as older vessels were decommissioned and new ones were not arriving.
He expressed deep regret that none of the frigates of the "Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg" class could not replenish the navy.
The National Trust will observe the secret life of bats
A new study, which is being conducted on land in the Scottish Highlands, aims to establish how bats use the landscape in search of food.
Scientists hope that the data will help shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in order to conduct conservation measures in the future.
In the gardens of Inveryu in Western Ross, scientists of the National Trust of Scotland will observe such species as the dwarf bat and the pygmy bat, as well as the common eared and water nightshade.
Special recorders will be placed in strategic locations on the land to monitor bat behavior throughout the season.
Employees and volunteers of the National Trust of Scotland will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to determine the frequency and belonging of bat cries.
Then it is planned to develop a detailed map of the habitat of animals and prepare a report to link the behavior of animals with their habitat.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at the National Trust of Scotland, hopes the findings will help determine which habitats are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of habitat management measures (e.g. grassland formation) and identify optimal forest conservation practices for bats and other related species.
Over the last century, bat populations have declined significantly in Scotland and the United Kingdom.
They are threatened by active construction and development of territories, which deprives them of nesting places.
Other negative factors include wind installations and lighting, fly glue paper, chemical processing of building materials, and attacks of domestic cats.
They are not actually blind.
However, through hunting at night, the ears are more effective in helping them catch prey than the eyes.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles on the flight path.
The National Trust of Scotland, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of special importance and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bat problems very seriously.
Ten specially trained experts regularly conduct research, check nesting sites and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization even created the first and only bat reserve in Scotland. It is located on the territory of the Triv estate in the Dumfries and Galloway region. It sheltered eight of the ten species of bats living in Scotland.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says it’s the perfect place for them.
"On the territory of the estate lasted excellent conditions for bats", - he assures.
“There are old buildings, many giant trees and other favorable living conditions.
But we still have a lot to learn about bats, and thanks to the research we're doing here and elsewhere, we'll be able to learn more about what they need to thrive."
He insists that it is very important to check the territory for the presence of bats before carrying out any technical work, because due to the unintentional destruction of one nesting site for the removal of young can kill up to 400 females with cubs, which is likely to cause the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats and their nests are protected by law. Animals are forbidden to kill, torture or disturb.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer at Scotland’s Bat Conservation Centre, urged the public to join the organisation’s efforts.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats. We have not yet revealed the characteristics of populations of many species."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations, and his lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against the German edition
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations a “slander” and said people were “trying to get attention” using his name.
His lawyers are ready to file a lawsuit against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published information about suspicions.
Katharine Mayorga has accused the Portugal striker and Juventus football club of raping her in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
According to Der Spiegel magazine on Friday, Ronaldo allegedly paid her $375,000 for her silence.
A few hours after the charges were brought, Ronaldo, 33, addressed his 142 million fans in a video broadcast on Instagram, calling the corresponding messages a “defamation”.
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today’s accusations are slander,” the five-time Golden Ball winner made such a statement on camera.
“They want to attract attention by using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to take advantage of me, but situations like this are part of my job.
I’m a happy person and I’m doing well,” the footballer added, smiling.
According to Reuters news agency, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the published charges, which they called an "inadmissible report of suspicion in the sphere of private life".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer will seek compensation for "moral damage in an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is likely to be one of the most high-profile cases of violation of personal rights in recent years."
It is alleged that the incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after a meeting at the nightclub Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her. Such evidence was transferred to the district court of Clark County (Nevada).
Mayorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees in front of her and said that he was "99 percent good guy" who was let down by "one percent".
As stated in the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with the model, but by mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she turned to the police and then to the hospital, where the injuries she received were photographed. However, she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement, because she "feared revenge" and was afraid of "public humiliation".
Now a 34-year-old woman seeks to cancel the previous arrangement as she continues to suffer because of the incident, which she said took place.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was preparing for the transition to Real Madrid FC from Manchester United FC. This summer he became a player of the giants of Italian football, the Juventus team, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will ‘forever regret’ loss of carmakers
The UK will "forever regret" if it loses its status as a world leader in the field of automotive production after Brexit. This is warned by the Minister of Economy Greg Clark.
He added that he was excited by a statement from Toyota UK, which told BBC reporters that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, the company would be forced to suspend production and operations of its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” said Secretary Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The plant in Bernaston, which produces Toyota cars models Auris and Avensis, last year produced about 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my view, if the UK leaves the EU in an emergency at the end of March, production at our plant will be halted,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s chief executive officer in Bernaston.
Other automakers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about how the UK’s exit from the EU without an agreement on international trade will affect.
For example, BMW said that the plant for the production of the Mini model in Oxford will be closed a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of automakers are that a no-deal Brexit could pose risks to supply chains.
Toyota’s production line operates in a mode of prompt delivery of parts and materials according to needs – the parts come every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruptions to parts supplies at the border, leading to delays and material shortages.
As noted in the company, in the Toyota warehouse you can place parts for no more than one day. So production will have to stop.
Greg Clark noted that the plan for the organization of relations with the EU, prepared by Theresa May (Chequers Plan), “separately provides for schemes to avoid problems at the border.”
"We need a deal. We need to make an optimal deal, which, in my opinion, will allow not only to succeed at the moment, but also to take advantage of the prospects that have arisen," he said during the Today program on BBC Radio 4.
“Given the evidence from Toyota, as well as other automakers, we urgently need to maintain established high-efficiency supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production will be stopped, but in the long run it is expected that the increase in costs will lead to a decrease in the competitiveness of the plant and, as a result, will force a reduction in jobs.
Peter Tsuvalaris, chairman of the organizing committee of the Unite trade union at the Bernaston plant, who has worked here for 24 years, said the other participants were extremely concerned: “From experience, I can say that reduced jobs are not being restored.”
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward a precise and credible plan to shape our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump, Rosenstein meeting could be postponed again, White House says
White House officials said on Sunday that a responsible meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” while discussions continue over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the post of Supreme Court Justice.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election meddling, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and the president’s potential obstruction of justice.
For months, Washington has been discussing the possibility of firing a deputy attorney general, which would jeopardize Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke out about the use of microphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of early termination of the presidential powers under the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday, he visited the White House amid reports that the official was about to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then at UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he "wouldn't like" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate Judiciary Committee meeting, which was to testify Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blazie Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox News Sunday television show.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date of the meeting has not been set. Perhaps it will take place this week. I expect it to be postponed for another week, given all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see. I'm constantly making sure that the press has the latest information."
Some journalists disagreed: Sanders has not given a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the infrequent briefings were not due to dislike of the "public game" by television reporters, though she added: "I won't deny that they're playing the public game."
Then she suggested that Trump himself will communicate with the press more.
“The president answers questions more often than any president before him,” she said, without referring to the source.
Sanders said that the briefings will still be held, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask a question to the President of the United States, it's better than talking to me."
We try to communicate with the press often. This should be especially noticeable in the last few weeks. The opportunity to talk to the President of the United States is not worse than a press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions during events outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences with high-profile guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why this is the case by acting uninhibitedly and at times savagely in front of reporters.
Scotland’s health secretary in a letter to EU workers over Brexit fears
The Secretary of State for Health has written to citizens of other EU countries who work for the National Health Service of Scotland to express their appreciation for their work and to ask them to continue after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before Britain’s exit from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the cost of applications for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in autonomous public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman said: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue of withdrawal continued. This autumn, we should expect appropriate decisions.
But the UK government is stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal exit.
I know that this period can be very disturbing for you.
That is why I would like to emphasize again how I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union and beyond share valuable experiences and skills, strengthening and improving the health service for the benefit of patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home. We really want you to stay."
Christion Ebercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury
Midfielder of the team "Tennessee State Tigers" Christion Ebercrombie suffered an urgent operation after receiving a head injury in Sunday's match against "Vanderbilt Commodores", which his team lost with a score of 31:27. This was reported by a journalist of the newspaper Tennessee.
The head coach of the Tennessee State Tigers team told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
“He came to the sideline where he was sick,” Reid said.
On the sidelines, coaches and medical staff gave Ebercrombie oxygen before picking him up on stretchers for further examination.
A spokesman for the Tennessee State Tigers team told Chris Harris from the WSMV channel (Nashville, Tennessee) that Ebercrombie operated at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no evidence yet of the type and severity of the injury." The Tennessee State Tigers are trying to find out when the player was injured.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, spent his first season at the Tennessee State Tigers after moving from the Illinois team.
He made five intercepts of the ball on Sunday before dropping out of the game. Thus, for the season he has 18 intercepts.
Foreign buyers will pay more government duty if they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay more duty in the event of the purchase of real estate in the UK. According to the new plans of Tori, additional funds will be spent to help the homeless
This measure neutralizes all attempts by Corbyn to attract young voters
Higher state duty will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance hopes to attract an additional 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
As Theresa May announced today, foreigners buying real estate in the UK will pay more duty. Additional funds will be spent on helping the homeless.
The move could be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises of more affordable housing aimed at high-paying workers.
The increase in duties will apply to individuals and legal entities that do not pay taxes in the UK. The government will send additional funds to help those who are forced to spend the night in the open air.
The additional duty, which accompanies the increase of two years ago on second housing and real estate intended for rental, can be three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes to attract an additional 120 million pounds per year.
According to experts, 13% of new real estate, which is being built in London, falls into the ownership of foreign citizens. This leads to higher prices and complicates the task for those who only dream of their own housing.
Many affluent areas of the country, particularly in the capital, are empty, as a large number of foreign buyers live outside the country most of the time.
The new action plan comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in government tariffs to make housing more affordable for young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by buying up land without further use. He called on Theresa May to abandon quotas on affordable real estate in order to correct the “shameful situation in the housing market” in the UK.
Mr. Corbyn announced a number of important reforms in the real estate sector, including the control of rents and the impossibility of eviction without good reason.
He also proposes to expand the powers of local councils in the field of construction of new housing.
Theresa May said: “Last year I promised that I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream – for each new generation, life must be better.
This needs to change in our imperfect housing market.
The UK will always remain open to those who want to live, work and build their future here.
However, it can not be called fair that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, buy housing on the same terms as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become unattainable. The problem of living in the open is still very painful.”
Jack Ross: ‘I want to be the head coach of Scotland’
Sunderland head coach Jack Ross says he is "above all eager" to lead Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman has taken to re-establish the club from the north-east of the country, which now ranks third in the First Football League, three points behind the leader.
Ross moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, returning to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I made the second team in Scotland, but that was the end of it,” Ross said during the Sportsound program on BBC Scotland radio.
“When I was a kid, my father and I used to watch the Scottish national team play at Hampden Park.
The only hope for me remains to be successful as head coach of the club.”
Ross's predecessors at Sunderland included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gustavo Poet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former head coach of Alloa Athletic said he did not feel the excitement of moving to a big club after such authoritative names, having previously rejected offers from FC Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the current stage, I believe that I have achieved success if the club returns to the Premier League.
Due to its structure and material and technical support, this club, without a doubt, corresponds to the level of the Premier League,” he said.
“It will not be an easy task, but I will hardly consider the other result successful for myself.”
Ross has only been building a coaching career for three years. Before that, he worked as a second coach at FC Dumbarton, and also spent 15 months at the coaching staff of FC Harts.
He then helped Alloa recover after FC were placed in the third division, and the following season with Saint Mirren went from being relegated to winning the first division title.
According to Ross, he now feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career with Clyde, Gartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“I found myself at a crossroads,” he recalls, talking about the transition to FC Alloa.
“I truly believed that coaching was more suited to me than playing.
It sounds strange, because I was successful, made good money on it and reached certain heights.
But playing is not easy.
There are many difficulties that we have to overcome every week.
I still face them, experiencing stress and tension, but in the role of head coach I feel in my place.
I have always been interested in coaching. I have never felt so comfortable in my entire adult life, as after choosing this profession. "

Study: 17:30 on Sunday – the perfect time for a mug of beer
The summer heat has helped boost revenue for British pubs, which are not going through the best of times, but has increased pressure on the restaurant chain.
According to estimates, sales in pubs and bars in July increased by 2.7%, while restaurant profits decreased by 4.8%.
Calculations author Peter Martin from CGA, a business development consultancy, said: "Thanks to the sunny weather and the longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Cup, July went according to the same scheme as the previous month, when pub revenue grew by 2.8%. But restaurants did even worse.
The June drop of 1.8% in July increased.
Pubs and bars focused on serving drinks have the best performance so far – the growth of their profits is equivalent to the loss of restaurants.
Pubs that serve food are also affected by the heat, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that visitors are only interested in drinking.
In controlled pubs and bars, sales of beverages for the month increased by 6.6%. At the same time, food sales decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, RSM’s Permit and Hotel Business Analyst, said: “We’ve seen similar trends since the end of April.
Weather and large-scale social or sporting events remain the main factors affecting sales in the domestic market.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant groups continue to lose profits. The annual sales drop of 4.8% is of particular concern against the background of the need to reduce costs.
The long hot summer has not come at the best time for food service establishments. Let’s see if the milder temperature we observed in August can give them such a necessary rest.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the market launch of new brands.
The industry sales indicator Coffer Peach Tracker in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector of the UK is a reflection of the collected and analyzed performance indicators of 47 working groups, the total turnover of which exceeds <0xC2><0xA3> 9 billion. This is a generally accepted industry standard.
Every fifth child has a hidden from parents account in the social network
According to the results of the study, every fifth child, sometimes not older than 11 years, has a hidden account from parents and teachers in social networks.
A study involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
This news has raised concerns about the possible placement of content of a sexual nature
20% of students reported having a “core account” that they show to their parents
One in five children, sometimes under the age of 11, creates a social media account that hides them from adults.
A study involving 20,000 high school students found an increase in the number of fake pages on Instagram, a social network for sharing photos.
This news has raised concerns about the possible placement of content of a sexual nature.
20% of students reported having a clean “core” account that they show to their parents, as well as one or more private ones.
A mother who accidentally stumbled on the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter saw a call to “rape me” there.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in private schools found that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two social media profiles. Half of these children admitted that the additional account is secret.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: “We are very concerned about the fact that many teenagers feel a desire to create an online space where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Ailey Doyle to be ‘Athletes’ Interests Representative’ on Scottish Athletics Board
Ailey Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as an independent director during the annual general meetings of the board members.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete. Council Chairman Ian Beatty called this step a great opportunity for those who lead the sports movement to take advantage of her extensive experience gained at the international level over the past decade.
“Ailid has great respect among athletes in Scotland, the UK and the world. We are convinced that by involving her in the Council, athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly,” said Beatty.
Doyle said: "I will be inspired to act as a representative of the interests of athletes. I hope that I can really benefit and contribute to the development of sport in Scotland."
The American, a four-time Olympic champion who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and now a sports columnist for the BBC, lost the ability to walk due to a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time would tell if I could recover and to what extent.
Thanks to incredible efforts, I was able to fully recover. I learned to walk again and today I am doing dynamic exercises!
Thank you for your words of support!”
In the advertising of the milk extractor, women were compared with cows – the opinions of Internet users were divided
The manufacturer of milk extractors has faced an ambiguous reaction from Internet users to advertising in which young mothers are compared with dairy cows.
To mark the release of the product, dubbed “the world’s first silent breast milk extractor,” consumer goods technology company Elvie released a humorous music video-style ad to demonstrate the freedom that the new extractor provides mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a blue-filled barn to a song containing the following words: "Yes, I feed myself, but I have no tail" and "As you can see, this is not a udder, but my chest."
Then the choir sings: "Suck, suck, to feed the children. Suck, suck, so that the milk is not wasted."
However, the commercial, published on the company's Facebook page, caused a heated discussion online.
The video received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. However, the reaction of Internet users was ambiguous. Many noted that the advertising underestimated the "terrible organization" of milk production in the industry.
“It’s not a very smart decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to give milk. However, their children are vilely taken away from them a few days after birth,” one of the users wrote.
The Elvie milk extractor can be easily hidden in the bra for feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Here’s another comment: “It’s clear that it’s traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why not attract them to advertise a milk extractor for women who need to feed their babies?"
Someone else added: "This advertisement is very far from reality."
Other users defended the ad. One of the women video seemed "very fun".
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would definitely buy such a thing if I was still breastfeeding.
When I drank the milk, I felt like a cow.
The advertising is a bit crazy, but I did not look for hidden content in it.
“It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Here's another comment: "Funny advertising focused on moms who suck milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This advertisement is not aimed at highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, women are shown milk extractors hidden in their bras.
The concept of the advertising campaign is based on the information that many women who use similar products feel like cows.
However, the Elvie suction cup works absolutely quietly, has no wires or tubes and easily hides in a bra for feeding. Thanks to this, women can move freely, keep children and even go outside.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of the advertising agency Mother, commented on the situation: "The Elvie suction cup is such a revolutionary product that it required a bright and provocative presentation.
Drawing a parallel between the milk-squeezing women and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the peculiarities of breastfeeding, in an exciting and interesting way demonstrating the incredible feeling of freedom that the new suction cup will bring.
Elvie’s suction cup doesn’t make the news headlines for the first time.
As part of London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk with this product during a fashion show by fashion designer Marta Jakubowska.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration’s tough rhetoric and policies have made it difficult to place children in care.
Traditionally, in most cases, the guardians were the immigrants themselves without documents. Now they are afraid to jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country, offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that prospective caregivers and other adult members of their households would be required to provide fingerprints and that this data would be passed on to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official at the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that Bureau officials arrested dozens of people who had applied for unaccompanied minor care.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80% of people who are guardians or members of their households are in the country illegally. Many of them are foreigners who have committed offenses.
Therefore, we continue to persecute these people,” Mr. Albens said.
According to the shelter, in order to speed up the handling of children’s cases, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of the children to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than 60 days as was previously the case.
Many of them will be able to use video conferencing, rather than come to court in person to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who are not entitled to asylum under the court decision will be quickly deported.
According to the shelter staff and official data from responsible officials in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression. This can cause outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Human rights activists argue that these problems are exacerbated in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological state of children.
They added that by moving children to the tent camp and not giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends, we risk exacerbating the trauma that many of them have already experienced.
Syria orders ‘occupying forces’ of US, France and Turkey to withdraw troops immediately
In addition, speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country has been at war for eight years.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism, so “regarding them would be appropriate.”
“They must leave immediately and not impose conditions,” he told the assembly.
Muallem insisted that the “war on terror is effectively over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have fled their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territory” from terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The U.S. has deployed about 2,000 troops to Syria, mostly to train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
In the war-ravaged country, France sent more than 1,000 soldiers.
As for refugees, Muallem assured that the country has created the right conditions for their return. He also accused "some Western countries" of "spreading unfounded fears" because of which refugees do not dare to return.
“We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help people return,” he said.
“We are seeing attempts to politicize a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not assist Syria in rebuilding the country until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats will report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone around Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
Thanks to the Russian-Turkish agreement, it was possible to prevent a large-scale attack by Syrian forces, supported by Russia, on the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem stressed that the deal has a “clear timeline” and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front militants, who “will be destroyed.”
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and create conditions for elections.
Muallem put forward the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying his work should be limited to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump will be reelected
Under this logic, Trump could be re-elected in 2020 if, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, he does not resign early after the scandal and impeachment.
Without a doubt, it would have been “the most dramatic presidential conclusion of all time”!
At the moment, the audience does not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of prime-time viewers has more than doubled (to 1.05 million) on CNN and has actually tripled (to 1.6 million) on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on the cable channel MSNBC topped the ratings with 3.5 million viewers on the evening when the main news is discussed.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s beyond our understanding,” said Neil Behr, executive producer of the ABC drama The Last Candidate, about a secretary of state who becomes president after a devastating attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer-humorist and author of the book "Only funny moments: as well as a few harsh truths about the penetration of Hollywood men's club" offers another theory.
She recalled a trip in a Boston taxi before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh," he said. That's the story Mrs. Scovell told me.
Chaos is fun.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, stories from Washington are able to determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the possibility of reuniting immigrant families, and the state of the world economy.
Distraction is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet you can’t say that you’re just trying to stay informed citizens when you watch for six hours as a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward’s use of “well-informed” sources for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-skin jacket (“dresses for the arrogant” – so described in the Washington Post) and the aftermath of the Washington Post
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be the same again.
“The feeling of a reality show is partly due to the fact that you are fed something new every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the TV program “Stars of the Lombard”, about the rotation in the cast and the daily plot twists in the show “Championship” (Conflict).
If you allow yourself to miss at least one episode, you can hopelessly fall behind.
When I managed to meet Mr. Fleiss this week at his home on the north coast of Kauai, there was warm sunny weather (27 degrees Celsius) but he was sitting at home watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn’t get away from the TV — not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hung in the balance.
“I remember when we used to do all those crazy shows and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss told me.
“I took it as a joke, but it looks like they were right.”

External infusions into the toughest midterm elections in Congress
Not surprisingly, the 17th district of Pennsylvania sent additional cash infusions, because through the revision of the boundaries of the constituencies, two current congressmen compete for one seat.
In the struggle for this suburban area of Pittsburgh, the borders of which were recently changed, enters a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives Conor Lamb, who won a victory in another district in an additional election last spring.
Lamb opposes another incumbent congressman, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who now represents Pennsylvania's old 12th congressional district, whose boundaries largely coincide with the new 17th congressional district.
The maps were reworked after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old boundaries of the districts were drawn in favor of Republicans in violation of the constitution.
The pre-election race in the new 17th arrondissement caused a fierce confrontation between the financial units of the main parties, the Democratic Party Committee on Elections to Congress (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NRCC).
Lemba's surname became very famous in Pennsylvania after winning with a minimal lead in the 18th district during the additional congressional elections in March, which enjoyed wide public attention.
This place belonged to Republicans for more than a decade. President Donald Trump won in this district with an advantage of 20 points.
Political experts gave little preference to the Democrats.
The United States considered the possibility of punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but changed its mind
Diplomats recalled Washington's weak resistance to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, which previously supported Beijing's position.
In June 2017, Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela. Earlier, Trump also had a hotel in Panama, until the partners expelled staff hired by the Trump Organization.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan,” Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
But the sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, particularly in the field of drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The proposed fines, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for this Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rate.
According to the results of internal meetings, officials from the countries of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity. A similar event was held last year, and it was regarded as a step forward in efforts aimed at curbing the flow of migrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they want the conference to take place. In fact, on this, the consideration of the issue of sanctions against El Salvador has ceased.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence now plans to speak at the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, in a sign that the administration considers this event very important.
The three U.S. ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, as there were no new tough messages or punishments from Washington.
Bolton’s White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the internal discussions, which were reported by three U.S. officials, two of whom were diplomats, on condition of anonymity.
The information they provided was confirmed by a third-party analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study the history
The next nuisance could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, a powerful confirmation of why it can be found in the now available public information.
As part of his investigation, Mueller is reportedly testing a possible link between Trump’s campaign and Russia’s attack on our voting system.
If congressional influence falls into other hands, Trump will have to report to Congress, as well as to voters and, ultimately, to fellow party members.
There is a lot of “if” in this case, and I don’t want to say that the fall of Trump is inevitable, as are his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make a choice that will determine the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West began to resist him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed and lost the opportunity to avoid bloodshed.
The course of history is determined by such turning points, and the unrestrained movement of democracy is accelerated or slowed down.
Americans are now waiting for a few such turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom Mr. Mueller’s fate depends?
Rosenstein was in trouble when the newspaper reported that last year he offered to secretly record conversations with the president and shared his thoughts on the topic of Trump’s inconsistency.
Rosenstein called the information in the newspaper The Times inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the investigation into Brett Kavanaugh, which was recently launched by the FBI, turns out to be insufficiently thorough or honest, or if Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the Supreme Court is approved, despite convincing allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And above all, will we, in the medium term, vote for those members of Congress who will be able to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, bad times will come for democracy.
But I believe that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light Saturday candles on a swastika table.
With such an inheritance, can I not look with optimism to the future?”

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic about a meeting with the Viennese Rapid
FC "Rangers" takes "Rapid" (Vienna) on Thursday. After an impressive draw in Spain in the game with Villarreal earlier this month, the victory over the Austrians will provide the Scottish club with a good chance of leaving the Group G of the Europa League.
Due to knee injury midfielder Graham Dorrance was able to play for his team for the first time in the season only in the match with Villarreal, which ended with the score 2: 2. However, he believes that FC "Rangers" can use this result as a springboard to achieve more.
“For us it was a good result, because Villarreal is a strong team,” said the 31-year-old player.
“We came to the game hoping to get something and got one point.
Perhaps at the end of the match we could come forward, but in general, a draw can probably be considered a fair result.
In the first half, the opponent was the best, but after the break we corrected the situation in our favor.
On Thursday, there will be another important confrontation in the Europa League.
I hope we can get three points, but it will not be easy. Our future opponents showed a good result in their last game. However, we can count on the support of the fans. I am sure that we will be able to give a fight and get a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, starting with my injuries and ending with changes in the club itself. But now the situation has normalized.
We have a great squad and all the guys are happy. The training is going well.
I hope we can move on, leave last season behind and be successful.”
Women lose sleep because of fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they would like to organize self-care, few talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they spoke to their husband or wife about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of respondents talked about it with children.
“People want to be taken care of by a family member, but they’re in no hurry to have a conversation about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
This is where you need to start.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: your family will not be able to provide you with the care you need if you do not tell your wishes to relatives in advance.
Consult your counselor and family to determine where and how to receive care, as this choice can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Get a financial advisor: he can advise on how to cover the relevant costs.
Sources of financing for long-term care include a traditional insurance policy, a hybrid life-accumulative insurance policy, or self-insurance at your own expense (provided you have the money).
Carefully prepare legal documents: this will allow you to avoid legal delays in advance.
Prepare a power of attorney for your representative, who will monitor your medical care and make sure that specialists fulfill your wishes in case you can not do it in person.
In addition, we advise you to issue a power of attorney for the disposal of funds.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay the bills in case of your disability.
Do not forget about minor details. Imagine that one of your elderly parents needs urgent medical care, so he is taken to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Write down this information to be ready.
“It’s not just about finances. It’s about who the doctors are,” Martin says.
What medications can be taken and
Who takes care of the dog?
Make a plan like that.”
In Ilfracombe, a man shot several times with a pneumatic rifle
The man fired several shots from a pneumatic rifle as he was returning home from a party.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
The officers described the shooting, which took place at 2:30 a.m. British summer time, as an "accident".
The victim did not see the assailant.
His injuries do not pose a threat to life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, government officials said, but the death toll could rise.
Due to the failure of communications, officials dealing with humanitarian aid issues cannot obtain any information from the Dongala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
After the disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some basic facts about the city of Palu located on the island of Sulawesi and the regency of Dongala.
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 people as of 2017.
When the earthquake that caused the tsunami occurred, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency that extends for more than 300 km (180 mi) along the coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi.
According to data for 2017, the regency, an administrative region located in the lower part of the province, is home to about 299,200 people.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sectors of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Moroval, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Dongala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami also hit the western part of Dongala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Below are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, located in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, most of them in Aceh province.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake shook southern Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, and caused a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 was recorded near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake shook one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, causing a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the Pidijaya Regency in Aceh province, causing devastation and panic due to the fact that people had not yet managed to forget the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died under the rubble of buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed many houses, and thousands of tourists could not immediately leave the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
A 29-year-old Palin, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and charged with obstructing the reporting of a violent incident and resisting arrest, Alaska State Police said on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a woman I know tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he took away her phone.
As reported by KTUU, Palin is in custody in the detention center Matanuska-Susitna with the right to bail in the amount of $ 500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent" when asked if he would plead guilty, the network said.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, including a one-year arrest and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with Class B misdemeanors, which is punishable by a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
It’s not the first time Palin has faced criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, as well as for obstructing the reporting of a domestic violence incident and carrying a gun while intoxicated when the incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for justifying her son’s violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, the earthquake caused a tsunami: killed hundreds of people
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Communications and electricity networks are out of order, and the number of victims may increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the center of the island of Sulawesi, located in the northeast of the capital of Indonesia Jakarta.
The video, distributed on social networks, shows the moment when the element hit.
Hundreds of people gathered for the festival on the beach of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death penalty for suspect in New York terror attack
In New York, federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York City bombing that killed eight people — a rare punishment that hasn’t been used in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, Saipov, a 30-year-old truck rented from Home Depot, reportedly rode a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and began to shoot down cyclists and pedestrians who happened to be in his way.
According to a report of intent to seek execution filed in New York’s Southern District to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight people and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm.
According to court documents, each of these charges provides for the possibility of the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury charged Saipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for the purpose of extortion, which federal prosecutors usually bring in cases related to organized crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of vehicles.
According to prosecutors, who described Saipov’s crime as “horrible, cruel and malicious,” the attack was the result of “careful planning and premeditated intent.”
The victims that Sayfulla Habibullaevich Saipov injured, injured or killed were Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Lora Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Mendoza.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the last time a criminal case was opened in the Southern District of New York, which carries the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug suppliers and eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty in a federal case was carried out in New York was in 1953. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show remorse in the days and months following the attack.
According to police, he told investigators that he does not regret what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out an attack on ISIS videos that he was viewing on his phone.
Police say he also asked for the Islamic State flag to be hoisted in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who represent Saipov, said they were “very disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea and a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only exacerbate the psychological trauma caused by these events to all victims,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense party had previously also asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
MP from the Conservative party believes that the most powerful Farage should be appointed responsible for the negotiations on Brexit
Today, during a protest at the Conservative Party Congress, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army."
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians should "feel the pressure" from eurosceptics as one of parliament's Theresa May offered her candidacy for talks with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom “would already have come out” if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
Attention to the problems that May faced in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks, even more attracted by the fact that MPs from the Conservative Party, who oppose the exit, joined a special protest in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is struggling to implement Chequers’ compromise plan, despite attacks from Brexit supporters, those opposed to Brexit, and the EU.
The allies insist that it will not abandon attempts to negotiate with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what it offers and “chaos”.
At a Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull, Mr. Bone said he wanted to "abandon Chequers".
He asked Mr Farage to step out of the shadows and take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible for this, we would have already left,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to give up Chequers.”
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestion that after the 2016 vote, public opinion had changed: “The idea that the British have changed their mind and do not want to leave is absolutely not true.”
Conservative Party member and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins, who was also at the march, told reporters: “I’m just saying, ‘Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not supported by our party and our activists, who actually walk the streets and fight for the votes.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening.”
In an address to Theresa May, she added: “Prime Ministers retain their office when they deliver on their promises.”
Mr Farage said politicians should “feel the pressure” if they are going to abandon the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people and our political elite,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to say they will not get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political elite, who are planning to betray the idea of Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country, which will lead us to victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of the exit passed Birmingham, and then held a two-hour rally in the city center.
Several activists waved “Conservatives Against Brexit” banners after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for having security concerns over their party programme after the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can use the IT systems and technologies needed for Canada-plus, a well-organized border, free trade with Ireland,” he said.
“This is a complete farce.
There is nothing good about Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to “think seriously” about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the elections in November, she "will seriously think about running for president."
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday during the general meeting in West Massachusetts, a representative of the Democratic Party from Massachusetts spoke about its future.
Warren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trump, is running for a second term in November against Republican Jeff Deal, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It is considered as the main candidate that can compete with Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, she held her 36th meeting with voters in a general assembly format since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she planned to participate in the presidential election.
Warren responded that "it's time for women to go to Washington and get the government working, and for that, a woman should be in charge."
Arrested a suspect in the murder of basketball player "LSU Tigers" Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU Tigers basketball player Wade Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Deaton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they posted a video of the shooting with a request to help identify the person on it.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead outside the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wade Sims received a gunshot wound to the head and was killed," Murphy Police Chief J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wade stepped in for his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the interrogation, it was found that Simpson was at the scene of the crime, had a gun with him and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton County Police Department.
Sims, who was 6 feet 6 inches tall and played in the junior league, grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games with 10 stars last season and averaged 17.4 minutes on the field, scoring 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton narrowed the gap in the fight for the world title after the team decided to give him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas left Lewis Hamilton behind on Saturday, it has become clear that Mercedes’ team decisions will play a significant role in the race.
Bottas started well from pole position and almost overtook Hamilton, who was trying to keep his position in the first two corners and gave Vettel the opportunity to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the pit stop first and left Hamilton on the track in the tail of the race, which had to solve everything.
The Mercedes driver rode another lap and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton broke into the lead after a certain wheel-to-wheel manoeuvre, causing the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the interior due to the risk of being clogged, after he managed to break out ahead in a double manoeuvre in the third corner.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and remained in seventh place until the end of the first round.
He was in the lead for most of the race, as he did not change the tyres to quickly reach the finish line and move Kimi Raikkonen from fourth place.
As a result, he stopped on the pit stop on the 44th lap, but could not increase the pace on the last eight, thanks to which Raikkonen took fourth place.
“It’s a tough day because Valtteri has been teaching full time all weekend and showing nobility when he gave me the opportunity to drive.
The team did an exceptional job to take first and second place,” said Hamilton.
The body language is not impressive.
At a rally on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein for her firm stance that she did not divulge the contents of a letter from Christine Blaise Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead expressed his opinion about the events in the Senate, which, according to him, demonstrated human “ meanness, abomination and falsehood.”
“The only thing that could have happened, and all the wonderful things that have been happening in the last few days in the Senate, is anger, you see evil people who are showing vileness, vileness and lies,” he said.
“You look at the publications and the disclosures, and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
It's not me."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you divulge information?
Remember her answer... Did you divulge the contents of the documents? – “What?
Oh, no.
I didn't disclose."
Wait a minute.
No, we did not disclose,” he added, copying the senator’s behavior.
In July, Feinstein received a letter detailing the allegations made by Ford against Kavanaugh, and in early September its contents were made public, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred in her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I did not divulge information obtained from her,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it a secret and I didn’t break my promise.”
However, her objection did not seem to please the president, who commented during Saturday’s rally: “I’ll tell you, her body language was not at all impressive.
Maybe she didn’t do it, but I’ve never seen anyone behave worse.”
Continuing to defend a Supreme Court candidate who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
“They are determined to return power by any means necessary.
You see meanness, abomination, they don’t care who they offend, who they have to step over in order to gain power and control,” Mediaite quoted the president as saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars – Belfast Giants, 5:3
Giants player Patrick Dwyer scored two goals in a match against Dundee
The Dundee Stars have been rehabilitated for Friday's loss to the Belfast Giants, winning the match-response with a score of 5:3.
The Giants had an early advantage in two pucks thanks to the throws of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney evened the score in the home match, and then Dwyer again brought the Giants forward.
Dundee player Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard evened the score, and two goals by Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory.
This is the third of the season of the elite league defeat of Adam Keef team, which won a strong-willed victory over Dundee with a score of 2:1 on Friday night in Belfast.
This is the fourth meeting of the teams in the season. Three previous matches were won by the Giants.
Dwyer dropped the first puck in the fourth minute (3:35) after the passing of Kendall McFall, and four minutes later Bovillier, who received the puck from David Rutherford, doubled the score.
After a tense first period in the fourteenth minute (13:10), Sullivan returned the owners of the field to the game, and in the sixteenth minute (15:16) Coney, having received a puck from Matt Marquardt, equalized the score.
Dwyer secured the Giants' advantage over the first break, dropping his second puck at the end of the first period.
The field hosts regrouped, and Bushar in the twenty-eighth minute (27:37) again equalized the score, throwing the puck when his team numerically prevailed.
Thanks to the efforts of Coney and Charles Corcoran, Nielsen took Dundee forward for the first time at the end of the second period and secured the victory of his team in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the Giants, who have already lost four of their last five games, will play an away match against Milton Keynes.
The air traffic controller was killed so that hundreds of people on the plane could avoid the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero after he helped a plane carrying hundreds of people take off at the cost of his own life.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing after a strong earthquake caused a tsunami on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong underground tremors continue to shake the area, many people found themselves under rubble in the city of Palu.
However, unlike his colleagues, who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower, which was heavily wobbly, at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was safely in the air.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
A spokesman for Indonesian air navigation service provider Johannes Searight said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian news agency ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which should take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are very sorry to hear about it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands as the country's disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sighi and Butong is limited.
“The death toll could rise as many bodies are still under the rubble and many of them cannot be reached,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
The waves, which reached a height of six meters, devastated the city of Palu, where mass burials will take place on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft deliver aid and food.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is not enough.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Ian Gelfand, chairman of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross of Indonesia is in a hurry to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes on the island of Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: as stated in Air Niugini, after the fall of the plane in the lagoon, one person went missing
The airline, which operated a flight that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now says one person has gone missing, although it has previously been reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said it could not find a single passenger as of Saturday.
The airline says its representatives are trying to find a husband and are working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to do so.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the passenger, for example, his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it tried to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane flew the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low above the ground.
"It's very good," said Janes.
Janes said that he and others managed to get to the emergency exits on a sinking plane while on the belt in the water.
He said that the stewardesses panicked and screamed, and that he received a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to modernize the berth also helped in the rescue operation, bringing people ashore with an inflatable boat before the plane sank at a depth of 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but Air Niugini is not on this list.
Analyst restored the chronology of the night in which the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution launched a case against a man accused of burning Mississippi women alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified as an expert in operational development for several hours.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to recreate the movement of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Rowlett, according to The Clarion Ledger, said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his previous claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was near Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the latter.
On Saturday, Sanford testified and stated that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in a Sanford pickup that night, Sanford said he was “lying because my pickup was in Nashville.”
Another discrepancy was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The phone records indicated that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He erased her from his life,” Gale said.
The defense has to present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip-Hop?
The trio of hip-hop artists wants to challenge the negative view of the genre, filling their music with constructive messages.
The group The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip-hop has changed its nature – it has abandoned political ideas and the struggle to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the origins and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed a revival of this trend in the United Kingdom thanks to groups such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
In New York, the nanny filed a lawsuit against the couple for dismissal, having received a "racist" message
In New York, the nanny filed a lawsuit against the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an incorrectly addressed message from her mother complaining that she was "another black woman".
The couple denies that they are racist, comparing the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lincy Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed concern when she saw that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, who arrived on her first working day in 2016, was black.
“NO, IT IS ANOTHER DARKNESS,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Morris.
According to the New York Post, realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plaxon-Flaxman felt "uncomfortable" and fired Ms. Morris. She stated that their previous nanny, who was African-American, did not do her job well and that instead she was expecting a nanny from the Philippines.
Ms. Morris was paid for one day’s work and then sent home on Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple, hoping to get compensation for the severance pay she would have received for six months of living with the spouse she was originally hired to work for, albeit without a contract. She was to be paid $350 a day.
“I want to show them that they shouldn’t do that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
In response to accusations that they were racist, the couple said that the dismissal of Maurice was a wise decision, as they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after being offended.
“My wife didn’t mean what she sent her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
“But would you leave your children with a person you treated rudely, even if it wasn’t intentional?
Your baby?
Backwards."
Comparing the lawsuit to “extortion,” Plasco said his wife gave birth to the child only two months ago and “hasn’t recovered yet.”
“Would you take revenge on someone after that?
It’s a bad thing,” the investment banker added.
While the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
According to a new letter, Padington’s publishers feared readers wouldn’t understand the idea of a bear that could talk.
Bond’s daughter Karen Yankel, who was born almost immediately after the book was agreed to be printed, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it’s published.
Now it’s funny, because we know about the huge success that the Padington story has had.”
Talking about how her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before a small toy bear inspired him to write a children's book, was optimistic that his work was rejected, she shared how on the 60th anniversary of the book's release she simultaneously felt "joy and sadness" because her father died a year ago.
Regarding Padington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family", Karen added that her father was quietly proud that the book had become so popular.
“He was a very humble man and didn’t like to brag,” she said.
"But Padington was so real to him, like his own child! After all, when children achieve something, we are proud of them, although these are not their victories, not ours.
I think that's how he saw Padington's success.
Although Padington is a creation of his imagination, he has always attributed success to him.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the 2nd Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where doctors unsuccessfully tried to save her life.
“Nad called regularly, said that everything was really bad, that she shouldn’t have done it,” Mrs. Eden-Laperouse said.
“And then Nad called me and said she was going to die within the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashie, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The medicines that the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating gradually stopped working and left the body.
She died some time before they were all turned off.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing what was going on at the time.
I couldn’t grieve, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold myself in my arms.”
Eventually, Mrs. Eden-Laperouse, grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, ignoring the severe trials she had to endure.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I put my head down and couldn’t hold back the tears.
It is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to deeply sympathize with Nada.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Two women who suffered grief leave leaflets to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys leave postcards on a Welsh bridge with phone numbers for people to call for support, as well as messages that they hope will inspire them.
Miss Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
“I don’t want other parents to feel the same way I do every day,” she said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Lydna, said that her son was a promising chef with an attractive smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that this smile made any room brighter.”
But he quit his job before he died because he was "as if in the dark."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11, found his brother’s body after he committed suicide.
Ms Davis says: “I’m constantly afraid that it will have consequences.”
Ms. Davis created the postcards “to let people know that there are people they can reach out to and talk to, even if it’s just a friend.
Don’t shut yourself up, you have to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, who had been friends with Ms. Davis for many years, lost her husband Mark, with whom she had lived for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was depressed, that he was depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he had changed.”
And on Christmas Day, he finally lost his mind. When the kids opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye or anything."
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to survive it: "It imposed a devastating

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance: the FBI begins an investigation
“I thought that if we could get what we asked for – limited in time and nature of the investigation – we might have reached some agreement,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “falling apart” amid a hopeless loss of loyalty to the political party.
Why didn’t Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is related to time.
The midterm elections will be held in just five weeks, on November 6. If Republicans are expected to have problems, this will seriously complicate their attempts to hold their own person through the elections to the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush telephoned the senators asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who had served in the White House under Mr. Bush, and through whom he had met his wife, Ashley, who had served as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to win at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to solve the problem with the same number of votes and approve his candidacy for the post of Supreme Court Justice.
During Kim’s rule, the number of defectors from North Korea “decreased”
Since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has declined, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Pyeong Seong, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of the Republic of South Korea, said that last year the number of defectors was 1,127 compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the key factors were the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that smugglers who transport illegals are now demanding more money for it.
In Pyongyang refrained from public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors eventually offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea. It is easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still formally at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang and discussed denuclearization, negotiations on which have stalled.
This happened after the June historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to cooperate on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of a lack of progress since then, amid sanctions.
“Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be confident in the security of our country, so in these circumstances there can be no question of unilateral disarmament,” Ri Yong Ho said in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi spoke in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I’ve been thinking all along that if a woman had ever acted this way, she would have been called ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi commented on her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and coughing, discussing his family and school years.
He also openly denounced Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him “absurd and coordinated reputational damage” orchestrated by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
According to Pelosi, Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, as it showed his biased attitude towards Democrats.
“I think that with these statements, as well as his speech against Clinton and the Democrats, he will personally withdraw his candidacy,” she said.
Pelosi was outraged when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if his guilt was confirmed, and whether Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll put it this way: If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not only not fit to serve on the Supreme Court, he’s not fit to serve in the court where he currently serves,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he was seen as a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh sided with the question of whether he would overturn some Supreme Court decisions.
“Now is not the time for a judge to be a hysterical, biased person and we’re going to tell you how wonderful that is,” Pelosi said.
Women should own these weapons.
These were fair words, which contained rage accumulated for months and years, and she could not speak them without tears.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued: “A woman who worked as an executive director somewhere and helped me a lot said that she also cried when she was angry, but she had her own technique. When she got angry and started crying, she told the interlocutor: “You might think that I’m sad and that’s why I’m crying.
I am angry.”
After that, she just kept going.
I thought it was incredible.”
Tears are considered an acceptable way out of anger in part because they are perceived differently.
One of my clearest recollections of my first job in an office that was mostly men was when I once wept in indescribable anger and an older woman, an unfriendly manager I had always been a little afraid of, grabbed me by the collar and dragged me to the stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sad, and they’ll be glad they got to you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught out of wedlock aboard a boat called the Monkey Business, after which he retired from the race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why she could not run for president.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the race, and another candidate is the last thing they needed.”
Someone called the situation “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since this was at the end of the campaign, she was behind in raising funds, so she made a promise to herself that she would not participate in the race if she did not collect $ 2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who did not spare the support of men $ 1,000, gave her only $ 250.
“Do they think they’ll give me a discount?” she asked.
When she gave the speech and announced that she would not run an official campaign, she was overwhelmed with emotions – gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system, which made it very difficult to collect money and forced her to focus not so much on voters as on members of the Chamber of Deputies, as well as anger at sexism. She was ready to cry.
“You’d think I was having a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalls of the press reaction.
You would think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
Was I still thinking about what they would write on my tombstone?
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the trade war between the US and China were desperate, and, although far from over, in the long run the split between the countries could benefit Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump made the first warning shots earlier this year, taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest increase this week comes from new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all U.S. goods from China.
Beijing has paid back the same coin every time, recently imposing duties ranging from five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to take similar U.S. measures, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to miss an opportunity to keep that promise any time soon.
Getting Washington to back down means accepting the demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, public worship of the US is too shameful.
However, experts believe that if Beijing takes advantage of the situation correctly, the pressure in the trade war with the United States can bring China an advantage in the long term, reducing the relationship between the two economies.
“A quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that will lead to a sharp economic fall in any of the countries. And this actually poses a greater threat than observers previously recognized,” said analyst Abigail Grace, who deals with Asia-related issues at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Foreign Minister says Syria 'ready' for return of refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help in rebuilding a country ravaged by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said conditions were improving in the country.
“Today, the real situation has become more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can return to normal life.
All conditions have now been created for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and limited their livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian government would be happy to accept help in rebuilding the war-torn country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that support the insurgency.
Europe secures victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018, when they defeated the US team with a final score of 16.5:10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has been defeated in Europe for the sixth time in a row and has not won a Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who struggled most of the tournament, punched his first long shot at the 16th hole of par-3 into the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds and became one of four players to ever pass 5–0–0 since the tournament began in its modern format in 1979.
American Jordan Spit defeated with a score of 5:4 from the player with the lowest rating in the European team of Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who occupies the first place in the world ranking, lost 2-1 to Jan Poulter from England, who may have participated in the Ryder Cup tournament for the last time.
Spanish Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, a veteran of the Ryder Cup, who has already participated in the tournament eight times, became the European who won the most tournaments of all time, bringing 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but there’s nothing I can do today.
It's been a tough year.
Thank you Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to return the cup.
This is the merit of the team, and I am happy that I was able to help,” said, not restraining emotions, Garcia after winning in Europe.
He passes the baton to his compatriot John Rehm, who on Sunday defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in a 2-1 singles game.
“I’m incredibly proud to win over Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy,” Ram, 23, said.
In France, Woods lost all four matches and now has a career record in the Ryder Cup tournament 13–21–3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 Major tournaments, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team attempted to reach the fairway area throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played upscale golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furick said of his team after the disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we briefly dominated Europe.
We fought.
I take off my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the U.S. Professional Golfers Association and the Ryder Cup Tournament Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be their captain.
You can’t praise them.
We lost."
Up-to-date information on the red tide: a decrease in the concentration in the districts of Pinellas, Manat and Sarasota
Florida’s Fish and Wildlife Commission’s latest report shows a general decline in red microbial blooms in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, the abundant flowering conditions reported in certain areas of Pinellas, Manat, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier counties indicate a decrease in concentration.
The flowering of red microorganisms extends for about 130 miles of coastline from the north of Pinellas to the southern counties of Li.
Spots can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but fewer than last week.
Red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, the average concentration in Pinellas County and its coastal zone was reported, the concentration from low to high in the coastal zone of Hillsborough County, the high concentration in Manat County, the high concentration in Sarasota County and its coastal zone, the average concentration in Charlotte County, and the low concentration in the coastal zone of Charlotte County, as well as its low concentration in Liaison County.
In the counties of Pinellas, Manat, Sarasota, Lee and Collier continue to report respiratory irritation.
No such reports were reported in northwest Florida last week.
