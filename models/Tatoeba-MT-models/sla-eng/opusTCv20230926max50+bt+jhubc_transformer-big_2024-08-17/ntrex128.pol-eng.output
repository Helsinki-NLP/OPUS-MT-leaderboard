Members of the Welsh National Assembly fear they will be called muppets
There was consternation among some members of the National Assembly, as a result of a proposal to change their title to Member of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
The idea arose in connection with the plans to change the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from all sides of the political scene are concerned that they may become the subject of ridicule.
One Labour MP voiced his group’s concerns, saying the new name rhymes with the Welsh words “twp” and “pwp”.
For non-Wales readers: in Welsh, the word “twp” means “fool” and the word “pwp” means “scum”.
One of the party’s politicians, Plaid Cymru, said his party was “dissatisfied” with the proposal and presented other solutions.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party was "open" to changing its name, but noted that the wording of the word "MWP" is very similar to the word "muppet".
In this case, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in the English dialect of Yorkshire.
The committee, which is currently working on a draft bill to change the name, took the following position: "Naturally, the final decision on the future title of members of the assembly will belong to them."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposal. The renaming of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament has gained wide support.
In addition, the committee supported the proposal to change the title of members of the assembly to “Member of the Welsh Parliament”, i.e. WMP in English, although the abbreviation “MWP” was most popular among the public.
The difficulties in reaching a consensus are a source of grief for Elin Jones, the assembly’s president, who is due to present a bill in the coming weeks.
The law introducing reforms will also take into account other changes in the way the assembly works, including the rules for dismissing members and the structure of the comitology system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title when discussing the bill.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Next Sunday, voters will decide whether their country will soon be called the Republic of North Macedonia.
A general vote is expected to help resolve a decades-old dispute with neighbouring Greece, which is home to a region called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long argued that the name of its northern neighbor is a territorial claim, and has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
<0xC7><0xB4>orge Ivanov, the president of Macedonia and an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would disregard the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the plebiscite, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change is necessary to enable the country to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells in New York's St. Martin's Church will be silent due to the problems affecting the churches in Harlem
“The older people I talk to say that in the old days, you could find a bar and a church on every corner,” said Michael Henry Adams.
“There is no trace of them now.”
As he says, the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“Right now, people are socializing in a different way,” he noted.
“Bars have ceased to be a place for regular meetings of community members.”
In the case of churches, however, he worries that the funds from the sale of property will not be enough for as long as the decision-makers believe, and that “sooner or later they will be at the starting point.”
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings inhabited by people who would not support the other surrounding temples.
He said: “The overwhelming majority of people buying apartments in such buildings will be white. This will accelerate the complete closure of churches, since it is unlikely that new residents will become members of these parishes.”
Both churches were built by a congregation of white worshippers before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (the Church of St. Martin joined the community a decade later).
The original assembly of white Methodists left the district in the 1930s.
A local African-American assembly then took ownership of the building.
St. Martin’s Church was taken over by a rally led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against sellers on 125th Street (the main shopping street in Harlem), opposing the hiring or promotion of African-Americans.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, however, the parishioners of John Howard Johnson made plans to rebuild the temple and commissioned the construction of a bell complex.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of John Howard Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the new carillon “the bells of the poor.”
The expert, who chimed the bells in July, described them as a “cultural treasure” and an “irreplaceable historical instrument.”
Tiffany Ng, an expert from the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first carillon in the world supported by a black musician. The artist was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to Riverside Church 18 years ago, where a larger team was waiting for him.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
In recent months, there have been a number of complex events in the church of St. Martin involving architects and performers. Some of them were brought into place by the secular leaders of the church, and some - the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the parish council (the governing body of the parish composed of secular leaders) addressed its concerns to the diocese, claiming that it “wants to pass the costs on to the council,” although the council did not take part in hiring architects and contractors sent to the site.
Some parishioners also complain about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old diving for lobsters in California
Authorities reported that last Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old diver in search of lobsters in California. The incident occurred on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the American city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported to KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he was diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard a cry for help. Immediately with a group of friends they came to the boy to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was excited to catch the lobster, but he soon realized that the baby was screaming, “I’ve been bitten!
I was bitten!”
Upon reaching the scene, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy’s skin was completely torn around the collarbone.
“I started screaming to everyone to run away from the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” he said.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego. His condition was determined to be critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During a press conference, the rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said that the fish had already been spotted a few weeks earlier. However, it was considered that it does not belong to the species of dangerous sharks.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper torso.
In order to conduct the investigation and for security reasons, the authorities closed the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours.
Larry Giles noted that the area is home to more than 135 species of sharks, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to expand operations in the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury’s is throwing a glove at stores such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, introducing in its supermarkets cosmetic departments referring to the style of department stores, as well as specially trained sellers.
As part of a significant investment in the UK cosmetics market – which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and is growing steadily despite declines in the fashion and household goods industry – 11 chain stores will have larger shelves of cosmetic products. If the initiative is successful next year, the activities will be expanded to further points.
The return to the cosmetics industry stems from the search for ways to develop the space previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and household goods.
According to Sainsbury’s, the network will double the number of cosmetic products and offer up to 3,000 items. For the first time, products from such brands as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw will appear in the assortment.
Currently sold L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees products will also receive more space and separate areas similar to those known from Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket chain plans to refresh its offer of Boutique makeup products. From now on, most of the articles will be vegan-friendly, which is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop perfumer will set up test points at two Sainsbury's supermarkets. The first opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second will be set up in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
The prevalence of online sales and daily purchases of small amounts of food in local stores means that supermarkets need to encourage customers to visit more.
Mike Coupe, chairman of Sainsbury’s, said points of sale will increasingly resemble department stores as the network tries to combat discounts such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and products other than food.
Sainsbury’s has placed Argos points in hundreds of stores and is introducing a number of Habitat points since the acquisition of both companies two years ago. According to the company, this is contributing to increased food sales and increased investment profitability.
The previous attempt to reorganize the departments with cosmetic products and pharmaceuticals ended in failure.
At the beginning of the 21st century, Sainsbury's created a joint venture with Boots for trial purposes. However, the cooperation was terminated after a conflict over the distribution of revenues from pharmacies operating in supermarkets.
Sainsbury’s is introducing a new strategy following the sale of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
According to reports, Lloyds will contribute to the plan by introducing an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four chain stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We’ve transformed the look and character of our cosmetics departments to improve customer experiences.
We have invested in special training for colleagues so that they can help consumers when shopping.
Our brands are able to meet all needs, and the friendly environment and convenient locations allow us to attract the attention of customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question the existing ways of shopping. "
Peter Jones ‘angry’ after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Peter Jones, the star of the TV show Dragons' Den, was "angry" when he learned that Holly Willoughby was going to pull out of the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million lifestyle brand to focus on a new collaboration with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Holly Willoughby doesn’t have time for their brand of accessories and household items called Truly.
The business has often been compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, the 37-year-old announced her departure via Instagram.
The sudden decision to leave a thriving lifestyle brand and focus on a new collaboration with Marks & Spencer and ITV by Holly Willoughby enraged Peter Jones, the star of Dragons' Den.
According to sources, Peter Jones was “angry” when a popular TV presenter announced during a nervous Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to new contracts worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, he would not have time to devote to their brand of accessories and household items Truly.
The company had previously been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was also set to double Holly Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
After announcing the decision to leave the Truly brand by Holly Willoughby, 37, on Instagram, Peter Jones left the UK for one of his holiday homes.
According to the source, “Truly was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She tied her future with it and wanted to take care of it for several decades to come.
The decision to withdraw completely surprised all those involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday. It was so close to entering the market.
The Marlow Warehouse is stocked with ready-to-sell goods.”
Experts believe that the resignation of the presenter of the program This Morning and one of the most successful stars in the UK can cost the company millions of pounds due to significant investments in products - including articles from pillows to candles to clothing and household goods - as well as lead to a further delay in entering the market.
It could also mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Holly Willoughby (mother of three) and her husband Dan Baldwin had a ten-year relationship with Peter Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Holly Willoughby and Tara Capp founded Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Peter Jones joined them in March as CEO.
The couple spent vacations together, and Jones held a 40% stake in Dan Baldwin’s television production company.
Holly Willoughby is set to become an M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Peter Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business matters.”
Difficult conversation, "and then we fell in love"
The president joked about the media criticism caused by the remark, which some considered “unbecoming of the husband of the state”, as well as a positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a mocking voice, pretending to be a TV presenter:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was hailed by Trump as a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament are being delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he did not see a “similar response” from the United States to North Korea’s early actions toward disarmament.
He noted that instead, the United States maintains sanctions and pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were planning a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now.”
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong-un had had positive effects: they ended missile tests, helped free hostages and helped bring the remaining U.S. soldiers home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when discussing relations with Kim Jong-un.
“It’s easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get into a crowded stadium, we’d have 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed one of the islands, killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the loss of a roof over the head by more than 10% of the inhabitants of Lombok, the authorities did not declare a natural disaster, which is a prerequisite for accelerating international assistance activities.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, the authorities have made it very clear that they are not asking for international support, so the situation is difficult,” Selina Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is preparing to travel to the Indonesian city of Palu, it is not yet clear whether international staff will be able to operate at the scene.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if assistance from international organizations should be allowed.
In the face of the shocks constantly felt in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared to deal with the forces of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh province, they are rare in the rest of the coastline.
The lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu – despite issuing a warning – likely had an impact on the death toll.
Even in the most favorable conditions, traveling between Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which was stationed on the island of Lombok, is on its way to Palu to help the victims of the earthquake, but it will take at least three days to reach its destination.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia’s infrastructure a major focus of his campaign and has allocated a lot of funds to roads and railways.
However, in the face of next year's elections, the presidential administration is struggling with a lack of funds.
In addition, Joko Widodo came under pressure due to the ongoing religious tensions in the country. Members of the majority Muslim community have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than a thousand people have been killed and tens of thousands of residents have lost their homes as a result of fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs using machetes, bows, arrows and other simple weapons in the streets.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores a goal for a draw in a match with Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the English Premier League, scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's match at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received an application from Xherdan Shaqiri at a distance of about 27 meters from the Chelsea goal at a 1: 0 state to the detriment of his team.
Before shooting in the direction of a distant goal, he shifted the ball to his left leg.
The ball swayed high above the penalty area towards the upper right corner of the net.
Then she fell into the gate, flying over the rushing Kep Arrizabalaga.
“I was just trying to get in position and take the ball, knowing that players like Shaqiri are always trying to take it as far forward as possible. I wanted to give myself the best shot possible,” Sturridge said in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
“I noticed Kante approaching, took the ball and shot without thinking.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the middle of the match after the goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard shot in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker kicked the ball heel to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> and then ran towards half of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> quickly accepted the application in the middle of the pitch.
Then he made a beautiful play forward into the penalty area back to Hazard.
Gambling overtook the defenders and left foot gave in the direction of a long post shot that passed Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00 at Stadio San Paolo in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
According to Indonesia’s disaster agency, the death toll from the recent earthquake and tsunami in the country has risen to 832.
During the conference, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported that as a result of Friday's 7.5-magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale, many people were trapped under rubble. In addition, the earthquake triggered a tsunami wave with a height of 6 meters.
Inhabited by more than 380,000 people, the city of Palu is full of rubble and collapsed buildings.

A monument to Cromwell in front of the British Parliament is the latest casualty in a dispute over “writing history anew”
The removal of the monument would bring justice for the Taliban-like actions to destroy many of England’s cultural and religious monuments by its radical, puritanical supporters.
However, the Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's proposal as "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “Given the ongoing debate over the removal of the monuments, it was only a matter of time before the Westminster Palace debate over the character of Oliver Cromwell.
Imaginative actions during the English Civil Wars were neither commissioned nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps for the actions of his ancestor Thomas a century earlier, it was decided to punish the wrong Cromwell.
The way in which Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft depicted Cromwell on the monument is a testament to the reputation he enjoyed as a politician in the 19th century and that for many people he is still a figure worth commemorating.
John Goldsmith said in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell was seen by many people – perhaps more often in the 19th century than today – as a defender of parliament against external pressures. In this case, of course, it was about monarchy.
The assessment of how accurate this statement is is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
It is certain, however, that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure identifying one of the sides of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be honored and commemorated.”
In China, there was a fatal beating of a farmer by a pig
According to local media, in a market in the south-western part of China, there was a fatal attack of a pig on a farmer.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found bleeding and with a severed artery near a pigsty in a market in the city of Liupanshui, in the province of Kueychou.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate in a pig farm on 30 May 2005, Xining City, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, the man arrived at the market with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, the cousin found the man’s body and noticed an open door to a nearby stable.
He said there was a big pig in the pigsty with blood on his face.
The cadaver section confirmed that it was a nearly 250-kilogram pig that killed the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and bruised,” said a man named Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
CCTV footage shows that Yuan arrived at the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Guiyang Evening News in an interview that while the evidence was being collected by the police, the piglet was isolated to avoid another attack.
According to reports, the man’s family and the authorities of the market are negotiating compensation for death.
There have already been cases of pig attacks on humans, although these are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, in Wales, a nearly 300-kilogram pig had pinned a farmer to a tractor.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by pigs in 2012, one farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can trigger violent behavior in them.
“They just want to have fun.
They're as inquisitive as children... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them proper respect,” he said.
Remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength, moving over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, it will cause heavy rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Hurricane Rosa blows at a speed of almost 137 km/h. On Sunday at 5:00 Eastern time, it was assigned category 1. It was then located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
According to forecasts, Rosa will move to the north on Sunday.
In the meantime, over the Pacific Ocean, it begins to form than heading east to the west coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will approach the California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, moving masses of humid air to the north, to the southwestern United States.
Monday will bring rainfall of up to 25 cm in part of the territory of Mexico.
In the coming days, the humid tropical air coming into contact with the approaching low will cause heavy rainfall in the Southwest of the United States.
In some places, rainfall of 2.5 to 10 cm will lead to sudden floods, movement of pollutants and possible landslides in desert areas.
The humid tropical air will cause somewhere from 5 to 7.5 cm of rain per hour. This is especially true for parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even 5 to 10 cm of rain is predicted in some areas of the Southwest, especially over a large part of Arizona.
Due to the diffuse nature of tropical precipitation, sudden floods and sudden changes in conditions are possible.
In the face of the threat of tropical rain, it is definitely reborn to move on foot in the desert area.
Abundant downpours can turn canyons into rushing rivers, and thunderstorms will cause local gusty winds and movement of dust.
Coming than will bring abundant local rainfall on the coast of southern California.
Rains with a total height of more than 1.3 cm are possible, which can cause small movements of pollutants and danger on the roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region at this time.
Transient tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday. On Monday afternoon and Tuesday, rainfall will occur in more areas.
Heavy rains will hit the Four Corners region in the western United States on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
In October, along with the cooling in the Arctic region throughout the United States, there may be temperature fluctuations. However, in the intertropical zone, it will be rather warm.
This can lead to rapid temperature changes over short distances.
A good example is the Sunday temperature differences in the central part of the United States.
Between Kansas City (State of Missouri) and Omaha (State of Nebraska) and between St. Louis (State of Missouri) and Des Moines (State of Iowa), these differences are almost 10 degrees Celsius.
In the coming days, the summer temperatures may rise again.
In much of the central and eastern United States, the warm beginning of October is expected. Temperatures should range from 26 to 32 degrees Celsius in the area from the southern part of the Great Plains to part of the Northeast.
On Tuesday in New York, the temperature can reach up to 27 degrees Celsius, which is about 5 degrees above average.
Long-term climate forecasts indicate a high probability of above-average temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s auditions
More than 20 million people watched on six television stations the moving Thursday hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, a woman accusing a lawyer of sexual harassment in the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political stalemate on Friday, commentators had to interrupt regular broadcasts to report a sudden reversal: an agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake, under which the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had groped her in a state of intoxication and tried to take her clothes off during a high school party.
In his emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said that he was convinced that such a situation had not happened.
It is possible that Friday’s number of viewers was even higher than the 20.4 million reported by Nielsen.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, the figures were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen typically has difficulty measuring viewership among people in the workplace.
The given number is similar to the viewership of the American football cup competitions or the American Film Academy awards.
According to Nielsen reports, Fox News Channel, whose presenters strongly supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, had the highest viewership. It averaged 5.69 million viewers during the full-day audition.
In second place was ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest in the subject remained high after the end of the hearing.
Jeff Flake became a key figure in Friday's events.
In the morning, he was caught by the cameras of CNN and CBS after the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he decided to support the nomination of Kavanaugh. On the recording, he yells at demonstrators who made it difficult for him to enter the elevator on the way to the hearing of the judicial commission.
Flake, with his head down, listened for a few minutes to unfavourable opinions, and the entire event was broadcast on CNN.
“I’m standing here in front of you and I’m asking.
Do you think he is telling the truth?
You have strength in the face of the impotence of so many women,” he said.
Before the elevator door closed, Jeff Flake said his office had issued a statement and that he would speak during the committee hearing.
Later, television stations continued to broadcast the events in anticipation of a vote to pass Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate.
Flake said he would only support the nomination if he knew the FBI would investigate the allegations next week, as a minority of Democrats insisted.
Flake was persuaded in part by a conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made the decision after meeting with Chris Coons and several other senators.
Flake's election was important because Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Brett Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of using Brexit to their advantage
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing the future of Britain and undermining the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside that of Theresa May on the title page, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson attacked a plan for future relations with the European Union in the wake of Brexit, under which the UK and the EU could levy duties on their behalf, calling it “completely ridiculous”.
Wayde Sims shot dead: police arrest Dytheon Simpson suspected of killing LSU fighter
Police arrested the suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player playing in the colors of Louisiana State University (LSU).
The Baton Rouge police chief, 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson. The police reported that during the fight, Sims lost his glasses.
According to the CBS-affiliated WAFB station, police officers found the glasses at the scene and found traces of Simpson’s DNA on them.
Police said after questioning Simpson that he confessed to shooting Wayde.
According to the lawyer, the amount of the bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The police command expressed its gratitude to the Louisiana State Police Search Group, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police, and nearby residents for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU’s sports director, thanked local law enforcement for “working hard and pursuing justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge and his father Wayne Sims also played basketball at LSU.
In his last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “heartbroken” and “shocked” by Wayde’s death.
“It’s one of those things we’re constantly afraid of,” said Will Wade.
The ash emitted by the volcano reaches the city of Mexico
The ash from the Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern districts of Mexico City.
On Saturday, Mexico’s National Disaster Prevention Center advised residents against approaching the volcano due to increased activity in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over a 24-hour period.
The center recorded numerous thumps and shocks.
Images posted on social media show car windshields covered in a thin layer of ash in Mexico’s neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Since the 7.1-magnitude earthquake that struck Mexico City in September 2017, geophysicists have recorded an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km southeast of the capital.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence referendum anniversary
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona as a result of clashes between pro-independence protesters and police preventive units. On that day, thousands of people took part in hostile demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the extremely emotional referendum on the secession of Catalonia.
A group of masked supporters of the separation threw eggs and powder paint at police officers. Dark clouds of dust enveloped the streets usually full of tourists.
The clashes also took place later in the day. In order to stop the fighting, the police forces used sticks.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "We don't forget, we don't forgive." Opponents of secession shouted "Long live Spain."
According to the local press, fourteen people received medical assistance in connection with minor injuries suffered during the protests.
After a year since the October 1 referendum, tensions have not eased. Although the authorities in Madrid have deemed them illegal, it is still a reason to celebrate for secession-seeking Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, but turnout was low due to a widespread boycott of opponents.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year in violent clashes with police trying to prevent them from voting in polling stations.
On Friday evening, groups of supporters of the region's independence decided to prevent a demonstration supporting police officers.
The demonstration took place despite this, however, the route was forced to change.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said there was no hope for Catalonia’s independence.
“Last year we had some of the best moments of our lives.
My parents cried for joy that they could vote. But now we are stuck at the point of no choice,” he said.
Despite a significant but small victory in the local elections last December, the parties supporting the secession of Catalonia are finding it difficult to continue their activities. Many of the most recognized leaders have decided to leave or are awaiting trial in custody in connection with the role played in the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a telephone protest supporting the police, said politicians on both sides of the dispute were fueling the conflict.
“The situation is becoming increasingly tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders held in custody since the end of last year, announced his intention to run in next year’s European Parliament elections.
“Candidating for the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the crisis in the democratic values of the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after entering the house by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after being hit several times by a car in a house in the town of Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Commissioner Bob Blemmings of the Investigative Department said the damage had affected the gate and the building.
At some point, a crossbow shot could also have been fired at the car.
Menga Goal Wins Livingston Over Rangers 1:0
The first goal of Dolly Menga for Livingston brought the team a victory
From that season on, Livingston stunned the Rangers with Steven Gerrard's second defeat in his 18 games as manager of Ibrox Park.
Dolly Menga's goal proved to be a winner, and Gary Holt's team moved to second place in the table along with Hibernian.
The team under the leadership of Gerrard remains this season without a victory on the road in the Premiership. Next Sunday, the team will face the leader of Hearts, to which he loses eight points.
Earlier, because on Thursday, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team in the UEFA Europa League.
Coach Holt has not been defeated since replacing Kenny Miller in the post last month, but he is expected to continue to play in the second half of the season.
Livingston missed several opportunities against indisposed opponents
The team led by Holt should have taken the lead much earlier, as the team's game gave the Rangers a lot of trouble.
First, Scott Robinson broke through the defense and shot into the light of the goal, but he failed to score a goal. Then Alan Lithgow did not hit after taking over the head of Craig Halkett.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play closer to the goal, knowing that they could threaten their rivals during the fixed parts of the game.
And this is how the decisive goal fell.
After the Rangers took a free throw, the Livingston team found an opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly created the situation for Mendza, who scored a goal from the center of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers had more possessions, however, they could not force the defense of the hosts and did not cause any major problems to goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
This pattern was repeated in the second half. Alfredo Morelos fired one shot at Kelly's goal.
Scott Pittman's attempt was defended by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow failed to hit the goal light from another permanent fragment in favor of Livingston.
The Rangers continued their attacks in Livingston's penalty area, but were unable to take advantage of the situation. They demanded two penalty kicks after Halkett's intervention against the substitute Glenn Middleton and one hand play. In both cases, however, the players' claims were rejected.
"Phenomenal" performance of Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Almondvale Park
Great performance and result for Livingston.
In his opinion, they played great, once again exceeding expectations.
Their style and composition have hardly changed since returning to the top flight. However, you should appreciate Holt for motivating the team to play.
This game had a lot of heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role, leading a well-organized defense. Menga, on the other hand, made Connor Goldson and Joe Vorrall throughout the game had to be very attentive.
The Rangers lacked the will to fight.
Although under the leadership of Gerrard they have great moments, in this match they did not maintain their standards.
Their game seemed to lack something: only once managed to break through the defense of the hosts. This should be a serious warning for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan’s visit to Cologne
During Saturday’s breakfast in Berlin (29 September), the leaders of Turkey and Germany were accompanied by smiles and beautiful weather.
This was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Differences in issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union have led to disputes.
After the meeting, Erdogan went to Cologne, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
The city has the largest number of Turks living outside its homeland.
According to police, a crowd of 25,000 gathered in front of the temple for security reasons, but supporters of the president gathered in the area to see their leader.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan – including many Kurds – also decided to express their opinion, condemning the policy of the Turkish leader and the decision of the German government to adopt a politician in the country.
The opposing protests reflect the divisions created by the visit of a politician hailed as a hero by some Turks living in Germany and recognized as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist died as a result of a collision with a car
The cyclist died after a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the crowded intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, a south-eastern district of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
After the incident, the driver stopped the vehicle, and medical paramedics arrived at the scene. Despite the intervention, the man died at the scene of the accident.
A few months ago, another fatal accident involving a cyclist occurred on Childers Street (about one and a half kilometers from the scene of the accident on Saturday).
The Metropolitan Police reported that officers are working to identify the deceased man and inform about the incident of family members.
Roads were closed and bus detours were arranged, and drivers were advised to avoid the nearby area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Riots
According to the authorities of the facility, six officers were injured as a result of riots in a penal institution for men with an increased level of security.
The riots at the HMP Long Lartin penal facility in Worcestershire began at around 9:30 a.m. UK time (BST) on Sunday and are still ongoing.
For the riots involving eight prisoners in one of the wings of the plant, a specialized unit "Tornado" was called.
Officers at the scene suffered minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the facility said: “A specially trained staff was involved in the action at the HMP Long Lartin penal facility.
Six officers suffered minor injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our facilities. We are confident that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
According to reports, in June, the plant director had to go to the hospital after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, the plant was called to the prevention units because of the dangerous riots, in which employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Sudden flooding caused by Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (possible beneficial effects on drought-affected areas)
It is rare for a tropical depression to reach the state of Arizona. This is likely to happen at the beginning of next week. The remnants of Hurricane Rosa move through the desert areas of the South West, posing a threat of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning about the possibility of flash floods Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to forecasts, on Tuesday Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix. On Monday afternoon, the rain will begin.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported via Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have sustained a storm or tropical depression at a distance of 320 km from Phoenix.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) came within 65 km of the Arizona state border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center forecast rainfall of 5 to 10 cm. In some areas, Mogollon Rim in Arizona can reach a height of up to 15 cm.
In other desert areas of the South West – including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin – rainfall is likely to be between 2.5 and 5 cm, and in some areas up to 10 cm.
For people outside areas at risk of flash floods, the rainfall accompanying Hurricane Rosa can bring relief as the region has been struggling with drought for some time.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some precipitation will improve the situation in the South West, where there is a state of drought.
According to weather.com, U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that nearly 40 percent of Arizona’s land area is experiencing severe droughts in the second-highest category.
Hurricane Rosa will first hit the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa continued to move with the strength of the hurricane, reaching speeds of up to 137 km / h. Currently, it is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is heading north at a speed of 19 km / h.
The hurricane encounters the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, causing it to weaken.
According to forecasts, it will hit Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Intense rainfall in some parts of Mexico can pose a high flood risk.
Weather.com reported that “from the California Peninsula to the northwestern part of Sonora state, rainfall is expected to be between 7 and 15 centimetres in height, although it can reach 25 centimetres.”
Then hurricane Rosa will pass through Mexico in the northern direction in the form of a tropical storm. On Tuesday, in the early morning, it will reach the border of the state of Arizona as a tropical depression. By Tuesday evening, it will travel to the southern part of the state of Utah.
“The most serious threat posed by Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is the very heavy rainfall in the California Peninsula, in the north-western part of the state of Sonora and in the southwestern desert areas of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center reports.
According to forecasts, rains will cause life-threatening sudden floods and the movement of pollution in the desert and mudslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested in attempted murder case
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on charges of attempting to murder a 16-year-old boy found stabbed in Somerset County.
The boy was found at Excelsior Terrace, in Midsomer Norton, on Saturday, at around 4:00 BST.
The victim was taken to hospital and his condition remains “stable”.
Police in Avon and Somerset said one 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officers ask to contact all persons with the recordings of the event.
Trump says Brett Kavanaugh 'experienced the ignominy and anger' of Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous conduct,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "felt the ignominy and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh testified before Congress. Strongly and emotionally denied the accusations of Christina Blasey Ford. The woman claims that a few decades ago, when both were teenagers, the man committed sexual assault against her.
Ford also testified during the hearing on the charges against her.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, "Americans could see the brilliance, class and courage" of Kavanaugh.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of support from one of the most distinguished lawyers of our time, an expert in the law and a great service to the community,” he told a crowd of supporters at a rally in West Virginia.
The president did not directly address the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, discussing the importance of Republican turnout in mid-term elections.
“We are five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
I don’t run in this election, but I remain very active,” he said.
“I’m still fighting to defend our great candidates.”
Trump says Democrats are pursuing a policy of “resisting and obstructing activity.”
As one of the assistants to an important Republican Party politician told CNN, the first key Senate vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia. The number of victims is growing
Authorities said on Saturday at least 384 people were killed — many of them kidnapped by high waves smashing into beaches — in the wake of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit Indonesia’s Sulawesi island.
On Friday in Palu, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to take part in a festival held in the city. At dusk, waves reaching up to 6 meters in height struck the shore, kidnapping many people and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was the result of a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
“When the threat arose yesterday, the people on the beach did not flee immediately and were the victims of the tsunami,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s BNPD disaster agency, told a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami attacked everything in its path, hijacking cars, logs and houses,” Nugroho reported, adding that before reaching the shoreline, the element was moving at 800 km/h at sea.
As he said, some saved themselves by climbing trees and managed to survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the disaster agency show many destroyed homes and shops, damaged and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was hit by aftershocks.
In the area inhabited by 2.4 million people there were a number of earthquakes.
According to the Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT), the energy released by Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement said the geographical location of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have exacerbated the effects of the tsunami.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He then added that the bodies of some of the victims were found under collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured, and 29 people are believed to be missing.
Nugroho said the fatalities and damage could be greater along the coastline 300km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which was closer to the epicenter of the quake.
According to Nugroho, the communication “has been completely paralyzed” and there are no reports from the province of Donggala.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that workers and volunteers from the organization were heading to disaster-stricken areas.
“We can already talk about the tragedy, although the situation may deteriorate significantly,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency met with widespread criticism due to the lack of information about the tsunami in Palu, but authorities said the waves came just after the warning was issued.
On an amateur video shared on social media, a man is seen screaming from the building, trying to warn about the upcoming tsunami of people on the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water smashed into the shore, hijacking buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused significant power outages, preventing communication within Palu, which in turn made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities say the military has begun sending transport planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport located in the city is open exclusively for humanitarian aid transports. The airport will remain closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo is due to visit the evacuation centres in Palu.
More than 800 tsunami victims in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
As reported by Doseba T. Sinai, the national director of World Vision, the staff of this organization arrived safely from the province of Donggala to the city of Palu and found shelter in tarpaulin tents placed in the courtyard of the office. Along the way, the workers passed many desolate areas.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some groups are slowly beginning to provide assistance, there have been criticisms that foreign aid workers with extensive experience are being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, the acceptance of financing, resources and personnel from abroad can only begin after the disaster site has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet been done.
"Officially, we are still dealing with a regional catastrophe," a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross said.
“When the government considers that there has been a national disaster, we will be able to start accepting international aid. But this has not yet happened.”
Two days after Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Palu, the friends and families of the missing continue to hope that their loved ones will somehow find themselves among the destruction.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the canals.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had spent two days under rubble next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders participating in the Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
According to Petra Mandagi, the other people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
“As an experienced paraglider, I struggle with my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon Subandono recounted how, within hours of the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel surfaced among the paragliding community, he was desperately sending messages via WhatsApp messenger to athletes participating in the beach festival.
His messages were marked with only one gray hook instead of a pair of blue hooks.
“It seems to me that this means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves Steal $26,750 While Replenishing Cash at an ATM at Newport on the Levee Mall
According to a statement from the Newport Police Department on Friday morning, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was refilling cash at an ATM at the Newport on the Levee mall.
“The driver of the car was emptying an ATM in the entertainment complex and preparing to replenish cash,” Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
Another man “runs from behind to a Brink employee” and steals a bag of money to an ATM.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not say how many people were involved in the theft.
All persons with information on the identity of the thief are asked to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West decided to change his name to Ye.
In announcing his intention on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote about himself: “A person formerly known as Kanye West.”
The forty-one-year-old musician has been using the pseudonym Ye for some time. It is also the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change took place before his visit to Saturday Night Live. The artist is expected to present his new album Yandhi during the performance.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the creators, refused to participate "for emotional reasons."
West has previously stated that the word “Ye” is not only short for its current artistic nickname, but has religious significance.
“It seems to me that ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In the Bible, it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, discussing the title of an album with a radio presenter named Big Boy.
“I am you, I am us, it is about us.
First I was Kanye, which means the only person. Now I am Ye – a reflection of all our good, bad and confusing qualities.
The album shows who we are.”
West was among other famous rappers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, nicknamed Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West collaborator, also wrote his pseudonym in various ways, with a hyphen, no hyphen, and capital letters.
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador pledges not to use military force against civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody suppression of student demonstrations, Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador (AMLO) pledged never to use military force against civilians.
On Saturday, L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador vowed to “never use the military to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on the square in the direction of a peaceful demonstration, killing up to 300 people. The event occurred at a time when leftist student movements were beginning to develop throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has pledged to support young people in Mexico by providing monthly financial aid to students, as well as creating more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people towards criminal groups.
The U.S. Should Double Funding for Artificial Intelligence Research
According to Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and expert in artificial intelligence working for Google, Microsoft and Apple, as China’s activity in this area increases, the United States should double its spending on AI research.
The remark is related to the announcements on artificial intelligence published by various US government agencies, despite the fact that the US does not have an official strategy on AI.
Last year, China unveiled its plan to become the most innovative country in artificial intelligence by 2030.
“First, we need to double the budget for AI research: all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area,” said Kai-Fu Lee.
In an interview with CNBC this week, he also said that doubling the funds could double the chances of making another breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book, AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the president of Sinovation+ Ventures.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University to create an AI system that defeated the best American player in the game Othello. He then held a managerial position at Microsoft Research and was the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee acknowledged the success of previous US government technology initiatives, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) competition for the most interesting robot projects. He also asked about the date of the next edition of the competition, because according to him it will help to find future visionaries.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
“It’s not China that takes away our best academics, it’s the corporations,” Lee said.
For several years now, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring prominent scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States in the development of AI.
“I think that people with artificial intelligence who have received a doctoral degree should automatically be given a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council published a plan to create the next generation of artificial intelligence.
As Lee noted, China’s National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to members of academic institutions in a manner similar to the U.S. National Science Foundation and other government organizations giving funding to U.S. scientists. However, the quality of academic activity in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to engage industry and science partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA also announced a $2 billion commitment to an initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation currently invests more than $100 billion a year in AI research.
At the same time, the American initiative aimed at creating a national commission on the security of artificial intelligence has not moved forward for months.
Macedonians Vote in Referendum to Change Name of Country
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia. This movement would allow to avert a decades-old dispute with Greece, which blocks the country's efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, home to Macedonia's historic landmass, maintains that the northern neighbour's name is a claim to its territory, and has therefore vetoed the country's accession to the EU and NATO.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on naming, but nationalists say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority living in Macedonia.
President <0xC7><0xB4>orge Ivanov said he would not take part in the vote. The campaign to encourage a boycott raised doubts about whether the turnout will reach the minimum level of 50% required to make the referendum binding.
The referendum asked the following question: “Do you support joining NATO and the EU following the adoption of an agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying the price for the possibility of joining Macedonia – one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia – to such organizations as the European Union or NATO.
“I voted for the future of my country so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union. EU membership will ensure greater security for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have declared that they will respect the results of the vote.
The name change requires the support of two-thirds of the members of parliament.
The state election commission said no unusual events had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout at this hour was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the eligible people cast their vote.
“I voted because of my children. Our place is in Europe,” said <0xC7><0xB4>osze Tanewski, 62, a voter from Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in the town of Strumica, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duszko voted in a referendum on changing the country’s name to open the way to NATO and European Union membership.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov prepared a small stage and set up chairs in front of tents set up by people boycotting the referendum.
“We support membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join these organizations with the head held high, not the back door,” Kawardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China or Russia and become part of the Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority will support the name change in the referendum, because 80% of citizens support the European Union and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He said the “yes” vote was a “confirmation of our future.”
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Public Research, 30 to 43% of voters declared their willingness to participate in the referendum. This is less than the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian TV Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote in Sunday’s referendum.
70% of respondents said they would support the name change.
For a vote to be successful, the turnout must be 50% + 1 vote.
Failure to do so would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government since it took power in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero defeats Brighton's entire defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent home Brighton's defence in Saturday's 2–0 match for Manchester City. The match was played at Etihad Stadium in Manchester (England).
The goal scored by Aguera in 65 minutes looked childishly easy.
The action began with the delivery in the middle of the pitch to the Argentine striker.
The player has overtaken three defenders of Brighton.
Then Aguero was among the four Brighton players.
First, he played one of them, then overtook the others and found himself on the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
Then he played the ball to the left, where Sterling was waiting for her.
The English striker immediately handed the ball back to Aguera in the penalty area, who defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the goal.
“Aguero is suffering from a foot injury,” Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about the possibility of playing 55, 60 minutes.
And that's exactly what happened.
We were lucky to have a goal at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Blues their first Premier League lead.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In this action, Aguero received the ball deep in the middle of Brighton.
He sent a great pass along the left side of the pitch to Leroy Sane.
Sane made several moves, allowing Sterling to move to distant posts.
The Manchester City striker pointed the ball at the net just before it fell on the cars.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55. The meeting will be held at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to ruin the chances of winning the Rockies
After losing a chance to play in the playoffs by the Washington Nationals, Scherzer did not have to appear in the first line-up.
However, the rival Scherzer hopes to play in Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, if only the Rockies retain the chances to perform in the playoffs. Currently, the team has one more victory than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West division.
The Rockies can count on at least a wild card if they win Friday’s game against the Nationals with a score of 5:2. However, they still want to get their first division champion title.
“Even though we’re playing for nothing, at least we’re going to go out on the pitch, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the performance of the opponents will be at the highest level, as in the rest of the season.
Why wouldn’t I want to be in this meeting?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a starting pitcher for Sunday's meeting, but the team is leaning towards putting Scherzer in the first line-up.
This would be Scherer's thirty-fourth appearance in the first squad. The player took part in Thursday's kick-off training and hopes to perform on Sunday.
The right-handed pitcher of the Washington team scores 18-7 and the ERA 2.53. 300 times eliminated batsmen and scored 220 and 2/3 rounds in a season.
Trump rally in West Virginia
Trump did not directly address his appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, discussing the importance of Republican turnout in mid-term elections.
“In November, we are putting all the achievements so far on the line.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
Although I do not start, I remain very active. I constantly defend our great candidates" — he said.
He went on to say: “We are dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats. We see their actions with our own eyes.
They're determined to take power by any means necessary, and they're mean and malicious.
They don’t care who they hurt or who they have to hurt in order to gain power and control. Taking power and control is their goal. But we will not give it back to them.”
As he said, the Democrats are pursuing the mission of “resisting and obstructing activity.”
“It’s been very good to see this in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “bad, mean, nasty and untrue.”
The president referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, recalling the name of the U.S. Senator from the Democratic Party Dianne Feinstein, which was met with a loud roar from the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for the leak?
“Uh, are you listening?
No... I mean... no." Her body language was fatal. It was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerant of people expressing their opinions
When the Momentum activists in my party voted to reprimand me, I was not surprised.
After all, I am a member of a group of Labour MPs who have recently been told that they are not welcome, all because of their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the request for reprimand was based on a difference of opinion between me and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences concerned the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe. Ironically, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders on these issues.
In Friday’s announcement of the Labour MPs’ meeting in Nottingham East, one could read: “We want the meetings to be open and productive.”
In my eight years as a Labour MP, most of the General Committee's Friday afternoon meetings looked like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings today are held in a different way, and the promise of a “kinder and gentler” policy has long been forgotten, if ever it was remembered.
It is becoming more and more obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party. Each opinion is evaluated in terms of compliance with the leadership of the party.
It all started shortly after Jeremy Corbyn took over as chairman. My colleagues, who seemed to me to have similar views, began to expect me to change direction and take positions that I would not have agreed with before. They concerned issues such as national security or the EU's single market.
After every public appearance – regardless of the content – I encounter on social media attacks calling for the rejection of the nomination, the condemnation of centrism or the abandonment of the Labour Party.
This is not just my experience.
I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are rather political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience sexist or racist treatment every day, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current policy is the transition to an agenda of insulting others.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views. With every request for a “vote of no confidence” and every change in the rules of choice, the party’s worldview is narrowed.
Over the past two years, I have been repeatedly told not to stoop and keep quiet about certain issues, and then everything would be “okay.”
That’s not why I took up politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student as a result of Margaret Thatcher’s government’s negligence that led to the collapse of my school class, I have strived to provide a better quality of public service to those in need – both as a local councilor and as a minister.
I never hid my convictions, even during the last election campaign.
Everyone in Nottingham East knew my position and the differences of opinion with the party authorities.
To those who supported Friday's proposal, I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the Labour leader in the face of an impending Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services.
The most important message, however, is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents (both Labour and the rest): I am proud to serve you. I promise that no threats of rescission or ad hoc political objectives will deter me from acting in accordance with my convictions and in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr vs Melrose 38:17 – undefeated Ayr again tops
Two late touchdowns may have somewhat distorted the final result. However, there is no doubt that the Ayr team deserved to win this extremely interesting match of the Scottish Extraliga.
The team was in first place in the table and remains the only undefeated team.
In the end, the outstanding defense and better use of opportunities led the host team to victory. Coach Peter Murchie could be pleased with his charges.
“The matches so far have been a challenge for us, but we are still undefeated, so I am happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “We have to respect the players of Ayr. They have taken better advantage of the opportunities that are coming up than we have.”
Ayr took the lead in the 14th minute after putting on Grant Anderson and raising Frazier Clim. However, a yellow card for the Scottish Rory Hughes, who came to the team from the Glasgow Warriors, allowed Melrose to equalize the score when Jason Baggot caught the ball up after an unused chance.
Climo increased Ayr's lead after a penalty kick just before the end of the first half. First, he scored a touchdown, and later took the chance of a raise, scoring 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose started the second half well. Patrick Anderson's touch-up raised by Baggot reduced the loss to five points.
Then there was a longer suspension of the game due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott. The player was removed from the pitch on a stretcher. After the resumption, Ayr increased the lead after the application of Stafford McDowall and the elevation of Clim.
Melrose re-used its size: a touchdown with an unused attempt to raise Bruce Colvin reduced the lead, and the team's captain, Ayr Blair Macpherson, was given a yellow card.
The hosts took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for knocking down Clima without the ball. MacPherson scored a touch on the back of the approaching defense.
Climo took advantage of the opportunity to raise the score. Then again he managed to raise the score just after the resumption of the game, when Kyle Rowe caught a shot from the penalty kick and allowed wingman Gregor Henry to score a fifth touchdown for the hosts.
The star of the series Still Game begins a career in the catering industry
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game series, seems to be starting out in the catering industry. Recently, it was discovered that he became the director of a restaurant management company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC sitcom, co-starring and co-creating the series with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the history of the series. All indications are that Ford Kiernan is already planning a future after leaving Craiglang.
According to official data, he became the director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan was trying to get involved in Glasgow’s “developing food industry.”
"The sea belongs to us": Bolivia, deprived of access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the area around the Navy base in La Paz.
There are blue flags flying from public buildings.
In the ports of the navy from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, there is the following motto: “The sea is ours by law.
It is our duty to get him back.”
In a landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody conflict over 19th-century resources is still vivid, like a dream of re-navigating the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the highest in several decades. Bolivia is awaiting a judgment from the International Court of Justice, due to be issued on 1 October after a five-year trial.
“Bolivia’s actions are gaining momentum. Residents are unanimous, optimistic and counting on a favorable verdict,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will be watching the International Court of Justice meeting together. They hope the Hague-based organization will acknowledge Bolivia's claim and, after decades of fruitless talks, Chile will have to enter into negotiations to grant the country independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic president who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, is also hopeful in Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
Some analysts, however, say that the chances of a favourable ruling for Bolivia are small and that even a favourable decision would make little difference.
The United Nations body based in The Hague does not have the authority to grant Bolivia the territory of Chile. It also stipulated that it would not affect the arrangements for possible talks.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, the decision of the International Court of Justice will be issued six months after the presentation of the final arguments. Such a short time shows that the case "was not complicated".
Unfortunately for Bolivia, the past four years have been able to push the country away from its goal.
"The issue of access to the sea has been appropriated by the current Bolivian administration," Paz Zárate said.
Morales’ relentless rhetoric deprived Chileans of any remnants of goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but this will be very difficult in the face of the situation.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, former president and representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed with the view that the court's decision-making process was extremely fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a unique opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the possibility of "ending a 139-year period of disputes with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — used the subject of access to the sea as part of a political game.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“A verdict is an excellent opportunity to convince ourselves that we have to deal with the past.”
North Korean leaders say nuclear disarmament will not take place until they can trust the United States.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation will never get rid of nuclear weapons as long as it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two countries.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming suspended nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says it’s “frozen” that the failure to lift sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War has ever brought North Korea to its knees.
Washington does not want to agree to sign the declaration without Pyongyang taking concrete disarmament steps.
Both Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump want another meeting.
There is widespread skepticism, however, that Pyongyang is serious about dismantling the arsenal, which is seen in North Korea as the only means of ensuring security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in preparation for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows herald the emergence of the latest line of great headwear in clothing stores.
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely hide from the sun, then we have good information for you.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of crazy, oversized headgear included in their summer collection for 2019, which dazzled with style during Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats topped Instagram this summer. The aforementioned designers decided to present their stunning creations on the catwalk.
An outstanding work of Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide, feathery round watering the heads of models.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons adorned with jewels, a wizard’s hat, and even a pineapple —but they weren’t designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a number of strange masks — just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their mouths sewn together and resembled Hannibal Lecter's style more than haute couture.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment with a tube and glasses, and another looked like melted ice.
And if you don't want to break with great fashion, you're in luck.
Style watchers predict that huge hats may end up in clothing stores.
The undersized hats follow just behind “La Bomba,” a 61-cm-wide straw hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind this extremely impractical hat, which spilled through social media, presented another great creation on the catwalk - a straw beach bag almost as large as the model wearing it in a swimsuit.
The burnt orange reef bag, finished with fringes from the reef and topped with a white leather handle, stood out in the Jacques La Riviera collection for the summer season 2019 during Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, star stylist, told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to hit stores next summer — because the designer has managed to make such a big impact, it would be hard not to capitalize on the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: language skills necessary for the world's citizens
Independent schools in Scotland are constantly enjoying their academic achievements – in 2018 they could boast of further excellent exam results, supported by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other social endeavors.
Represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), the schools, attended by more than 30,000 students across Scotland, aim to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen career path and to indicate their role as global citizens.
As an educational sector with the ability to develop and implement a curriculum tailored to the needs of the school, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable subjects to choose from in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to another person in a language they understand, it goes to their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.”
This is a clear reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last exam this year show that languages occupy the first place in league rankings, with the highest pass rates for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher grade of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students received a higher A grade in Mandarin, and 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners, and 63 percent of Spanish learners also received an A grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, language learning, as elective subjects, is conducted in the same scope as STEM (Scientific Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects within the framework of curricula in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 per cent of job vacancies were caused by a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming a necessity to prepare young people for the start of their professional careers.
These skills are essential in a globalised world with a growing number of jobs requiring language skills,
Lifelong learning skills, like learning a second language, will provide a huge advantage in the future —regardless of the career path taken.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person in relation to the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults, 75% of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French was the only language with a double-digit rate of 15%.
That is why investing in foreign language teaching is so important for today’s children.
Knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding suitable employment.
In Scotland, every school will be different in terms of the languages it teaches.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the UK in the 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of the child, in independent schools there will always be many languages to choose from, which will be taught by specialized teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed – no matter what the future holds for them.
Currently, it cannot be denied that in the international business environment, languages are still crucial for the future of the country, and so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be treated as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth a wide range, diversity and level.
That's just the way it should be.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's debut with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans who want to see LeBron James debut in the Los Angeles Lakers have finally seen it.
Luke Walton, the Lakers coach, has announced that LeBron James will play in Sunday’s pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"More than one, but less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudell, a Lakers reporter, said on Twitter that James is likely to play an incomplete number of minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season Lakers games.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need to be in pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Trump's election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned Trump-led election rallies that will take place next week, along with stops in his friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote confirming his suspension from the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking to build support in the upcoming mid-term elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the vote is cast in November.
What time is Trump’s election rally in West Virginia tonight, and where can you watch it online?
Trump’s election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place today at 7 p.m., on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump’s election rally in West Virginia will be live-streamed on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week’s hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which took place in a tense atmosphere over allegations of sexual misconduct, as well as the Senate’s anticipated vote to suspend the election for a maximum of one week, for the duration of the FBI’s investigation.
However, the main goal of this series of election rallies is to support Republicans facing difficult November elections.
So President Trump’s campaign with five rallies next week aims to “mobilize volunteers and supporters to help Republicans protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is such an important point in the president’s schedule that as the campaign’s hottest season approaches, he will visit as many states as possible,” said Trump’s campaign spokesman, who declined to be named.
Today’s rally at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could draw supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania,” as well as media attention from Pittsburgh’s West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia — a state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016 — for the second time in a month.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is losing in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey when the president comes to support him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: United States team shows fighting spirit, holding out hope of winning Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursome format held on Saturday afternoon could have been what Ryder Cup needed.
The rocking pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sports concept, but one that athletes really believe in, and most of all in competitions such as these.
So what does their momentum look like at the moment?
“They had six points and now they only have four, so I think we have a little bit of momentum,” Spieth said.
Europe, of course, leads by four points, while there are still twelve to be won.
Americans, Spieth says, however, feel the wind in their sails and have worthy role models, especially Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them could boast of scoring three points out of four.
Spieth is dangerous in all areas and gives an example.
Throat screams, a sign of excitement, became louder during his round, sinking a key putt and winning the match when he and Thomas scored two holes in two strokes.
His reflection on the ground, which gave them a victory with a score of 15, met with a similar cry - one that makes it clear that the American team is still in the game.
“You just have to focus and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left of each of these players.
18 holes to win.
The only players who scored more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but charming couple of the European team won four of the four and was not mistaken.
Moliwood is the only couple who didn’t score a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
The way the game is played and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the noisy crowd proves that these players need to be defeated on Sunday, and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari who could seal a potential European team victory at Le Golf National.
It would be best if they played on different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of fourball, when he was paired with Alex Norén.
Bogey and a double to the front of the Nine kicked the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they would never get out of.
There's no one on Sunday to help us get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t, and how a change of strategy can happen in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and gained a significant advantage on the last day, but the foursome session also showed that the US team has a knack for fighting, which some, especially in the US, doubted.
Europe with a score of 10-6 includes the lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning with the result of 10-6 Saturday's fourball and foursome matches with the United States.
The inspired duo – Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari – took the charge, taking two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods, increasing their previous score at Le Golf National to four points.
European team Thomas Bjorn, trying to keep the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the incomplete American team in the morning fourball format, winning the series with a score of 3-1.
The United States put up more resistance in the foursome format, winning two games, but could not make up for the losses.
To retain the trophy, Jim Furyk’s team must score eight points out of the 12 singles that will take place on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while with Molinari (the band was named "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend) they are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in four opening games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball format in great style, they defeated pumped Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau, achieving an even more empathetic score of 5&4.
Woods, who had struggled through two Saturday games, occasionally showed glimpses of genius, but had lost 19 of his 29 games so far in fourball and foursome formats, seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning fourball format, returned to Henrik Stenson in the foursome format, to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka — occupying positions 1 and 3 respectively in the world ranking.
The European team, however, did not have everything in mind on this pleasant, cool day in a field south-west of Paris.
Three-time top winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
They scored a decisive 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourball format and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with a 4&3 in the foursome format, losing two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has the team made up a four-point loss by starting singles, although Furyk's team would only need a draw to keep the trophy.
However, taking second place two days ago, a Sunday counterattack seems rather unlikely.
North Korea says "strongly no" to unilateral disarmament without confidence.
North Korea’s foreign minister said Saturday during a speech at the United Nations that the failure to lift sanctions only deepens North Korea’s lack of confidence in the United States and there is no way the country would unilaterally give up nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the site of nuclear tests and committing to non-proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we don’t see any concrete response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security, and in such circumstances, there can be no unilateral disarmament of North Korea.”
While Ri echoed well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s reluctance to take a “gradual” approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking action gradually, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearization, as it has in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between the incumbent U.S. president and North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim Jong Un pledged to work for the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump promised security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea expected a formal end to the Korean War (1950–1953), but the U.S. mission announced that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, even opposing signing a ‘declaration of end to the war,’” Ri said.
“The belief that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the dream of people who behave ignorantly towards us.
The problem, however, is that the failure to lift sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, which the U.S. leader spoke about earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, he drew attention to three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea was a party to denuclearization, not the United States, then there was no such deadlock in the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”
The tone of Ri’s speech was completely different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s missiles into U.S. territory was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim Jong Un a “rocket man.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened the “total destruction” of North Korea, praised Kim Jong Un for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but also said there was still much work to be done and said that until North Korea was stripped of its nuclear weapons, sanctions would not be lifted.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a time limit, saying, “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue and be sustained until we find full, final and verified denuclearization.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stifle funding for Pyongyang's nuclear program and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly forum and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his latest visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, after which North Korea condemned him within hours for “placing gangster demands.”
North Korea pledged this month at a meeting with Moon Jae-in that it would dismantle the missile test site and the nuclear complex if the United States took “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim Jong Un had told him that the “appropriate measures” he cared about were the security guarantees Trump pledged in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course on a sufficiently long rest
A new course at Harvard University, which took place this year, provided all students with more sleep, which was aimed at combating the growing macho culture, which consists of learning by “all-night caffeine-fueled students”.
Academic students from the best university in the world often have no idea about the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
To create the course, he was inspired to give a speech on the impact of sleep deprivation on science.
At the end of the speech, a girl came up to me and said, “Why am I being told this now that I’m in my final year of college?”
She said that no one had ever told her about the meaning of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which took place for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help achieve good academic and sports performance, as well as improve the overall well-being of students.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health service, said the course was decided to introduce after it was found that students suffered from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes an image of a dorm room where students click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise, and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, as well as how important it is to maintain sleep regularity.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have a right to know — just as everyone has a right to know what the health effects of smoking are.”
A culture of pride in “all-night science” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students means a growing problem of lack of sleep.
“Providing enough good quality sleep should be a ‘secret weapon’ for students to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, and even avoid gaining weight because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, making the student constantly hungry,” he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped develop the course after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus-wide course.
The next step, according to him, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar program of study before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm to remind them when to go to sleep and when to get up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and lead to problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga takes down Gerrard's team
The Rangers once again suffered during the fight on the way out of Livingston, when Dolly Menga with his shot led to the defeat of the dismantled team of Steven Gerrard, scoring 1-0.
The Ibrox Stadium team wanted to record their first win since a 4–1 victory over St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard for the second time in 18 games, causing his team to score eight points against Ladbrokes Premiership leader Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers' lack of commitment did not seem to improve.
While the Rangers dropped to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third — just behind Hibernian with a one-goal loss.
The Rangers team may be in further trouble due to the necessity of dressing the head wound of line judge Calum Spence after he was hit by an object thrown from the guest stands.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which allowed him to overtake Ayr and advance to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, in turn, went through with the same Livingston eleven that took a point from the Hearts team last week, being delighted with the way his well-trained team tortured their opponents every step of the way.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but it was Livingston who did more with the ball when they got it.
They should have scored in just two minutes, when the first lay of the ball by Menga allowed Scott Pittman to face Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder did not take his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then addressed a deep free throw to Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate Alan Lithgow, who played in the defensive position, could only remain in the back position.
The Rangers regained control in the third quarter, but it looked as if they had more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he deserved a penalty kick fifteen minutes before the end of the game when he and Steven Lawless ran into each other, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's claim.
The Rangers were only able to fire two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
While Livingston's 34-minute goal opening game may have been against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the very effort put into winning it.
Again, the Rangers couldn't cope with Jacobs' deep, solid piece of the game.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm, passing to Menga for a simple finish to the action.
Gerrard did not vacillate in the break and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent — this exchange almost immediately influenced the wingman who threw the ball into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block it, running from his position.
The Livingston team continued to draw guests into the game exactly as they liked it when Lithgow and Halkett performed long passes one after the other.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the last minutes, but McGregor took a good stand against Jacobs, after which Lithgow pushed the game out of the corner.
Ranger backup Glenn Middleton had once again hoped for a penalty kick when he got mixed up with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning edition of Almanac: September 30, 1882 — 136 years ago... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has become part of both science and pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, in which these seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans performed:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter that’s used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.

A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” hostile cells.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Hostile Cells and Destroy Them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize enemy cells as part of treatment.
This method is to extract the immune cells from the patient and change them in the laboratory.
Then they can "see" the protein common to many cancers. Then they are re-injected into the body.
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognise hostile cells had ovarian cancer that had gone away for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing the immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting these cells into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that this vaccine is working very well.
HER2 “drives the growth of several types of cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to locate cancer cells worked in the treatment of a kind of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a pro-Trump diatribe on Saturday Night Live with a MAGA hat on.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was “pumped” in the studio during Saturday Night Live after praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third piece that night, titled Ghost Town, during which he was wearing a hat with the words “Make America Great,” he issued a statement against the Democrats and re-expressed his support for Trump.
“Every time I talk to white people, I hear, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s racist!’
If I cared about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL program began with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before a Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault charges brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, a recording of West's speech was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known if Rock wanted to make fun of West by posting a post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that behind the scenes he had problems with his hat.
“They caught up with me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on.
They're after me!
And then they say I don’t have a choice,” he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Are you saying I have no choice?” adding, “I’m going to put on a superman’s cloakroom so you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Let's accept each other."
His words caused the audience to “buzz” twice, and the SNL team looked embarrassed, reports Variety. A person in the studio at the time said: “There was a grave silence in the studio.”
West was invited to the show in place of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West intrigued many with the performance of the song I Love it in the guise of a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: “To one of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR BEING MAFIA.”
Karen Hunter, a talk show host, said on Twitter that West was “just being himself, and it’s absolutely wonderful.”
“However, I will NOT reward a person (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their ‘art’) who, I believe, accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are also free,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he was now “formally called Kanye West.”
However, he is not the first artist to change his name – he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A friend of the rapper, Snoop Dogg, adopted the name Snoop Lion, and the music legend, Prince, changed the name to a symbol, and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder in stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after stabbing a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is due to appear before the Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington tackles the issue of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the medieval HBO series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor struck at the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that showing such roles on screen often makes young boys think they have to act tough to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, admitted he felt “quite confident” about the issue.
“Personally, I feel pretty confident at this point — where did we make a mistake on the subject of masculinity?” he said.
“What did we teach men as they grew up, from the perspective of the problem we now face?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the development of toxic masculinity due to the portrayal of very masculine characters.
He continued: “What attitudes are innate and what are learned?
What does he learn on TV and in the streets that makes young boys think they have to stand on a certain side to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time — what can be done to change that?
It’s clear that not everything is right with young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not play any more Game of Thrones prequels or sequels after the series ended the following year, saying that he was "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard’s True West, which is a story about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers getting to know his wife Rose to be the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
“On set I met my wife, which provided me with my future family and a new life,” he said.
In this award-winning Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte — the object of love interest of the character played by Kit, Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China sees 14 percent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected, according to the country’s health workers.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, meaning a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been almost completely reduced, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared to year-to-year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Given the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease result from insufficient protection when having sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to combat the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her team members leaked Republican senators’ data — “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theory.”
U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters on Saturday rejected allegations that a member of her team posted the personal data of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the above-mentioned lawmakers.
A member of the Los Angeles Democratic Party said the allegations were made by experts and websites linked to “far-right wings.”
“Lies, lies, and even more vile lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on the Capitol during the hearing of a panel in the Senate on allegations of sexual offenses against the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came some time after three senators challenged Kavanaugh’s candidacy.
Conservative parties such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to Waters’ office and published information about a Waters team member, Hill said.
“This baseless allegation is completely false and it is a 100 percent lie,” Waters continued.
“A member of my team – whose identity, personal data and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations – was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless allegation is completely false and it is a 100 percent lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly drew criticism online, including from Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary.
“This kind of denial is wrong,” Fleischer wrote.
“It suggests she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they can’t be angry.
He can't provoke.
He cannot question the motives of the accuser.
For this, he must remain calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of showing excessive anger during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“It’s a big deal if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said her office had notified “the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent allegations.”
“The perpetrators will be exposed and held legally accountable for all their actions that pose a threat to any member of my team,” she said.
Johnny English: Knockout – A Spy Parody with Weakened Rowan Atkinson
Searching for references to Brexit in each new British-themed film has already become the norm. This seems to apply to the new part of the series of action and comedy films "Johnny English", which began in 2003 with the film "Johnny English" and which returned to cinema screens in 2011 with the film "Johnny English: Reactivation".
Will the self-deprecating satire about how hopeless we are become the country’s new export commodity?
In any case, forever surprised, characterized by a rubber face, the incompetent Johnny English again received a license to party — his name more than anything else signals that he is an extensive, comic product designed for non-English viewers.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre taste for smoothie glamour, has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a pinch of Jas Beans, and a drop of this guy adding one note to the melody of the lead theme of the Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In the past, he was also a traveler and a world-class mystery man — Atkinson once starred in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, in which he left chaos behind.
In the latest Johnny English film series, there are one or two moments worthy of attention.
I really liked the scene where Johnny English was approaching the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, while the rotor blades beat rhythmically against his helmet.
The screen clearly shows Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy, but the sense of humor seems to be quite low-key and unnecessary, especially since now also “serious” movie brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible offer comedy elements as part of the film.
The humorous elements seem to be aimed at children rather than adults — I don’t think Johnny English’s crazy adventures are as inventive and coherent as the gags in Atkinson’s silent films about Jason Beans.
It has always been the current assumption that the UK is in serious trouble.
Cyberhacker infiltrates the British super-secret network of spies, revealing the identity of all British agents operating in the field - to the horror of the agent on duty, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a small role.
This is the last straw in the Prime Minister’s bitter spell, which is a pompous, wasted character already suffering as a result of a nervous breakdown caused by a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything in her power to play Theresa May, but the script does not give her the ability to spread her wings.
Her advisers from the intelligence agency inform her that due to the disclosure of the identity of all active spies, she will have to restore one of the retired agents to service.
And that means the inept Johnny English himself, currently employed as a teacher at some classy school, giving unofficial lessons on how to become a secret agent — a few nice gags while giving English spy lessons.
English is summoned to Whitehall for a briefing, reconnecting with his former sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a connection to the submarine commander, a cheerful but somewhat tired character played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin, in the secret service of Her Majesty, return to action, encountering the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, a character played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously overpowered by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems – the sinister Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their crusade of absurd situations: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they bring chaos by sneaking aboard a luxury Volta yacht; and English wreaks havoc while using a virtual reality kit to explore the interior of Volta’s home.
In this last sequence, all restrictions disappear, but despite the nice and loud performance, the whole film is very similar to children's television.
Typical average.
As with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
The Labour Party has denied that it is developing a plan that would give Britons a four-day work week, for which they would be paid five days' pay.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would see Britons work four days a week and get five days’ pay.
The party reportedly wants CEOs to pass on the savings generated by the AI revolution to employees, giving them an extra day off.
Thanks to this, employees could enjoy a three-day weekend, receiving the same amount of remuneration.
Sources say that this idea will “fit” into the economic program of the party and the plans of the country to meet the workers.
The transition to a four-day work week was supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from the change in the economy.
A senior Labour member told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that a policy change will be announced before the end of this year.”
“It will not happen overnight, but the four-day work week is something that fits into the party’s approach to restoring economic balance for the benefit of the worker, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support such an idea — the Green Party has pledged to introduce a four-day work week during the 2017 election campaign.
At present, however, these plans are not supported by all members of the Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day work week is not a party policy and its introduction is not considered by the party.”
John McDonnell, the Chancellor of the Shadow Cabinet, used last week’s Labour Conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “faceless CEOs” and “speculators” in public utility companies.
The Chancellor’s plans from the shadow cabinet also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not regain their entire stake, as the Labour government could make “deductibles” based on detected abuses.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and set up integration equity funds to transfer 10 per cent of the equity of private sector companies to employees who receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer the question of whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh can make them change their attitude
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the question of whether the Bureau’s findings could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview with 60 Minutes on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could discover something that could change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened when that allegation came up, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, decisive and unequivocal.”
Graham’s opinion, however, seems to be forged in stone.
“I have made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and to change it requires a strong allegation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett flatly denied it,” Graham added, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people he gave me could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t think anything will change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed in any way to reducing poverty?
Next Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York City, an annual music event boasting an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission – to end poverty in the world.
The seventh Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people coming to the Central Park Great Lawn to not only enjoy the performances of such stars as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the realization of the most important goal of this event, which is the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of anti-poverty activists by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless it was decided to purchase a VIP ticket), concert participants had to complete a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or other meaningful activities to help raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But what successes can Global Citizen boast of in the perspective of the 12 years remaining to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to take action, or another case of so-called “clictivism” when people feel they are doing something important by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Global Citizen says it has seen more than 19 million “actions” by supporters of the campaign since 2011, aiming to achieve a wide variety of goals.
These actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and regulations worth more than $37 billion, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, under which at least $ 10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the measures have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to “helping children reach their full potential,” which has pledged to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after Global Citizen members sent more than 4,700 tweets.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizen members like you, we can make social injustice like malnutrition a thing of the past,” Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, said during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after implementing more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the quality of maternal and child nutrition, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional problems.
One of the most frequently asked questions on their website was, “How can we be sure that extreme poverty will be eradicated?”
Global citizen responded as follows: “It’s going to be a long and difficult road —sometimes we stumble and fail.
But as with the once great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the stars performing at this year’s event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Could Use Navy to ‘Block’ Russian Energy Exports — Home Secretary
Washington may “if necessary” resort to its navy to prevent Russian energy from flowing into markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke-Washington Examiner has revealed.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government — is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate in the energy trade, as is the case in Eastern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, through its navy, has the ability to make sure that sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, create a blockade to ensure that their energy does not hit the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the “energy consumer voice” in the United States.
He also compared Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that in reality they are the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less about using and replacing fuels," he said, comparing Russia to a "pig who knows one trick" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements come as the Trump administration continues its mission to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe — a much cheaper option for European consumers than Russian gas.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump has made Berlin a “slave” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s ardent opposition to the project is purely for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The position of the United States provoked a violent reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I think it’s a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator, said she would consider running for president in 2020.
Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator, said on Saturday she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidacy.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the broken government, and that includes women in the highest office,” she said.
“After November 6, I will consider my candidacy for the presidency.”
During the meeting, Warren mentioned President Donald Trump, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has openly expressed her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren voters do not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters choosing the “probably” option said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick’s candidacy — 38 percent of people supported his potential candidacy, and 48 percent of people were against it.
Other well-known names from the Democratic camp taken for granted in relation to a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin Talks About Traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSD) Track Palin at Donald Trump’s Election Rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he has to go through when he comes back, I understand other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are coming back with,” she told the audience at Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her son’s arrest “a taboo subject,” and said of her son and other war veterans: “They come back a little changed, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if they will be shown respect for what their fellow soldiers, airmen and all the other members of the military have given their country away.”
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, soliciting false testimony in a domestic violence report, and possession of a drunken weapon, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the fight against the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed an amicus curi<0xC3><0xA6> letter in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker struggling with the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the lawsuit Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent sons of the gang" had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys for the aforementioned states, supporting Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be processed on the basis of concrete facts and circumstances, and such a ban violates this principle,” the letter said.
Prosecutors went on to argue in the letter that policies denying immigrants entry harm the U.S. economy, arguing that they could become entrepreneurs and “become an indispensable workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or because of belonging to a particular social group or having such and not other political beliefs,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11 on asylum policy.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems—even the serious ones—that people around the world face on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu as the death toll has doubled in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming more and more tragic.
“It’s a very intense feeling,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her fever-stricken son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute the ambulance brings in bodies.
“There is a lack of clean water.”
Residents were seen returning to the destroyed houses, searching through water-soaked things and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, quickly overflowed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured spine and arm, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside for severe secondary shocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted the violent earthquake that shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I think I’ve been pushed into the rubble of the wall,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then her voice went quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of “harassing” propaganda ads.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the paid China Daily supplement on the Des Moines Register — Iowa’s most popular newspaper — accusing China of trying to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections — a charge that China denies.
Trump’s allegation that Beijing tried to meddle in the U.S. election confirmed what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new stage in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads promoting trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington are now escalating a trade war that has led to tariff hikes on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were meant to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa — a major exporter of agricultural products to China — said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad stated in an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register that China “is now starting to harass with double force, putting propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the respected American tradition of free speech and a free press by placing paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“There will be no dissent in the Beijing street newsstand and no true reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese may have about the troubling economic direction China has taken, given that the media is under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most famous newspapers refused to publish" his article, though he did not say which newspaper.
Republican women with the right to vote face off in midterm elections over Kavanaugh affair, analysts warn
While many leading Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several sexual assault allegations, the analyst warns that these members will meet during the upcoming midterm elections with a violent reaction, especially from women.
The emotions associated with this event are extremely high, and most Republicans already officially want to vote.
“This cannot be undone,” said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University.
Reeher said he had doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s (Arizona) last-minute effort to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday — they will not forget it tomorrow and they will not forget it until November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to a Washington-based newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted the slogan “November is coming,” demonstrating in the Senate lobby over the decision by Republicans overseeing the Judiciary Committee not to withdraw Kavanaugh’s nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
“The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond scale,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
“People say he was already tall – and it’s true.
But it can be higher, especially among undecided suburban women and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she detailed her allegations of sexual assault against a Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that if Republicans decided to approve the candidacy, it could be met with a violent response.
“The Republican Party has to deal with a lot of mess,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it’s also about how Republicans handled the situation and how they treated Ford,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided as to who to trust in the face of Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with the latter receiving slightly more support.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents strongly or rather believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they strongly or rather believed Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38% of respondents said that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied when testifying, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI has launched an investigation into the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified last week under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her under the influence of alcohol at the age of 17.
Ramirez says the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals while attending Yale University in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet in order to compete with the platforms of Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that creates on the basis of the open source platform — Solid — owned by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which individuals have access to specific information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt was "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said, referring to the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow people to create their own “webshop with personal data” or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in one browser and at the same time.
A unique feature of an online store with personal data is that it completely depends on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide resources, processes, and relevant skills to help make the Solid platform available to all people.
Currently, the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world have been able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a total change that will overnight turn all of their business models upside down.
“Don’t ask for permission.”
In a post on the Medium platform, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to deliver trade and ecosystem energy to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been heavily involved in the net neutrality debate.
Announcing Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely excited to be thinking about the next era in network development,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Order of the Cross of Victoria during the First World War
The memory of the only clergyman of the Church of England, who was awarded the Victoria Cross as a combatant during World War I, was commemorated 100 years later in his hometown.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann was decorated on 29 September 1918 for his attacks on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had been awarded the highest British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said the unveiling of the stone on the 100th anniversary of his grandfather’s award was “extremely symbolic.”
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion through the Canal Saint-Quentin "in a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns".
He then hurried to the line of fire and, with "greatest courage" led her forward, then single-handedly attacked the field guns' position, disabling three of them.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I would never have been able to handle, but something humble at the same time.”
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he laid a wreath at the end of a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to be able to take part in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support he receives from many people."
MMA fans didn’t sleep through the night to watch the Bellator 206 gala, instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine that you didn’t sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206 gala packed with emotions, and eventually you couldn’t see the main fight.
The San Jose gala program included 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the fight, viewers in the UK were shocked by the change of program to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after not sleeping until the early hours of the morning specifically to see this fight.
One Twitter fan described the switch to a children’s cartoon as “some kind of sick joke.”
“According to a government regulation, this type of content is inappropriate to play at 6 a.m., requiring a change to the children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Pepp's pig, yes."
Bellator’s president, Scott Coker, said they would work out a timetable to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“When I think about a repeat of the situation, I think we can fix it,” Coker said.
“But it’s Sunday at six in the morning, so we won’t be able to deal with it until Sunday according to our time, and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a change in the program, we were bombarded with a lot of comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it was not a defect, it was a legal issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen again.
We will limit the program to five fights instead of six — that is, to a standard amount. We wanted to please the fans too much, and unfortunately we overdid it.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'worse' because of sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic water jumper, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize that not everyone was like him until he went to high school.
In the Desert Island Discs program on Radio 4 hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The usual host of this broadcast for many years, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
Appearing on the show for the first time hosted by Laverne, Daley said that growing up, he felt “less valuable” than others because “the simultaneous liking of boys and girls was not socially acceptable.”
He said, “To this day, this feeling of being less valuable and being different is something that gives me the strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove he was “something” so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a vocal activist for the LGBT community and used his performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he chose to express himself because he felt happy, able to live openly, without any implications, and wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said falling in love with the man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – had “surprised” him.
Daley married an Oscar winner (who is 20 years his senior) last year, noting that the age difference was never a problem for him.
“When you go through so much at such a young age,” he meant his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father’s death from cancer three years later, “he said that it was difficult for him to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June. Daley said that his perception of certain things has completely changed.
“The most important thing for me last year was to win a gold medal,” he said.
“And you know what? There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn’t accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked was whether they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics — he wanted to take place in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to be with us to be in the front row, Dad,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing. Only when he stopped breathing and died did I realize that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
“I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life — jumping into the water in front of a crowd of people at the Olympics — it was the best feeling possible,” he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first song, "Proud" by Heather Small, which accompanied him in the run-up to the Olympics and continues to give him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Showing Mickelson's lack of form on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
Phil Mickelson will set a new record on Sunday for his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to work on his form to keep his mark.
Mickelson, who played for the twelfth time in the two-year event, was sent back to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as often happened in his case with the United States team, the five-time main winner had to spend a day cheering the team and working to improve his game in hopes of fixing the reason for his return to the bench.
The 48-year-old, who has never given the simplest blows, even at the peak of his career, does not do very well on the tight field of Le Golf National, where wrong strokes are mercilessly punished by long roughs.
And if the pitch itself isn’t discouraging enough for Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday he must face the precision of the British Open winner, Francesc Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans (with a loss of four points at the beginning of the 12 singles) start the game with verve, the game of Mickelson can turn out to be extremely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player — there was nothing else he could do.
“He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, embraced me with his hand and said that tomorrow he would be ready,” Furyk said.
“He is very sure of himself.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to the game of his bands both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought there would be more of them, but that's how it happened, and that's how we had to do it.
He wants to play all the time, just like everybody else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could spell the end of his career at the Ryder Cup, which never matched his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, and Furyk said his presence has brought a lot to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, funny, and it’s good to have him in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had a good time with him this week, which was nice to see.
He brings with him so much more than just a game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a large point advantage may soon shrink
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point advantage before starting singles on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
The Danish made his debut in 1997 in a match at Valderrama, where he and his teammate, Vice-Captain Seve Ballesteros, had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but missed the finish line by the shortest hair possible, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“We can’t forget that we had a big advantage on the Valderrama field; we also had a big advantage on the Brookline field, where we lost, and in the case of the Valderrama field, we only won by a hair’s breadth,” Bjorn said, in the photo, after winning the 5-3 Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday, which gave a 10-6 lead on the Le Golf.
Time will tell me and the rest of the team that this is not over.
You're doing your best tomorrow.
Get out there and do everything right.
The end will be only when points appear on the board.
We have a goal, which is to win a trophy, and we have to focus on that.
I’ve said from the beginning that I’m focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we also know who the people on the other side are – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn, delighted with how his players have handled themselves in the difficult field, added: “I couldn’t have done it better.
But tomorrow is different.
Tomorrow they start singles, and that's another matter.
It’s good to play with your partner when things are going well, but when you’re playing alone, your golfing skills are tested to the limit.
This is the message that you need to convey to the players, is to give everything tomorrow.
The partner also has to do their best.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will expect his players to perform better on their own than when playing with a partner, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced a major turnaround on the last day, being a member of the winning team on the Brookline field, after which he was defeated after the European team made a “miracle on the Medinah field”.
“I remember every word,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, warmed up to his players on the last day.
“Tomorrow we are playing 12 important matches – you would like to start the game at a fast pace, as it was in the fields of Brookline and Medinah.
If this momentum goes one way, it will put a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We set up our line-up and set up the boys in a way that would allow us to enchant tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned the task of leading the counterattack, facing Rory McIlroy in the main match, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter — other European team players in the front half of the program.
“I chose this group of guys in that order because I think they’re going to do well in the whole game,” Bjorn said of his singles choices.
New German warship delayed again
The German Navy’s newest frigate should be commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but it won’t be until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new frigate of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but due to problems that arose after delivery, it was necessary to make changes to this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
Of course, they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as technological solutions that prevent detection, ensuring, among others, the reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic traces.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenance periods — it should be possible to operate new frigates for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, the constant delays mean that these modern warships, which are designed to allow the Germans to respond to situations abroad, will be obsolete at the time of starting their service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 appeared on the front pages of newspapers last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media reported a number of key "software and hardware flaws" that rendered the ship useless in combat missions.
The software flaws were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships were to be manned by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the size of the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is much too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the possibility of the Navy to carry out future modernizations.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project — including crew training — also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering level of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), while the initial cost was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with putting the new frigates into service are taking on particular significance in light of recent warnings that the strength of the German naval fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament’s defence committee, admitted that the navy “is running out of usable ships.”
He also said that this problem has increased over time due to the decommissioning of old units without the provision of replacement ships.
In addition, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wurttemberg class could be included in the navy.
The National Trust overhears the secret life of bats
A new study conducted at a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to show how bats use the landscape to obtain food.
The findings are expected to shed new light on the conservation of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The research, led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will focus on common and small dwarfs, as well as brown long-eared bats and red-nosed bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
At key locations around the property, special recorders will be deployed to keep track of bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out field tests using portable detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings is aimed at determining the frequency of signals sent by bats and the behavior of individual species.
Then a habitat map and a report will be developed to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, as well as the best ways to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that have an impact on perches and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can also pose a threat, as can fly glue and some chemicals used in building materials, and even domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more helpful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to search for worms and obstacles in their path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly carry out tests, inspections of the nest, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organisation has even established Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve on the grounds of the Three estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
David Thompson, the manager of the estate, says that it is ideal territory for bats.
“Threave has a great area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and great habitats.
However, there are still many unknowns when it comes to bats. The work we do here and on other estates will help us to better understand what they need in order to thrive.”
It stresses the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance work on the estates, as the unintentional destruction of one nest can kill up to 400 females and young, which can lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected —it is illegal to kill, harass, or disturb them, as well as to destroy their foals.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer with the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species we don’t even know how their populations are doing.”
Ronaldo dismisses rape allegations as his lawyers plan to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the allegations of rape against him as “fake news,” saying people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers intend to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
A Portuguese Juventus striker has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
According to Der Spiegel on Friday, the footballer was to pay the woman $375,000 for her silence.
A few hours after the charges were announced, Ronaldo, 33, described the reports as “fake news” in a live Instagram message to his 142 million followers.
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today’s news is fake news,” said the five-time Golden Ball winner.
“They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's nothing new.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of my job.
I’m happy and everything is fine,” the footballer added with a smile on his lips.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue the magazine Der Spiegel in connection with the allegations, which they called “unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy protection,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer will seek compensation for "moral damages in the amount corresponding to the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the footballer’s room, where he allegedly raped the woman anal, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was “99 percent a good guy” who was seduced by the “one percent.”
According to the documentation, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but this was done by mutual consent.
Mayorga also says she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and "public humiliation."
The 34-year-old says she now wants to void the settlement because she still can’t forget the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to Juventus after paying <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million for him.
Brexit: UK ‘would regret for all time’ car manufacturers’ departure
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain would “regret it forever” if it were to lose its status as the world’s leading carmaker after leaving the European Union, business minister Greg Clark said on Wednesday.
He added that he was “concerned” when a Toyota UK representative told the BBC in an interview that if the UK left the EU without a deal, production at a factory in Burnaston near Derby would be temporarily halted.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
A spokesman for the Japanese carmaker said the effects of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job cuts.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March without a deal, then there will be a halt in production at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Other British carmakers fear leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW is going to close its Mini car factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns, according to car manufacturers, relate to the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of the UK leaving the European Union without a deal.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be obstacles at the border, which industry officials say could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota said it would not be able to survive more than a day without deliveries to its Derbyshire plant, halting production.
Clark said Theresa May’s plan for a future relationship with the EU was “precisely designed to avoid border controls”.
“We need an agreement. We want to achieve the best possible agreement that will not only allow us to enjoy the current success, but also allow us to take advantage of this situation,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“The statements made by not only Toyota but also other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue what has been a very efficient set of supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to say for how long production would be halted, but warned that in the long run additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness, leading to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is a board member of the union’s trade union organization Unite, said the union’s members are increasingly concerned: “I know from experience that if jobs are eliminated, they will never be reinstated.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, White House says
An important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” because of the ongoing battle for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the possibility of Russian interference in the election, links between Trump’s close associates and Russia, and the president’s potential obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thereby threatening Mueller’s independence, has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from office under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the reports.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports that he was to resign.
The meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was set for Thursday.
Trump said that he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein. There was a postponement of the meeting to avoid collusion with the hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, during which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for this meeting has not yet been set, it may take place this week, and it may be postponed for another week, taking into account all the events related to the Supreme Court.
We’ll see, I’m sure I’ll inform the press about it.”
Several journalists questioned this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The show’s host, Chris Wallace, asked about the reason for this.
Sanders said the small number of press conferences is not due to an aversion to “ostentatious” TV journalists, adding: “I will not hide that they are “ostentatious.”
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The current president is conducting more Q&A sessions than any other president before him,” she said, adding without providing evidence: “We’ve gotten to know the numbers.”
Press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if journalists have the opportunity to directly ask the president of the United States questions, that’s a much better solution than talking to me.
We are trying to do this on a regular basis, and we have done this very often over the last few weeks, and press conferences will give way to sessions where you can talk directly to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions as he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why this is the case, acting too casually and sometimes bizarrely in front of the assembled journalists.
Health Minister Writes to European Union Workers Employed by NHS Scotland Faced with Brexit Concerns
The Minister of Health has sent a letter to staff from the European Union countries employed in the Scottish health service to convey their gratitude from the country and to ask them not to leave after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before Britain leaves the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of processing settled status applications for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “Negotiations on the UK’s exit from the European Union continued over the summer. The relevant decisions will be taken in the autumn of this year.
The UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal exit.
I know this is a very troubling time for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
“Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes surgery as a result of a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers' Christion Abercrombie underwent surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's Vanderbilt Commodores game, which ended in the Tennessee team's 31-27 defeat, according to Mike Organ.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the Tennessee State team, told reporters that the player suffered an injury shortly before the end of the first half.
“He went to the side line and then he fell to the ground,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline, then placed him on a stretcher and carried him out for further study.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details yet as to the nature/size of the injury,” and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (a second-year student dismissed from representing the college for a year to train his skills) plays his first season with the Tennessee State team after a transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday before the end of the match he had five charge, which gives him 18 charge throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
According to the new plans of the Tories, buyers from abroad will be charged higher treasury fees for the purchase of real estate in the UK. The funds obtained in this way will be used to help the homeless.
This move is intended to nullify Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract a young electorate.
The tax hike will apply to people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury Department estimates that it will receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreigners buying property in the UK will be charged a higher stamp duty, and the additional funds obtained will be used to help the homeless.
This move is seen as an attempt to offset Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises of cheaper housing and to increase the burden on higher earners.
Higher tax rates will apply to individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK. Additional measures are to help the government in the fight against homelessness.
The additional fee —in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago for other houses and apartments purchased for rent — can be as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to generate up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by residents of other countries, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult to buy the first house or apartment.
Since many foreigners buy property and spend most of their time outside the country, many affluent regions —especially the capital— have become “ghost towns.”
The new rules come just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big developers of maintaining high property prices by occupying the area, but not using it. He also called on Prime Minister May to lift the limits of cheap housing in order to eliminate the “housing scandal” in the UK.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including the regulation of rents and the end of evictions “for no reason.”
It also wants to give local governments more authority to build new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said that as Prime Minister I would be committed to rebuilding the British dream of making the lives of each generation better than the last.
It also means repairing our shaky housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can just as easily buy real estate here as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become very distant, but the humiliation of having to spend the night on the street remains all the more real.”
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest ambition is to be Scotland’s coach’
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's coach at some point.
This 42-year-old Scotsman is committed to the recovery of the North-East club, which currently ranks third in League One with a three-point loss to the best team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only managed to get to the B team,” Ross said in an interview with BBC Scotland’s Sportssound.
“As a child, I often watched Scotland matches with my father in Hampden and I was always drawn to that.
But that will only happen if I succeed as a manager.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland coach included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former coach Alloa Athletic says he doesn’t feel intimidated by taking on the role after such prominent personalities at such a large club, having previously rejected proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Now the success for me will be measured by whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
Given its structure and the facilities at its disposal, it undoubtedly belongs there,” he adds.
“It’s not going to be easy, but I’ll probably feel like I’ve been successful here, just on the condition that I succeed.”
Ross’ coaching career has only lasted for three years. Before that, he was an assistant coach at Dumbarton and for 15 months he belonged to the Hearts coaching team.
He then helped Alloa advance again after relegation to the third division, and in the following season led the St Mirren team from the brink of relegation to the championship title.
Jack Ross says he feels much more comfortable now than when he played in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“That was a real turning point,” recalls Allo’s tenure as coach.
“I really believed that leading a team was much better for me than just playing.
It will sound strange, because as a player I managed, made good money and achieved some measurable successes.
However, playing is a heavy piece of bread.
Every week you have to go through different situations.
They still meet me when it comes to stress and pressure related to the work of the coach, but I feel good in this role.
I've always wanted to train others and I'm doing it now, and I can say that right now I feel the most in place in my adult life."
The full interview at Sportsound can be heard on Sunday, 30 September on Scotland Radio between 12:00 and 13:00 BST time
Studies show that the best time for beer is 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave caused a sharp influx of customers to British pubs, but it was reflected by hiccups in restaurant chains.
The study found that in July, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, from CGA, said: “Continuous heat and longer than anticipated England’s participation in the World Cup has resulted in July’s results being similar to June’s, when pub turnover increased by 2.8 percent, with the difference that restaurant earnings fell even more.
The 1.8% decline in restaurant sales in July increased further in June.
The pubs and bars offering drinks fared best — their sales growth exceeded the decline recorded in restaurants.
Pubs serving food also suffered during the heat, though not as much as the restaurant owners.
It seems that people were just thirsty.
Beverage sales in managed pubs and bars rose 6.6 percent this month and food sales fell three percent.
Paul Newman of RSM, an entertainment and tourism analysis company, said: “These results are in line with the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The most important factors affecting the volume of consumption "outside the house" are the weather and large sports or social events.
The fact that restaurant chains are going through difficult times is not surprising, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to the previous year will have particularly severe consequences, given the constant pressure to reduce costs.
The long and hot summer has come at the least favorable time for food service owners, and time will tell whether the slightly more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring much needed respite.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including those newly opened, stood at 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand growth.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion. It sets recognised industry standards.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
Studies have shown that one in five children — some as young as 11 — have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed an increase in the number of “fake Insta” pages
The news has raised fears that the content posted on it is sexual.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “major” account that they show their parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 years old – set up social media accounts that they do not disclose to adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed a rapid increase in the number of “fake Insta” accounts — the name refers to Instagram, where you can share photos.
The news has heightened concerns that these accounts are used to publish sexually explicit content.
Twenty percent of students admitted to having a polite “main” account that they show to their parents, and they also have private accounts.
One of the mothers who happened to come across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter met a teenager who was urging others to “rape her.”
A study conducted in independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of students between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, half of which admit to maintaining private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of HMC, said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are creating their places online where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of athletes” on the board of Scottish Athletics
During the annual general meeting of the management of Scottish Athletics, Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board as a non-executive director.
Eilidh Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete, and Ian Beattie, the president of the Scottish Athletics Association, described the move as a great opportunity for those who manage the sport to benefit from the wealth of international experience she has gained over the past decade.
“Eilidh is highly respected by the Scottish, British and global athletics communities and we are confident that bringing her on board will bring great benefits to Scottish athletics,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m very happy to be able to give the council the voice of the athletes, and I hope to be able to really help manage the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who among his four Olympic gold medals has victories in the 200 and 400 meters at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, and now regularly appears in the BBC in the role of an expert, can not walk as a result of a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell if I would regain my fitness and to what extent.
It was torturing work, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again and returned to training!
Thank you for all your words of support!”
Lactator advertising, which compares mothers to cows, excites extreme emotions on the Internet
A lactator company has caused a storm on the internet by posting an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to milked cows.
To announce the launch of “the world’s first silent under-clothing lactator,” its manufacturer, Elvie, has released a mock-up ad in the form of a music video that highlights the freedom it gives mothers.
It depicts four real mothers dancing in a hay-filled barn to a song in which you hear the words: "Yes, I'm milking, but you can't see the tail" and "As you might have noticed, it's not just my tits that she's swapping out."
The refrain goes like this: “Pour them out, pump them up, feed the children with it, pump them up, pump them up, milk my mistresses.”
The ad, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused a lot of controversy on the Internet.
The film currently has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many of them say that it is inappropriate to joke about the “horror” that takes place in the dairy industry.
“Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like humans, to give milk, they have to get pregnant and give birth to a calf, except that their babies are taken away from them after a few days from birth,” one user wrote.
Elvie's lactator can be worn undetected under the feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: “This is obviously traumatic for both the mother and the child.
Sure, let’s use cows to advertise lactating mothers who can keep their babies.”
Someone else added, “This ad is completely detached from reality.”
Others defend the clip — one of the women said that in her opinion the song is “fun”.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would buy one.
When I was eating, I felt like a cow.
The advertising is a little crazy, but I do not find a second bottom in it.
It’s a brilliant invention,” someone wrote.
Someone else commented, “It’s a funny ad aimed at mothers who pull food away (often at work or the toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.
It is not intended to praise or criticize the dairy industry.”
At the end of the film, it turns out that the women danced with the lactators attached discreetly to the chest.
The campaign was inspired by the idea that many nursing women feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s lactator is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and can be worn unnoticed under a feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, hold children in their arms, and even leave the house while pulling food.
Ana Balarin, Partner and Creative Director at Mother, said: “The Elvie Lactator is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative premiere.
By combining nursing women and dairy cows, we wanted to show all the challenges that are associated with food withdrawal, while presenting in a fun and consistent way the amazing sense of freedom that it provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's lactator has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, during the show of Marta Jakubowski, the mother of two children with this product just attached appeared on the catwalk.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Secretly Transferred to Camp on Texas Border
The number of migrant children detained is growing rapidly, although the number of people crossing the border each month does not actually change. This is due in part to the harsh rhetoric and rules introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Most sponsors are usually undocumented immigrants who are afraid of being deported if they come for a child.
That risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that fingerprints would be taken from potential sponsors and other adults living on the joint farm, which would then be handed over to immigration authorities.
Last week, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Matthew Albence, testified before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who volunteered as sponsors for children left unattended.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not previously been listed.
“Nearly 80 percent of people who sponsor or live with them in the same household are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That’s why we are constantly chasing them,” Albence said.
Shelter workers say that as part of efforts to speed up child regulation, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained — not after 60 days, as was the case under previous standards.
Many will be betting via videoconferencing, rather than in person, to ask an immigration judge to legalize their status.
Those who do not qualify for release will be deported immediately.
According to the shelter staff and reports that have been published in recent months, the longer the children are in custody, the easier they can become restless or depressed, which in turn can lead to outbreaks of aggression or attempts to escape.
Defenders have found that these problems are even more serious in larger centers, such as Tornillo, where because of its size, it is easier to overlook the signals that something is wrong with the child.
They also added that moving children to a camp without providing them with adequate time for emotional preparation or saying goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many of them are already dealing with.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish ‘occupying forces’ to withdraw immediately
During a speech before the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "we will deal with them accordingly."
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem says the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions forced to flee their homes since 2011.
He says Damascus will continue to “conduct its holy battle until the territory of Syria is cleared” of both terrorist groups and “all foreigners staying there illegally.”
There are currently about 2,000 U.S. troops stationed in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish and Syrian forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
In addition, there are more than 1,000 French soldiers in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the conditions were good enough for them to return, and accused “some Western countries” of “raising irrational fear” that discourages them from returning.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help in these returns,” he said.
“They politicize matters that should have a purely human dimension.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad concludes a political agreement with the opposition to end the war, Syria will not receive any reconstruction aid.
UN diplomats say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel bastion in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey helped prevent a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement has a “clear timeframe” and expressed hope that the military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Popular Defense Front of the Levant, who would be “eliminated.”
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene the first meetings of the new commission, made up of members of the ruling party and the opposition, soon to draw up a draft of Syria’s post-war constitution and prepare for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the commission, saying the panel’s work should be limited to “verifying the provisions of the current constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win the election again
By this logic, President Trump would be elected for a second term in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers probably hope, his presidency ends early with his removal from office and a scandal.
It would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential final yet.”
So far, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN’s prime-time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million viewers, and MSNBC’s has nearly tripled to 1.6 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, Fox News attracted an average of 2.4 million viewers during peak viewing hours, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" reached the highest ratings on cable, attracting 3.5 million viewers of evening news programs.
“People are flying like moths to the fire — that’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Bear, the ABC’s executive producer of “Designated Survivor,” about the cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
Before the 2016 election, she was driving a taxi in Boston.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
“Because it makes me laugh,” he replied.
“Chaos has an entertainment value.”
Of course, reports from Washington could, like nothing else shown on television, determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the admissibility of uniting immigrant families, or the state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Besides, it’s not just about being a well-informed citizen when you watch a panel of experts debating Bob Woodward’s use of secret informants while writing the book “Fear,” about Paul Manafort’s 15,000 dollar ostrich-skinned jacket (“the president’s clothes overloaded with pride,” as the Washington Post put it) for six hours.
I’ll never look at Super Mario like I did before.
“What he does is kind of like a reality show in that he delivers new content every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about Trump’s changing cast and the day-to-day twists of the show (like attacking NFL players or praising Kim Jong Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna be in arrears.
When I met Mike Fleiss this week, the weather on the north coast of Kauai, where he has his home, was beautiful, but he was sitting inside, watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn’t get away from it, not when Brett Kavanaugh was standing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court weighed in.
“I remember we used to do all these crazy programs and people would say, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right.”

The inflow of money from the outside on the election campaign to Congress
Unsurprisingly, after the reorganization of the constituencies, which resulted in the race for one seat now two sitting congressmen, to the 17th constituency in Pennsylvania flows a river of cash.
This newly formed suburban district of Pittsburgh represents Democratic Representative Conor Lamb in Congress, who won his seat in another district during a special election last spring.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the former District 12 of Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new District 17.
The county maps were revised after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties had been demarcated unfairly, giving Republicans an advantage and unconstitutional.
The race in the new 17th district began with a fight to fund the campaign between the party’s main funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamba gained popularity in Pennsylvania after winning by a hair’s breadth in the widely commented elections to the 18th constituency held in March.
The Republican has been in office for more than a decade, with Donald Trump winning by 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States has considered punishing El Salvador for its support for China, but has withdrawn from the idea.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, despite slight opposition from Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a cordial meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela, and until the expulsion by the partners of the Trump Organization management team, he had a hotel in Panama.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions to cease recognizing Taiwan,” said Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert in a statement this month.
However, the sanctions under consideration were to be imposed only on El Salvador, which in 2017 was estimated to have received $140 million in aid from the United States, including for the fight against drugs and support for development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which were meant to include restrictions on financial aid and the granting of visas to certain individuals, would be very severe for this Central American country, which faces high unemployment and a high murder rate.
As international meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to address the findings of a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
In mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus eliminating any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Diplomats say Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference, which is currently scheduled for mid-October, signaling an invitation to a meeting of administration officials.
Three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, accompanied by no new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
White House spokesman John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was presented by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who, on condition of anonymity, agreed to discuss internal negotiations.
Their relations were confirmed by an external analyst from the administration’s environment, who also spoke anonymously.
Learn History
Another element could be a report by special counsel Robert Mueller on President Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, for which concrete evidence is now publicly available.
According to reports, Robert Mueller’s investigation is also investigating whether Donald Trump’s campaign had anything to do with Russia’s attack on the U.S. election.
If the composition of Congress changes, President Trump will be held accountable by him in preparation for his re-election speech, and may even be tried before a jury.
There are a lot of unknowns here, and I don’t want to suggest that the fall of Trump — or those in his equivalent positions in Europe — is inevitable.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make a choice that will decide how long it can take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, if only the West resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
This failed and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The tracks of history revolve around such turning points, speeding up or slowing down the inevitable march of democracy.
There are now several such turning points before the Americans.
What will we do if Donald Trump fires Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom the future of the Robert Mueller investigation depends?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since we revealed in our paper that he proposed a covert recording of the president last year and speculated that he was unfit for the job.
According to Rosenstein, the report presented by The Times is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s newly commissioned investigation into Brett Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or unfair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, in the middle of the presidential term, will we elect to Congress the people who will hold Donald Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, there will be difficult times for democracy.
However, I believe that we will succeed – because of the lesson I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that swastika-marked table.
With such a legacy, how could I not look to the future with optimism?”

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is looking forward to the match with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers take on Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that the victory against the Austrians, achieved after an impressive draw with Villareal achieved this month in Spain, will significantly increase their chances of qualifying from the Group G of the Europa League.
Up until the 2:2 draw with Villareal, a knee injury prevented assistant Graham Dorrans from playing this season, but he believes this result will work on the Rangers as a trampoline to greater success.
“It was good for us because Villarreal is in good shape,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went to this game with the belief that we would achieve something – and we won the point.
Maybe we could have pressed them in the end, but in general the draw is probably a fair result.
The Spaniards were probably better in the first half, but in the second half we were better.
As for Thursday, it is another important evening for Europe.
We hope that we will be able to get three points, but this match will be difficult, because our opponent got a good result in his last match. However, I am sure that thanks to the support of the fans we will pass and we will win a positive result.
The last year has been definitely tough due to everything related to my injury and the changes at the club itself, but now we all feel good in our seats.
The team is great, and the boys really like to play.
I hope we can move on, put the last season behind us and be successful.”
The fear of retirement savings spends women's sleep from the eyelids
Although the survey participants knew exactly how they wanted to be taken care of, few talked about it with their families.
In a study conducted by Nationwide, about half of the participants said they had talked to their spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their kids.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not talking about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide, which sells life insurance.
Where to start?
Talk to your spouse and children: You won’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t express your will beforehand.
Discuss with your advisor and family where and how you want to be looked after, as this choice will be an important factor in determining costs.
Ask for help from a financial advisor: They can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care funds can come from a traditional care policy, a hybrid policy that allows you to withdraw cash to cover such expenses, or from your own assets — if you have one.
Prepare legal documents: This will prevent legal battles.
Designate a trusted health care representative who will supervise and ensure that appropriate individuals act in accordance with your will if communication becomes impossible.
Also consider hiring an attorney to handle your finances.
Choose a trusted person, because they will make financial decisions for you and make sure that all bills are paid if you are not able to do it yourself.
Do not forget about the details: Imagine that your elderly parent suddenly needs medical help and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down all the information to have it ready.
“It’s not just about finances, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin asks.
“What medications do you take?
Who will take care of the dog?
It’s worth having a plan on hand.”
Man shot multiple times in Ilfracombe
The man was repeatedly shot by a windbreaker as he was returning home from an evening party.
The 40-year-old was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m. BST time, as an “accidental act.”
The victim didn't see the assailant.
The injuries suffered do not endanger the life of the man. The police ask to report witnesses to the incident.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people have died as a result of the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Because of broken communications, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala cabupate, which is located north of Palu, closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some important information about the city of Palu and the Donggala Cabubate on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Central Celebes, a province located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island. According to estimates in 2017, they were inhabited by 379,800 people.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city was celebrating the 40th anniversary of its foundation.
Donggala is a kabupaten (administrative unit lower than the province) extending along the northwest coast of the island for more than 300 km.
It is estimated that in 2017 it was inhabited by 299,200 people.
The main branches of the economy of Central Celebes are fishing and agriculture, which developed especially in the coastal cabupaten of Donggala.
Another source of income for the province are nickel mines, but they are mainly located in Morawali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, earthquakes and tsunamis have struck Palu and Donggala several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami that hit Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami killed nine people in western Donggali.
Indonesia is on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, which is why earthquakes occur there quite regularly.
The biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake that struck the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, the west coast of Sumatra was hit by a series of powerful earthquakes.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: In southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, there was a 6.8-magnitude earthquake, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
As a result, more than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai off the coast of Sumatra. It triggered a tsunami wave as high as 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya kabupaten in Aceh province, causing devastation and panic among people who still remembered the devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but the collapsed buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Indonesia, Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on its northern side.
They caused the destruction of thousands of homes and brought temporary trouble to thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
According to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, a 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on charges of domestic violence, obstructing the filing of a report and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when a friend of the suspect tried to call the police to report the crime, he took her phone.
KTUU reports that Palin is in Mat-Su's custody and has a $500 bail.
According to her information, last Saturday he stood before the court, where in his defense speech he said that he was “certainly innocent”.
Palin has three Class A offenses, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, for which he faces a prison day sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has faced criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Claims Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, making it difficult to file a report, and possession of a weapon in an intoxicated state in connection with the incident.
His partner says he punched her in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin, who linked her son’s aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder he developed while serving in Iraq.
Hundreds of people died in the tsunami after the earthquake in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in Friday’s earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Celebes.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central part of the island of Celebes, which is located northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of disaster.
When the tsunami hit the coast, there were hundreds of people on the beach in Palu, where the festival was held.
Federal prosecutors demand death penalty for suspect in New York terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. This is a rare punishment — it has not been carried out in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
To carry out the attack, which took place in October on a bicycle path running along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck, which he ran pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
According to a notice filed in New York’s Southern District, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious injuries.
According to the court document, both of these charges are punishable by death.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal jury presented Saipov with a 22-count indictment, including eight counts of murder for illegal activity — a procedure typically followed by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases — and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack required "solid planning and deliberation" and described the way Saipov carried it out as "monstrous, cruel and immoral".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov brought harm, harm and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hern Ferruchi, Hern Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagn<0xC3><0xA3>o.
Five of the victims were Argentine nationals who had been in New York on tourism.
The last time the death penalty was applied in the Southern District of New York was ten years ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but ultimately received a life sentence in September 2009.
The death penalty as a result of a federal case was last carried out in New York in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The marriage was executed after two years earlier they were found guilty of conspiracy and espionage in favor of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who comes from Uzbekistan, did not show remorse in the months after the attack.
Police say he told investigators he was fine with what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov confessed to the authorities that he was inspired by the ISIS videos he watched on his phone.
According to police, he also demanded the hanging of the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
On the indictment, which includes 22 charges, he replies that he is innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defense attorneys who represent Saipov, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and to refuse life without parole after pleading guilty will only prolong the suffering that these events have brought on all concerned,” he said.
Saipov’s defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should take responsibility for Brexit negotiations
During today's protest, which took place during the Tory conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the army of the people."
The former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians must “feel hot” from Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested he should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that if Farage was Brexit secretary, “the UK would be out of the EU by now.”
However, the inclusion of Tories who wanted to remain in the community in a separate protest against Brexit, which took place in the city, further highlighted the burden of reconciling their deeply divided ranks facing Theresa May.
The Prime Minister is struggling to implement her compromise plan with Chequers amid attacks from Brexit supporters, opponents and the European Union itself.
Its allies say that despite the opposition, it will seek to conclude a deal with Brussels and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its proposal and “chaos”.
Peter Bone told the Leave Means Leave assembly in Solihull that he wanted to “throw the plan out of Chequers.”
He suggested that Nigel Farage should be the plenipotentiary, who should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we would be out of the EU by now,” he said.
A Wellingborough MP added: “I support Brexit, but we have to throw out the Chequers plan.”
Presenting his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be subject to anyone now.
We want to have our rights in our own country.”
Peter Bone rejected suggestions that citizens had changed their minds since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the Union is completely untrue.”
Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns, from the Tory party, told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan does not have the support of the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, our party and our activists who populate the streets and who elected us do not support it either.
Drop the Chequers plan and start listening.”
In a statement to Prime Minister Theresa May, she added: “Prime Ministers maintain their positions when they keep their promises.”
Nigel Farage said politicians taking part in the demonstration must “feel hot” if they are to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it is a question of trust between us – the people – and the political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them we will not let you do that.”
Addressing the cheering crowd, he added: “I want you to make the politicians who are on the verge of betraying Brexit feel hot.
“We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country who gave us the victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom.”
Opponents of Brexit marched through the city to the centre, where a two-hour demonstration took place.
A handful of activists waved “Torys against Brexit” banners after forming the group this weekend.
Labour activist, Baron Andrew Adonis, laughed at the Conservatives for the security issues of the party app at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who say they can organize the IT systems and all the technology to support a Canada-plus plan, a smooth border, free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
"It's a complete farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he said.
Elizabeth Warren plans to ‘seriously consider’ running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “seriously consider running for president” after the November election.
As reported by The Boston Globe, the representative of the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a meeting with voters, which took place on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November. Her opponent will be the Republican representative, Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 election.
It is now said that Warren can defeat Trump in the 2020 election.
Saturday’s event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall since Donald Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he planned to run for president.
Elizabeth Warren responded that “the time has come for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government — and she means the woman at the top.”
Arrest of LSU team player Wayde Sims, the perpetrator of the fatal shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in the Friday shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge police department reported the arrest of 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson during a conference held at 11 a.m.
On Friday, a video of the shooting was released asking for help in identifying the man seen on it.
Wayde Sims, 20, was killed in a shooting near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head with a gun and died,” police chief Murphy J. Paul said in a statement.
Wayde defended a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being at the crime scene, carrying a gun and shooting Wayde.
After his arrest, during which he did not resist, he was taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
Wayde Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games, starting 10 times last season, spending an average of 17.4 minutes on the floor, scoring 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is coming to the world title after the team’s command allowed him to win against Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team’s command would have a big impact on the race result.
Bottas, who started from the first field, started very well and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove to the service point first and allowed Hamilton to ride in the tail of the peloton, which should decide the fate of the race.
The Mercedes rider came down to the pits in the next lap and appeared behind Vettel, but after a round-to-round action, as a result of which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside of the track, risking to be pushed into the defensive line after a double move by his rival to defend his position on the third corner, Hamilton took a turn.
Max Verstappen started from the end of the bet and in his 21st birthday at the end of the first lap he was in seventh place.
He then drove for a large part of the race because he did not change the tyres to make a quick finish and take away Kimi Raikkonen’s fourth position.
In the end, he drove to the service point on lap 44, but in the remaining eight laps he was no longer able to accelerate.
“It was a tough day because Valtteri was doing a great job all weekend and he turned out to be a real gentleman when he was told to let me go.
The whole team did their best to take the first two places,” said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
During a meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianna Feinstein, who claimed she did not disclose the contents of a letter from Christina Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony made by Christina Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead, he stated that what happened in the Senate showed that people are “wicked, malicious and lying.”
“What could have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate that we have been witnessing for several days, when we see anger, when we see people who are angry, mean, mean and lying,” he said.
“We see what’s been published and revealed, and then they tell us, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.’
I didn't do it.
You remember?
Dianna Feinstein, did you reveal that?
Remember her answer... did you reveal the contents of that document?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't reveal it."
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did we disclose... No, we didn’t disclose,” he added, mutilating the senator.
Dianna Feinstein received a letter from Christina Ford describing the allegations against Kavanaugh in July, and its content leaked in early September. The senator denies that her office was the source of the leak.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s insinuation, I didn’t reveal her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill newspaper.
“She asked me for discretion and I did not disclose the content as requested.”
However, her statement did not convince the president, who commented on it during Saturday’s meeting: “I’m telling you, it was really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, whom three women have accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that Democrats are using insinuations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to seize power by any means necessary.
You can see meanness, malice, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to destroy in order to take power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars — Belfast Giants 5:3
In a match against Dundee, Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants.
Dundee Stars have made amends for Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants, winning a 5-3 rematch at home on Saturday.
The giants quickly gained a two-point lead after shooting Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie evened the score, after which Dwyer again led the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard equalized again, scoring for Dundee, after which two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen sealed her victory.
It was the third loss of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's charges, who despite an initial loss on Friday night won 2-1 against Dundee in Belfast.
Both teams met for the fourth time this season – the first three matches were won by the Giants.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall McFaull's assist. Four minutes later Beauvillier doubled the score thanks to David Rutherford's assist.
After an intense opening at 13:10, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game, and then Matt Marquardt equalized the score at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' advantage before the first break, when he scored his second goal that evening at the end of the first third.
The host team was regrouped and Bouchard again equalized the score with the goal scored during the game in the lead at 27:37 minutes.
At the end of the second period, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen to secure the first advantage in the match. Dundee's final victory was sealed in the middle of the last period by the same player who scored the fifth goal for his team.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their next game at home in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies Helping Hundreds of People on Plane Escape Earthquake
An air traffic controller from Indonesia has been hailed as a hero after he died, helping to safely take off a plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people were killed and many were reported missing after a major earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area, and in the city of Palu, many people have been trapped in the rubble.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the swaying air traffic control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed there to make sure that the Batik Air plane (flight number 6321), which was just on the runway, took off safely.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he thought it was about to collapse.
He died in the hospital.
According to Australian ABC News, Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the controller’s decision likely saved the lives of hundreds of people.
We organized a helicopter from Balikpapan to Borneo to move it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, Anthony passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“This news has broken our hearts,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands. The National Disaster Management Agency reports that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“We believe the death toll is still increasing as many bodies are still under rubble and cannot be reached,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said in a statement.
A six-meter-long tsunami destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral of the victims will be held on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Ambulances are constantly bringing in bodies.
The drinking water is beginning to run out.
Small shops are being looted.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we will find there.
It’s a tragedy, and it could be worse.”
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo said, “I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all evacuation tasks.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
This year, Indonesia has been hit by an earthquake that has killed more than 550 people on the island of Lombok.
Air Niugini plane crash in Micronesia: One person reported missing after plane crashes in lagoon
Airlines operating the flight, which crashed at the lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific, reported that one person is missing. Earlier, they claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini reported that according to data on Saturday afternoon, they could not count one man who was traveling on a feral plane.
They assured that together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators are trying to find him.
However, they did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane hit the water during an attempt to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk, the rescue of the remaining passengers and crew members was assisted by local boats.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six other passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
It is not clear what caused the crash, and its exact course is unknown.
Airlines and the U.S. Navy say the plane landed on a lagoon not far from the runway.
According to some witnesses, he fell off the belt.
The American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was coming very low.
“It helped us a lot,” he said.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to get through the water reaching up to the belt to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
According to him, members of the cabin crew panicked and screamed, and he himself suffered a harmless head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the rescue effort was also assisted by sailors who were working nearby to modernize the waterfront. They were able to use the inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to the Aviation Safety Network database, 111 people have died in airline crashes in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but Air Niugini is not among them.
The analyst reconstructed the events of the night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, prosecutors finished presenting evidence in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as a forensic expert in information analysis.
He described to the judges how, using cell phone records, he recreated the route of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
According to the newspaper Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he obtained location data from various mobile phones, which showed that Tellis was from Chambers on the feral evening, thereby overturning his earlier claims.
When the records confirmed that while Quinton was supposed to be with his friend, Michael Sanford, his cell phone was at Jessica Chambers, the police decided to interrogate Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he was not in town that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford’s truck that night, he replied that he was “lying because my truck was in Nashville at the time.”
Another inaccuracy is Tellis's claim that he had known Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her contact details, as well as text messages and calls from her phone.
“He erased her from his life,” Hale said.
The final defence speech is scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that probably the same day the case will be referred to the jury.
The High Breed – what is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to change the negative image of the genre, filling their music with a positive message.
According to The High Breed of Bristol, today’s hip-hop has moved away from the original political content and social issues.
The band members want to return to its roots and restore the popularity of conscious hip-hop.
Thanks to the work of artists such as Akala and Lowkey, the revival of artists such as The Fugees and Common has recently been observed in the UK.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues couple for dismissal after 'racist' text message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for firing her from a racist job after receiving a misspelled text message in which the child’s mother complains that she is “another black person.”
The couple denies being racist, comparing the lawsuit to “blackmail.”
The mother of two, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was visibly dismayed when it was revealed that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, who famously appeared on her first day at work in 2016, was black.
“NIEEE, ANOTHER BLACK PERSON,” she wrote in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to him, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice by mistake.
According to the New York Post, when Plasco-Flaxman became aware of the blunder, she fired Gisella Maurice, claiming that the affectionate nanny, who is an African-American woman, was performing her duties poorly, and also expected a nanny from the Philippines.
Ms. Maurice was paid for the day’s work and then sent home by Uber.
She is now seeking compensation from the couple for the $350-a-day exemption multiplied by the six months she was originally employed with residency, even though she did not sign a contract.
“I want to show them that you don’t do that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have denied allegations of racism, saying that ending their relationship with Ms. Maurice was justified because, after they insulted her, they feared they would not be able to trust her.
“My wife sent something to her that she wasn’t going to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told The Post.
“Would you entrust your children to someone you hurt, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Comparing the lawsuit to “blackmail,” Plasco said his wife had given birth just two months earlier and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to blow something like this?
That’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
Although the case in court is not over yet, the public quickly issued a couple of sentences on social media, criticizing her for her behavior and way of thinking.
New letter reveals Paddington book publishers feared readers wouldn’t feel connected to the talking bear
The author’s daughter, Michael Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born soon after the book’s warm reception, says of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of the person who read it for the first time, even before the book was published.
It’s very funny now that we know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
She claims that her father, who before the little teddy bear inspired him to write a children's book, worked as a cameraman for the BBC, was sure that his work would be rejected. She also adds that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book seems "sweet and bitter".
About Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she says her father was secretly proud of his success.
“He was a quiet man, he didn’t brag,” he adds.
However, because Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who achieved something — you feel proud of him, even though it’s not your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although he himself invented and created it, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly and said it was really bad, he probably wouldn’t come out of it,” says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
Then he called to say that Natasha was going to die in two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be at your place.
The drugs that her doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly stopped working and were excreted from her body.
She died a while ago, and that was the end of it.
All I could do was sit back and wait with the knowledge that this was all developing.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was with other people.
I really had to hold on.”
Eventually Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who was already mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the ship with the other passengers, unaware of the anguish she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
I had my head down and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt all-encompassing compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcards from women in mourning to help prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide try to dissuade others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put postcards on the Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where people can get help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he became depressed, and he took his own life when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” he says.
Sharon Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew his smile.
They always said he could brighten any room with it.”
Before his death, however, he quit his job because he was “in a really black place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother was 11 years old and he was the one who found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm still afraid of the domino effect."
Sharon Davis created the cards “to tell people that there are people to turn to and talk to, even if they’re just a friend.
Don’t sit in silence, talk to someone.”
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother’s death.
“He didn’t say anything about feeling down or sad or anything,” he says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
When the kids opened the presents, he didn't even look at them."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: “This is tearing a hole in the family.
He's tearing us apart.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI investigates
“I thought if we could actually get what he asked for — a time-limited investigation and a limited scope — maybe we could achieve some kind of unanimity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was “falling apart” into opposing camps, leading to a deadlock.
Why did Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
All their resentment stems from the moment.
The congressional elections are just a few weeks away — November 6th. If, as predicted, the Republicans lose them, the chances of electing a particular person to the highest court in the country will significantly decrease.
George W. Bush was already picking up the phone to call the senators and get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the president’s personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI makes a report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will vote.
It’s unclear whether Brett Kavanaugh will get at least 50 senators’ votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim's rule, the number of North Korean refugees is declining.
According to the South Korean lawmaker, since Kim Jong Un took power seven years ago, the number of people fleeing North Korea to South Korea has fallen.
Citing data from South Korea’s Unification Ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 escapes last year and 2,706 in 2011.
According to him, the key factors that have influenced this situation are closer controls at the border between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not issued a public statement on the matter.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are ultimately offered South Korean citizenship.
According to authorities in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forcibly sends them back to the country.
Relations between the North and the South, which in theory are still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, where they held talks on denuclearization negotiations, which had previously stalled.
This happened after the historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, with Kim Jong-un, which took place in June in Singapore. The fruit of this meeting is a general agreement on the pursuit of the purification of the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of failing to make progress on the issue.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no certainty about our national security, and in these circumstances, there is no way that we can unilaterally disarm ourselves first,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he’s unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was inherently unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks during an interview she gave Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
“I think if a woman behaved in this way, she would be considered ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual harassment by Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At times, during his opening speech, Kavanaugh displayed strong emotions —almost screaming and losing his speech as he discussed family issues and his high school years.
He also explicitly rebuked Democrats on the committee, describing the charges against him as a “grotesque and coordinated assault on reputation” orchestrated by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony showed he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because it exposed his bias against Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself by making these statements, as well as by the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Asked if she would seek to remove Kavanaugh from office if he was nominated and if Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
“I’ll say this: If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he shouldn’t just sit on the Supreme Court, he should be in the court where he’s currently working,” she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she fears Kavanaugh’s possible rulings on the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade trial because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh sided with questions about whether he would overrule some Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time to bring to justice a hysterical, prejudiced person who expects us to say ‘but it’s wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
And women have to control it.
It's a proper diatribe, months and years of raging fury, and she can't get it out of her system without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
“That’s pretty common, isn’t it?”
She added: “I was helped tremendously by a woman who was a manager at a company. She said that she also cries when she’s angry, but she made up a way that when she gets angry and starts crying, she says to the person she’s talking to, ‘You probably think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry.
And he's still doing his thing.
I thought it was genius.”
Tears are acceptable as a vent of anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories from one of the first jobs in a male-dominated office was when I began to cry one day out of inexpressible rage. An older woman —a cool manager I had always been a little afraid of— grabbed me by the neck and led me up the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, and they're glad you're done."
Patricia Schroeder of the Democratic Party, then a member of Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with his mistress on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, frustrated to the limit, Patricia realized that she could actually consider running for president on her own.
“It wasn’t a deliberate decision,” she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates running and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone described the situation as “The Snow Queen and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign had been going on for a long time, Schroeder was behind in raising funds and promised herself that she would not enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a battle doomed to lose.
She discovered that some of her followers, who gave the men $1,000, only had $250 for her.
“Do they think I have any discounts?” she wondered.
During her speech, in which she announced that she would not be running a formal campaign, she was so filled with emotion—gratitude to those who supported her, frustration at a system that made it so difficult to raise money and appeal to voters, not delegates, and anger at sexism—that her voice stuck in her throat.
“You’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” recalls the reaction of the press.
“You’d think I’d be sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my gravestone.

What are the benefits of Beijing's economic war between the United States and China?
The salvos that started the economic war between the US and China were deafening, and while the battle is still ongoing, in the long run the conflict between these countries could be beneficial to Beijing, experts say.
The first warning was issued this year by U.S. President Donald Trump, who imposed tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week after the introduction of new tariffs on $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods, resulting in the taxation of half of all goods entering the US from China.
Each time, Beijing reciprocated in nature, recently raising tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods from five to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to every U.S. strike, and it doesn’t look like the world’s second-largest economy is about to give up.
Forcing Washington to back down means accepting the demands, but publicly bowing its head to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
But experts say if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure from the U.S. trade war could strengthen China in the long run, reducing the interdependencies between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision made in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions to unleash economic chaos in one of the countries is in fact much more dangerous than previously admitted by observers,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia researcher at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria's foreign minister says it is 'ready' for refugees to return
The government says Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“The situation on our soil is now more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
In an effort to restore normalcy, the government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions have already been met for refugees who have had to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods to return to it voluntarily.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million people have left Syria since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living there are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to accept help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid offered by the countries that sponsored the insurgency.
Europe seals victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the US team 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris.
On European soil, the United States has lost for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when, under the leadership of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, it received 14.5 points, which were needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was not doing well for most of the tournament, hit the ball from the stand straight into the water at the 16th hole of PAR3, thus giving the match to Francesc Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined through all the rounds and became one of the four players who, since 1979, when this tournament was held for the first time in its current format, managed to get a 5-0-0 result.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated 5&4 by the lowest ranked player from Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who occupies the highest position in the world ranking, lost two holes before the last hole with the Englishman Ian Poulter, for whom this may have been the last tournament of the Ryder Cup.
The European with the most wins in the Ryder Cup was Spanish Sergio Garcia, who has already taken part in eight such tournaments and scored 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for believing in me and choosing me.
I am so happy to get the cup back.
It’s a success for the whole team and I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said after the team’s European victory.
He passes the baton to his compatriot, John Rahm, who on Sunday defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in a 2&1 singles game.
“I feel incredibly proud of winning against Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him play,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods has lost all matches in France and now has 13-21-3 results in the Ryder Cup.
This is an unprecedented statistic, as one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 of the most important titles and was second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team had trouble finding a track all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of the American squad, his captain, Jim Furyk, said: “I’m proud of the guys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we pressed some Europeans.
We pulled out.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
Together with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission, we will find a way to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
I am full of admiration for my opponents.
They played much better than us.”
