What do you want?
What does TATOEBA mean?
Where have you been all afternoon?
You found a nice guy.
He did it out of jealousy.
She washed her dirty hands before eating.
I haven't talked to anyone about it.
Don't get too used to it.
I'm thinking about taking a few days off.
Tom never speaks French to me.
Tom left a high tip on the table.
There's nothing like a glass of beer after a day's work.
She doesn't know any of us.
I am still satisfied with my work.
Do you really need help?
If I were you, I'd ask him.
Leave them for us.
Here's the map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to that meeting, even though I was invited.
Are you still here?
I thought you were probably dating Tom.
I have to get off at the next station.
The dream was a mystery to me.
I'm sure you paid a lot for it.
Tom's obviously lying.
Straight and then right and then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why don't I have any food in the fridge?
It was just an accident.
I'll have to get back to you.
Tom says he'd like to win.
Tom will be 13 the day after tomorrow.
Cut the meat into thin slices.
I can't watch him ruin his life.
Do everything with prudence.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
Yes, you do.
We climbed to the top of Mount Fuji.
My wife and I want to go to Boston with you.
Do you remember what she was like?

Playing bassoon is not easy.
She took the job just to please her husband.
Moscow is the capital of Russia.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom hesitated to mention the subject.
We drink a lot of beer here.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it for Tom.
You shouldn't be selfish.
Ancient customs are rapidly dying out today.
Tom's still busy.
You'd better get going now.
Tom is childless.
I like to read.
We cut the rope.
I'm sorry to bother you, I just came by to apologize.
Tom's not gonna help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The train had to stop because there was a fallen tree on the tracks.
What was Tom yelling at the crowd?
He is the ideal husband for me.
She's not as beautiful as her older sister.
I brought you lunch today.
We're going to a costume party in the 17th century.
Are you happy with your body?

He climbed the tree with great effort.
The translation of the Czech text is very difficult.
Tom's probably the only one who knows the truth.
Tom was standing too.
We already know all that, Tom.
I'm glad you brought this to my attention.

It's a beautiful language.
I won't be home for a week.
Who sent you there?
We complained to the manager about the noise in the next room.
You're a kind person.
Can you ask Mary to ask Alice?
His skill qualifies him for the job.
The hail's coming down.
She was alone in the dark.
Tom didn't hesitate to tell Mary the truth.
Open your eyes.
I know Tom's wife.
Do you have a pen?
They're not helping.
I like that tie.
We didn't do as well as we would have liked.
Please close the door when you leave.
I'll be back tonight.
Did you and Joana have a fight?
You don't owe me anything.
You scared me.
The girls I met today were students.
The sky is covered with black clouds.
I need it more than you do.
You bought a car.
I'm afraid I'll be stuck here forever.
Tom had an enema.
What should I do in this situation?
Do you go to school by train?
Tom won't be in school today.
I'm mad at Tom.
Who is Tom visiting?
It's Tom, not Mary.
Why don't you ask me out for a drink?
Why doesn't Tom answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I cannot answer that question.
I'm not sure what Tom bought.
There's another question.
I won't be surprised when that happens.
He's single.
People don't normally say that.
Ask your mother.
Tom carefully washed his feet.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
Jana was as happy as a flea when she got her recording contract.
I wish you'd come with us.
He spends a lot of time at his computer.
We wouldn't be in this mess if you helped us.
I don't know what to do anymore.
He visits his uncle.
They're all out.
Tom couldn't hear it, but Mary could.
I can give you an autograph if you want.
I saw him three years ago.
How could anyone live in a place like this?
It's been raining for two days.
I know exactly what's going on.
Have you ever sung in French?
I'm used to this cold weather.
The Americans surprised the Germans.
There are not enough chairs in the conference room.

I took part in the search.
Sam went straight to bed.
We shot through a lawn by the river.

Tom doesn't like to work.
My heart is French, but my ass is international.
If you have a problem, I want to know what it is.
Tom grabbed Mary's hand.
I'm perfectly happy myself.
You did what you had to do.
We have to understand that we are still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tom played tennis with Mary yesterday.
What's your dad's name?
There were half-broken walls.
I spoke to him in English and found that I could communicate.
Tom had to run.
I see a book.
Did any of you ever talk to Tom?
You should apologize.
The fence is freshly painted.
She knows who you are.
I want you to see her.
Well, you're gonna regret this.
You're fat.
We should win.
All answers must be written according to the instructions.
Answer my questions.
Everyone would be happy if Tom left and never came back.
Did you bring the book?
I don't dare open my mouth.
Their father is Czech and their mother is from Hungary.
I'm thinking of divorcing her.
I bought a bag.
Do you know where your father comes from?
What are you?
Did you do it on purpose?
There was absolutely no doubt.
This letter is personal, and I don't want anyone else to read it.
As far as I know, he's not married.
I can't say anything bad about Tom.
Stand over there and you'll see better.
He's old enough to stand on his own two feet.
As soon as we saw what Tom was wearing, we got a fit of laughter.
Tom's wrong, isn't he?
Better to be dead than to be red.
They agreed to postpone the wedding.
If I were you, I'd go home.
It would be great if you would do that for me.
Tom knows what he wants to say.
The wedding took place last week.
I'm still eating.
The horse roars.
I lent Tom a comb.
I'm boring.
I'm writing my will.
I'm not such a wuss anymore.

I don't want to change anything.
Bartender, I'll have a drink.
Do you like strawberries?
It used to be bigger.
I assume he's gone home.

I'd better get back inside.
She doesn't have to.
I know she's pretty.
I don't go to school on Sundays.
He has his own house.

Stealing, huh?
Tom's got to get his hair done.
You should consult a lawyer in advance.
You're a good journalist.
That's what Tom's used to.
I love this book.
The waste is clogged again.
When I got home from work, I found out that someone had stolen our apartment.
Read the book.
This used to be a bakery.
My father runs a restaurant.
You're really boring.
I like silent films.
This is working.
Don't make a sound.
I'd like to make more money.
I know you're still not satisfied.
Can this report be true?
He got it, he got rid of it.
