Members of the Wales Assembly worry they ‘look like muppets’
Some members of the Assembly are astounded by the proposal to change their title to "CHUP" (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal was provoked by plans to change the name of the Assembly of the "Parliament of Wales".
Members from across the political spectrum worry that this could become a laughing matter.
One Labour member said his group was concerned that the new name "rhymes with Tup and Vdlob."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, this definitely has an offensive meaning.
According to one Plaid party member, the entire group was “not happy” and offered alternatives.
A spokesman for the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "not prejudiced" by the name change, but noted that the new name "MWP" bears a certain verbal resemblance to "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced similar to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter U.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drawing up a draft bill to change the name, made the following statement: “Of course, the final decision on all descriptive names by which the members of the Assembly are called will belong to the members themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which established broad support for the Assembly becoming known as the "Parliament of Wales".
As for the position of its members, the Commission prefers “members of the Welsh Parliament, abbreviated as ‘PMC’, but the ‘PMC’ option has received the most support after consulting the public.
Members of the Assembly offer alternatives, but reaching a consensus would clearly be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the draft of the amendment bill within a few weeks.
The reform bill will also include other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules for disqualification of its members, as well as the design of the commission system itself.
The members of the Assembly will have the final vote on what they will be called when they come to the discussion of the bill.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is planned to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has an administrative region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to Greek state territory, and has repeatedly objected to its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on changing the country's name, said he would not count the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the country's name is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are silent amid the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“Historically speaking, according to the old people I talked to, there was a bar and a church literally on every corner,” Adams said.
“They’re both gone today.”
Adams says the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People today socialize in different ways,” he adds.
“Bars are no longer the neighborhood’s everyday, where everyone gathers regularly.”
As for the churches, he expressed concern that the money from the sale of the assets would not last as long as the leaders expected, "and sooner or later they will be in the same position."
The man added that churches could be replaced by apartment blocks where people live who do not help the other sanctuaries of the neighborhood survive.
“The vast majority of people who buy homes in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing down these churches, as it is not particularly likely that most of the new settlers will visit them.”
Both churches were built of white pastures before Harlem became a black neighborhood—the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the years after 1930.
After that, the building became the property of the black residents of the neighborhood.
St. Martin was taken over by black Christians under the leadership of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott against retailers on 125th Street, which is Harlem’s main market street, because they did not want to hire black employees.
In 1939, the building suffered heavy damage in a fire, but Father Johnson's parishioners drew up a plan for its restoration, ordering the bells.
The Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor of St. Martin, proudly calls them “poor bells.”
The expert who used the bells in July has another description: “Cultural treasure” and “an indispensable historical instrument.”
The corresponding expert, Tiffany Nguy of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first bell system in the world that was used by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who switched to the larger system at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather mentions that St. Martin's never replaced him.
What happened at St. Martin’s in the last few weeks was a complex tale woven by architects and performers, some brought in by secular church leaders and others by an episcopal diocese.
From the vestiary – which is the governing body of the congregation, consisting of secular leaders – they wrote to the diocese in July, expressing their concerns that the diocese “would be willing to pass on the cost to the vestiary,” although he had no role in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
13-year-old boy injured by shark in California lobster hunt
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while he was diving for lobster in California on the first day of the hunting season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near the beach of Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends around half an hour on Saturday morning when he overheard the boy screaming for help and rushed along with a group to get him out of the water.
Hamel first thought that the child had caught a lobster and was excited, then realized how he was screaming “Bite me!
You bit me!"
Hamel says that when he reached the boy, he realized that the entire area of his clavicle had been torn.
“I told everyone to come out of the water because there is a shark!” he added.
The boy was flown by helicopter to San Diego's Rady Children's Hospital, where he was taken into critical condition.
It is not yet known what type of shark was responsible for the attack.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles told a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the water a few weeks earlier, but was judged not to be of a dangerous species.
Jills added that the victim had sustained traumatic injuries to her upper body.
Authorities have closed access to the coastline from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Suomi in Encitinas for 48 hours on safety grounds while the investigation is ongoing.
Jills notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which, however, do not pose a danger to humans.
Sainsbury’s planning a UK market offensive for beauty products
Sainsbury faces Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by opening beauty stalls at its facilities where customers will be served by dedicated assistants.
As part of a significant <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn offensive in the UK beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and home products decline, the biggest beauty stands to date will be located in 11 stores across the country, after which they will be opened in more locations if the initiative is successful.
The investment turn in the beauty industry comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the vacant space on the shelves, until recently occupied by TVs, microwaves and other household appliances.
Sainsbury said it would double the number of beauty products on offer to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current product ranges from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get more space, similar to the offers in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique range of make-up products so that most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly sought after by younger consumers.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will test discount programs at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, while the second will open in Selye Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the shifting focus on shopping for smaller amounts of food daily at convenient times leads to supermarkets having to put in more effort to attract shoppers.
Mike Cope, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the stores will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to crack down on discounters Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury has hundreds of Argos stores and has also opened Habitats since they bought both chains two years ago – which the company says has boosted grocery sales and made the gains even more profitable.
The supermarket chain’s previous attempt to redesign its beauty and pharmaceutical facilities was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury made a joint attempt with Boots at the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company's facilities in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 sites to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the plan by providing a wide range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty stands to enhance the overall experience of our customers.
We also invested in special training of our colleagues who will offer professional advice on the spot.
The range of brands we offer is designed to meet every taste and every need in a fascinating environment with a convenient location, and this combination makes us an attractive destination for beauty products that challenges the very concept of the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones ‘angry’ after Holly Willoughby’s rejection of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is “angry” after TV host Holly Willoughby reneged on an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time for the brand of household appliances and accessories Truly.
The couple’s business is compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old anchorwoman of “This Morning” announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones “buzzing” after pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “angry” when the TV’s “golden girl” admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at his business empire’s headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire that her new contracts – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – meant there would no longer be time for his brand of household products and accessories, Truly.
The business is similar to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand, with rumours that it has doubled Willoughby’s fortune, which is forecast to be worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK by plane to head to one of her holiday properties.
One source said: “Truly was definitely Holly’s top priority.
It was expected to be her long-term commitment to secure her future over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave boiled absolutely all completely unprepared.
No one believed it could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
There is a warehouse in Marlowe that is full of products waiting to be sold.”
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of “This morning”, which is one of the most successful stars of the UK, could cost the company millions due to the large investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, and may also lead to a delay in the launch of the brand on the market.
And last but not least, it can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three children, along with her husband Dan Baldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby herself co-founded Truly with Cap in 2016, with Jones, 52, joining as the company’s chairman in March.
The two families often go on vacations together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand’s “ambassador” for M&S and will also replace Anne MacParlin as host of I Am a Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones made the following statement last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
Tough negotiations leading to a “warming up of relations”
He joked about the criticism he would receive from news channels for making comments that some would consider “unsuitable for the president” and too positive for the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded in a humorous “journalistic” way.
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first one took place in Singapore in June and was declared by Trump a “major step towards the elimination of North Korea’s nuclear weapons.”
But negotiations to eliminate these weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, top North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea “does not see a reciprocal attitude” from the United States to his country’s first steps on the path to disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
In his speech, Trump presented a much more optimistic view of things.
“Our relationship with North Korea is great,” he said.
“We were going to war with this country.
Millions of people would have died.
Instead, we are now enjoying a wonderful relationship.”
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had led to positive results — ending missile tests, releasing hostages and returning the bodies of U.S. service members home.
He also defended his unorthodox approach to negotiations with Kim.
“It’s extremely easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded zone, we’d have about 200 people right there,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and led to the death of hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told there was no need for them.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok were forced to leave their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for the initiation of international assistance.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, there is an unequivocal view that international assistance is not wanted, which makes things slightly challenging,” Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to head to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate in the country.
National disaster agency spokesman Mr Sutopo said Indonesian authorities were currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to reconstruction efforts.
Taking into account the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains still unprepared for this kind of natural disasters.
Although shelters were built in Aceh in the event of a tsunami, they are not a common sight on the other coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu likely contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was issued.
Even under the best of conditions, transport between the many Indonesian islands presents a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate this logistics even more.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to service the victims of the earthquake has made its way to Palu, but it will be at least three days before it manages to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia’s backward infrastructure a focus of his election campaign by investing heavily in roads and railways.
But insufficient finances are constantly harassing his office, while Joko heads back to the urns the following year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands forced to flee their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other primeval weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge brought a late draw for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing in the Premier League against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute this Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pitch from Jerdan Shakiri about 27-28 meters from Chelsea's door, while his team was 1-0 behind.
He adjusted the ball to his left leg, then fired a precise shot to the far corner of the door.
The ball flew over the penalty area and headed to the upper right corner of the net.
She transferred the plagiarized Kepa Arisabalaga and tangled inextricably in the net.
“I tried to take a good position to master the ball because players like Shaq are always looking for passes in the front positions, so I just tried to get as much time as possible for a good shot to the goal,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming, I pushed my ball and I just shot without much thought.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the 25th minute after the goal of his Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The striker of the "blue" filed with a heel to Mateo Kovacic, then sprinted from the middle of the pitch to half of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> exchanged a quick double feed in the center.
Then he released a quick shot pass, with which he brought Hazard to a clean position in the penalty area.
Hazard overtook the defenders and scored with his left foot in the far corner past Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 this Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's next opponent will be Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency reported early Sunday.
Many people have been trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck the country on Friday and led to waves as high as 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, is littered with rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The remains of the 44-year-old woman were found at 7:55 a.m. with wounds from the stabbing of Grayson Meese on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking for assistance from anyone in the area who has seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan made the following statement: “The investigation is still at an early stage, but I implore anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers who may have caught something with their dashboard cameras, to contact us as they may have vital information for the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found on private property.
This afternoon, a group of friends, who consider the woman to be their friend, arrived at the place and asked where she was found in the morning.
The investigation continues, with police saying they are now informing the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Meese's apartment attempted to return to his apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
The man remained silent when he found out what had happened.
Residents were told it would be hours before they were allowed to return home.
One of the police officers told a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She kept saying, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans passed through the cordon while another van remained outside.
In the cordon are located police officers who monitor the housing block.
All those with information are asked to contact <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, code 247 on September 30.
Cromwell’s Parliamentary Statue Becomes Latest Memorial Hit by ‘Rewriting History’
Her ban would be poetic justice for his near-Taliban destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts, carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick’s proposal as “insane” and an “attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s next door to Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be victimized by the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
Cromwell's magnificent performance by Sir William Hamo Tornicroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of historiography of a figure that many still regard as worthy of respect.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps even more so in the 19th century than today, to be a defender of parliament against external pressure, and of course in his case it is the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate representation is the subject of continuous historical debate.
What is certain is the mid-17th-century conflict that shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly identifiable person who represents one side of the division that has occurred.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be commemorated and celebrated."
Killer Pig Injures Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his last name as Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a coke at Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig farmer was preparing to inject his pigs with vaccines on May 30, 2005, in Xinying, Qinghai Province, China.
He is believed to have arrived with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he also found the door to the next coop open.
He also reported that there was a large male pig with a blood-stained zurla in the cochlea.
Forensics have confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked the farmer fatally, the report said.
“My cousin’s legs were bleeding and disfigured,” Wu said, according to Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan going to the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The killer animal didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so it could not attack anyone else while police were gathering evidence from the crime scene.
Yuan’s family and market leaders are also reportedly negotiating compensation for the death.
Although they are rare, pigs that attack humans have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and after the attack, the man was critically injured.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor while his wife managed to chase him away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
“They’re just playing.
Pigs are like little children, extremely curious... not meant to hurt anyone.
But one must treat them with respect,” the man concludes.
The weakening Hurricane Rosa will lead to frequent and heavy rains in the southwestern United States
According to the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cool waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will lead to flooding rains in northern Mexico and southwestern parts of the United States.
Rose includes winds of 85 miles per hour, which is a Category 1 hurricane at about 5 a.m. on Sunday morning eastern time and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, she will begin to push tropical moisture deep north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to some areas of Mexico.
Over the next few days, tropical moisture along with the approaching syncline will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid flooding, debris streams and likely landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will cause rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain locations, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected, especially over most of Arizona.
There may be flash floods in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely imprudent to travel a handful in the desert when the threat of tropical rains is imminent.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to dust and gusty winds.
The approaching syncline will result in heavy rains in some parts along California’s southern coast.
It is possible to reach rainfall of more than half an inch, which will lead to carried small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainstorm of the rainy season.
In late Sunday and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona before the rain covers a larger area in late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
October can bring large temperature fluctuations to the U.S. as the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central United States.
There's about a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to rise and expand.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to have a warm start to October, with temperatures from the southern plains to parts of the northeast expected to predominate around 80 degrees.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the eye-catching spectacle of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political opposition continued, with networks interrupting their regular turnaround programs in the final minutes of Friday: an agreement that was settled by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, under which the FBI is to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent convinced that Kavanaugh was hitting on her drunk and trying to take her clothes off during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his emotionless testimony, is absolutely adamant that such a thing has never happened.
It is likely even more than Nielsen’s reported 20.4 million viewers watched the testimony on Friday.
The company counted the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no immediate data available on the other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen has also traditionally struggled to measure the number of people watching from their workplaces.
For comparison, we are talking about an audience similar in size to that of a championship football match or the Hollywood awards.
Fox News Channel, whose anchors strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the first of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught him booing protesters as he tried to grab an elevator for a meeting of the Judiciary Committee on Friday.
During the entire harassment for several minutes, he never lifted his eyes from the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here, standing in front of you," one woman said.
“Do you think he represents the truth to the state?
“You have power, while many women are completely helpless,” the attacks continued.
Flake responded that a statement had already been issued from his office and announced before the elevator doors closed that he would speak further during the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks provided tight live coverage a few hours later, when the Judicial Commission had to decide whether to pass Kavanaugh’s nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if he was sure the FBI would review the charges against the nominees next week, which Democrats in the opposition are pushing for.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After talking to Koons and several senators, Fleck made a decision.
His choice was definitely essential, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'political flirtations' with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political flirtations" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published earlier with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, stepped up his attack on her so-called “Lady’s Game Plan” on Brexit, suggesting that collecting UK customs duties on the EU and vice versa was “completely absurd”.
The shooting of Wade Simms: Police arrest suspect Dietian Simpson for the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dittian Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials presented a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, with police reporting that Simms had lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and also found Simpson’s DNA on them, according to a CBS WAFB affiliate.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police announced that he had confessed to the fatal shot at Wade.
His bail is set at $350,000, according to Advocate.
The Eastern Baton Rouge Office of Forensic Medicine released a preliminary report on Friday, citing a gunshot wound to the head and neck as the cause of death.
The department expressed its gratitude to the Louisiana State Police's fugitive search department, the police crime lab, Southern University police, and local residents for the assistance in the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Aleva thanked local law enforcement for “timely justice.”
Simms was 20 years old.
The six-foot-six-inch player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "crashed" and "in shock" after Wade's death.
Wade said, “It’s something that worries people all the time.”
Volcano scatters ash over Mexico City
Popocatepetl’s ash has reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash discharges were recorded in the past 24 hours.
The center has observed numerous tremors and tremors.
Images posted on social media showed a thin layer of dust covering the windshields of cars in some of Mexico City's neighborhoods, such as Hoquimilco.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with the gendarmerie as thousands joined opposing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing secession vote.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarmerie, began throwing eggs and powder paint at the peacekeepers, creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
Later in the day, other skirmishes with the police also occurred, with the police resorting to their sticks to control the situation.
For hours, pro-independence groups chanted “Don’t forget, don’t forgive,” while pro-independence groups responded with “Spain forever.”
Local press reported that as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical care for minor injuries.
Tensions remain high in the independence-seeking region even a year after an October 1 referendum was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist-minded Catalans.
The vast majority of voters cast their vote for independence, although activity was low as most opponents of secession boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations in the region with a series of violent clashes.
Independence-seeking groups spent Friday night in the street to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but she was forced to go on a different route.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who joined a separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer holds out hope for Catalonia's chances of independence.
“Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they could vote, but now we seem to be stagnant.”
Despite the important victory, be it by a small margin, in last December’s regional elections, Catalonia’s pro-independence political parties are having trouble this year as many of their most prominent leaders are either self-imposed exile or arrested pending trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Piug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest on his phone in support of police, said the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
His comment is that “it’s getting more and more tense.”
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders arrested pending a preliminary trial last year, announced he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
“My candidacy for the European elections is the best way to counter the regression of democratic values and the repression that we see on the part of the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car crashed into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car crashed into a house in Londonderry on several occasions.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent Thursday around 19:30 UK time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blumings said there was damage to both the gate and the building.
It is also possible that the car was shot with a crossbow.
Menga's goal brings Livingston's 1-0 victory over the Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga for Livingston secured the victory
The newcomer to the Premier League Livingston surprised the Rangers and caused only a second loss to Steven Gerrard in his first 18 games as manager of the club from Ibrox.
The goal of Dolly Menga proved decisive, and the team of Gary Holt equaled in points with the second in the ranking Hibernian.
Gerard's team remained without a victory on foreign soil in the Premier League this season, and next Sunday faced the driver Harts, from which he was behind by eight points in the standings.
But before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is already in a series of six matches without a loss in the championship, and manager Holt has not yet felt the taste of loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed good opportunities against thoughtless guests
Holt's team had to lead the score long before scoring a goal, and his direct style of play made the Rangers extremely difficult.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his blow went sideways, then Alan Lithgow fired along the beam after Craig Halkett returned the ball with his head towards him.
The hosts left the Rangers to play the ball, knowing that they could seriously hinder guests from static positions.
And this is how the winning goal came about.
The Rangers committed a foul, and Livingston played well, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson combining each other and taking out Menga, who led the ball and scored from the middle of the penalty area.
So far, the Rangers have mastered the ball more, but faced impenetrable defense of the hosts, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly rarely had to intervene.
This style of play continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a save.
The Rangers goalkeeper saved Scott Pitman's foot shot, and a blow to Little's head passed the door after another static for Livingston.
In the criminal field of Livingston fell centered, which, however, were easily cleaned, and the judge twice did not respect the claims of the guests for a penalty – first after a duel between Halket and the reserve Glen Middleton, and then in case of suspicion of playing with his hand.
"Fantastic" by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a great result for Livingston.
The team plays simply superbly, continuing to exceed expectations and improve its performance.
The style of play and line-up has hardly changed since the team's return to the Premier League, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for the way he transformed the team after his appointment.
He has real heroes on the field.
Captain Halket was amazing, organizing the defense in a superb way, while Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Warell under constant pressure.
At the same time, the Rangers did not show anything inspiring.
Under Gerard’s leadership, they demonstrated some great things, but in this case they were well below those standards.
They missed the last pass before the goal, having only once managed to split the defense of the hosts – this loss should wake up the Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the standings.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), we witnessed smiles and blue expanses when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
The friendship has cooled down due to problems affecting human rights, media freedom and Turkey's admission to the EU.
Then Erdogan headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside of Turkey.
For safety reasons, the police prevented a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but nevertheless there were many supporters who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to allow him into the country.
The various protests reflected the rift caused by one visitor, who was considered a hero by some German Turks and at the same time despised as a despot by others.
Deptford Road Crash: Biker Dies After Collision
A cyclist has died after a collision with a car in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and medical assistance arrived, but the cyclist died on the spot.
The crash comes a few months after another cyclist died after being hit by a runaway driver on Childers Street, located nearly a mile from the site of Saturday’s crash.
The Metropolitan Police announced that its employees are working to identify the man, after which they will notify his relatives.
The road is closed and bus lines are diverted, and motorcyclists are also advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Wardens Injured in Congestion
Six prison guards were injured in a riot in the high-security men's prison, according to the Prison Service.
The riot broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcester at around 09:30 UK time on Sunday and is still ongoing.
In order to control it, special officers from the Tordano squad were called up, who will have to deal with eight prisoners, with the riot itself confined to one wing of the prison.
The injured guards suffered minor injuries to their faces and received medical attention on the spot.
A spokesman for the Prison Service issued the following statement: “Specially trained officers have been called in to deal with the incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six guards received medical attention.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons and we are extremely clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and their sentences may be extended.”
Long Lartin Prison has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that after an attack on a prisoner, the director of the prison had to be treated in a hospital.
Also in October last year, riot police officers were called to a prison where they mastered a heavy riot in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flash flooding of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although arid areas may benefit)
It’s rare for Arizona to be hit by a tropical storm, but that’s likely to happen early next week as weakening Hurricane Rosa drifts through the desert in the southwest, bringing with it the risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already established flash flood control posts Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Finland on Tuesday, with late Mondays likely to bring rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have sustained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix!!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center envision 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches of rainfall possible in some places.
For those not at risk of flash floods, the Rose-induced rain may actually be a blessing, as the region is severely affected by drought.
Although floods are extremely serious concerns, part of the rain is likely to be beneficial, as the southwestern part is currently in drought.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring commission, just over 40% of Arizona suffers from at least excessive drought, which is the second most severe category.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to landfall on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rose, which on Sunday morning can still boast a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm meets cooler waters over the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
It is therefore expected to reach landfall in Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over part of Mexico can be heavy and lead to a significant risk of flooding.
"Summary rains are expected from up to 6 inches from Baja California to northwest Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches," weather.com said in a statement.
Rosa would then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which would then pass through Arizona in southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The main risk of Rosa or its consequences is extremely heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening flash floods and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old child was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in Midsomer Norton's Excelsior Terrace area around 4 a.m. British time on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where his condition remains “stable”.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police are asking anyone who may have filmed what happened to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered the ire and wrath' of Democratic Party
“Every vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the insidious and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered the ignominy and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, flatly dismissing Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation of sexual assault decades ago at a time when the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing of the indictment.
The president said in a statement on Saturday that “today the American people have witnessed the intelligence, courage and qualities” of Kavanaugh.
“Every vote in favor of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in support of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a wonderful reputation for public service,” the president told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president was indirectly referring to Kavanaugh’s nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican votes for the general election.
“There are five weeks left until one of the most important elections of our time.
Even though I’m not a candidate, in fact, I’m a candidate,” Trump continued.
“That’s why I go around and fight for good candidates.”
Trump said Democrats had set themselves a mission to “obstruct and obstruct.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican official told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, death toll rising
At least 384 people lost their lives as many were washed away by giant waves as a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when the coast was swept away by waves as high as six metres (18 feet) at dusk, leading many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami hit after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat went up yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn’t run away immediately, which is why many became victims of the disaster,” BNPB disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a briefing in Jakarta.
“The water had brought cars, trees, whole houses, hit everything in its path,” Nugroho continued, adding that the tsunami had crossed the high seas at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
“Some people climbed the trees and managed to escape from the water,” he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated at 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial images released by the disaster agency showed multiple destroyed buildings and shops, collapsed and twisted bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Secondary tremors continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) issued a statement saying that the energy released by Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographical location of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "huge" and specified that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of collapsed buildings, the spokesman added, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be higher along the coast 300km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the quake's epicenter.
He also added that “communications have been completely cut off and there is no information from Donggala.”
The Red Cross said more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its teams and volunteers had already headed to the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy, but it can get even worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was vehemently criticized for failing to report the Palu tsunami, although officials explained that the waves had arrived at the time of the announcement.
Amateur videos shared on social media showed a man on the top floor of a building shouting panic warnings to people on the street about the approaching tsunami.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall smashes into the shore and takes both cars and buildings.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the video in a timely manner.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a severe power outage that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees are still in desperate need of food and other necessities.
The city's airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Pali on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is now over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision employees from Donggala were able to get safely to Palu, where they found refuge in tarpaulin shelters spread out in the courtyard of their office, they passed by a number of scenes of devastation, Mr Doseba said.
“They told me they saw countless houses destroyed.”
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the start of work on rescue and rehabilitation operations of emergency groups, some complain that foreign rescuers with extensive experience in such situations are prevented from reaching Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, the financing, sending of personnel and supplies from abroad can only begin if the affected place is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“The disaster is still at a regional level,” said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government has announced that this is a national disaster, we can accept international assistance, but from there they have not yet declared such a status.”
As Palu falls on the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of those still missing continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones somehow survived the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days along with her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, has trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Championships, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped at the Roa-Roa hotel were his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
“As a senior in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recalled how in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa Hotel reached the paragliding community, he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to contestants in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue ticks, however, the only response to his messages was a single gray one.
“I think that means the messages were not delivered,” he added.
Thieves charge $26,750 while loading an ATM in Levi's Newport
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was loading an ATM in Levi’s Newport, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to load it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
While the man was busy, another man “came running behind the back of a Brink employee” and stole a bag of money.
Witnesses saw many suspects fleeing the scene, the statement continued, but police did not indicate the number involved in the theft.
Anyone with information on the suspects' identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Along with the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: “The man officially known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change precedes his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande on the show, which he turned down “for emotional reasons,” the show’s creator told us.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously claimed that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I believe ‘yeah’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’ or ‘you,’” West said earlier this year while discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“I am you, I am us, it is us.
He passed from Kanye, which means only one person, just to Ye – which is a reflection of the good in us, of the evil, of the confusion, of everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
The rapper is one of many known in his field who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and titles, including Puff Daddy, P Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the pseudonyms Lion and Brother Lion.
One of West's previous associates, Jay-Z, also introduced himself in a variant with or without a hyphen and/or capital letters in his nickname.
Mexico's president vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed never to use military force as the country nears the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, President L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador vowed "never to use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
Soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people, while student movements with leftist political views gradually spread across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador took an oath to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and opening more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attract young people to criminal gangs.
U.S. to double funding for AI development
At a time when China is becoming increasingly active on the frontline of artificial intelligence development, the U.S. should double its research budget in this area, according to AI researcher and developer Kai-Fu Loi, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment came after various U.S. government units made statements on the topic of AI, although the U.S. as a whole has no official strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: the country aims to become number one in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget to develop AI would be a good start, given that all other countries are well ahead of the U.S. and are about to make further breakthroughs in terms of AI,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could also double the chances of the next big AI achievement coming from the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book, “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order,” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s largest AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon Lee University, he worked on an AI system that beat America’s most successful gamer, then he was executive director at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee paid tribute to the federal government’s previous technology competitions, such as the Advanced Defense Research Projects Agency’s robotics competition, and asked when the next one would be, which would help identify new visionaries.
“Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government funding,” Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking away academic leaders, it’s the corporations,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring university luminaries to work on AI.
Lee also argues that changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. strengthen its AI program.
“I think AI doctors should automatically be offered green cards,” he said.
The U.S. State Council announced its plan to develop next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people from academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund researchers in the U.S., but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center on Artificial Intelligence, which aims to include industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, they are currently investing more than $100 million a year in the development of AI.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which wanted to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not seen any activity in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the name of their country
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum this Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia". It is a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, says its northern neighbour's name represents a claim to its territorial integrity, which is why it vetoes its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he himself would not vote in the referendum, while a campaign to boycott it casts doubt on whether the referendum will be able to reach the minimum 50 percent required to recognize its validity.
The question on the ballots is: “Do you support NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to achieve the entry of the post-Yugoslav state of Macedonia into organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to give my vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, a 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding force, enough members of parliament have said they will take the result into account to such an extent that the vote already has a decisive weight.
In order to change the name of the country, two-thirds of the parliamentary representatives must vote for it.
The state election commission said there had been no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters visited the ballot boxes.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in the referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which will open the way for joining NATO and the European Union, in Strumica on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavadarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and arranging chairs in front of the tents stretched by the boycotters of the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with our heads held high, not through the door for servants," Kavadarkov said.
“Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO membership will lead to the necessary investments for Macedonia, since unemployment in the country is over 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us, as over 80 percent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his own vote.
The statesman also said that the positive result will lead to “affirmation of the future of our people”.
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies published the results of a survey that found that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum – which is below the required activity.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonian television Telma, reported that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policies since it won power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City passes through the entire defense of Brighton and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame the defense of Brighton and brought the victory of Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the "Etihad Stadium" in Manchester, England.
Playing Aguero for his goal in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine goalkeeper was found with a pass in the middle of the field.
He overtook three defenders from Brighton before sprinting the ball into the empty space ahead.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players in green.
He snuck past one of the defenders, then left the rest behind on the border of the Brighton penalty area.
Then he turned left to Stirling.
The English striker with one touch returned the ball back to Aguero, who with a blow with his right foot overcame the goalkeeper of Brighton Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his neck.
“Aguero is struggling with some injuries in his legs,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“I thought he was going to play 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky to score a goal at that point.”
But Sterling was the one who provided the initial advance of the “skyscrapers” in this Premier League match of England.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In the situation for the naked Aguero received a submission deep in the middle of Brighton.
He immediately released a pass on the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane advanced with the ball, then found Sterling with a pass to the far beam.
The striker of the "skyshine" was able to detect up close, shortly before the ball came out.
City will face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group stage match at 12:55 on Tuesday afternoon at the Rain Neckar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to play to determine the fate of the Rockies
Since the Nationals did not qualify for the playoffs, there is no particular sense for another game of the title starting pitcher.
Still, the always-ambitious Sherzer hopes to be the title-holder on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies if the match is relevant to the Rockies, who lead with one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West standings.
The Rockies secured at least a Wild Card game after a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but it’s still not certain they’ll win their first division title.
“Although we are not fighting for anything, we want to finish the season with a good game in Denver, where the audience and the other team will do their best to win perhaps the most important game of the year for them.
Why would I want to miss a game like that?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting pitcher for Sunday, but are expected to allow Scherzer to participate if the match is decisive.
For Scherzer, this would be the 34th game as a starting pitcher this year, as he held a practice on Thursday and would have the normal rest time until Sunday.
Washington's right-handed pitcher has a balance of 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is recruiting supporters in West Virginia.
The president made a blunt reference to the situation with his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican votes in the general election.
“In November, everything we have achieved will be at risk.
There are five weeks left until one of the most important choices of our lives.
“It’s one of the biggest moments in history right now — I’m also saying that while I’m not a candidate, in reality I’m also involved, which is why I’m fighting hard for the right candidates,” Trump said.
“You all see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see them with your own eyes.
They are determined to regain power in any way, you yourself are witnessing their ruthlessness, their malice.
They don’t care when they can hurt, who they have to run over in order to cling to power and government, because they are only interested in power and government, but we will not give them them.
According to the president, the Democrats have set themselves the goal of “obstructing and impeding”.
“What we’ve all seen over the last four days,” he continued, calling Democrats “angry, nasty, mean and unfaithful.”
The president recalled the Senate Judiciary Committee, mentioning Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, which caused strong booing from the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you distribute the document?
Please, what?
No, no, I was waiting — it was a really bad sign — maybe the worst I’ve ever seen.”
Labour is no longer broad-minded.
The party is not tolerant of those who speak openly.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I’m just the last Labour MP to be told he’s not welcome just because I’m being honest.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she resolutely stood up to anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship criticizes me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironically similar to those with which Jeremy disagreed at the time of the previous leaders.
The notice of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that “we want the meetings to include everyone and to be fruitful.”
For most of my eight years as Labour’s local representative in Parliament, Friday’s meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today, the tone of most meetings and promises of a “lighter and more measured” policy have long been forgotten, if ever on the agenda.
It became increasingly clear that differing views were not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion was judged on how much the party leadership liked it.
This started soon after Jeremy became leader, while colleagues I had previously thought shared similar political views began to expect me to make a turnaround and take positions I would never agree with – be it on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I make public statements – no matter what I’m actually saying – a whole insulting tirade follows on social media, where it calls for recall, rejection of moderate politics, claims that I don’t belong to the Labour Party.
Like it doesn't just happen to me.
As a matter of fact, I know that I was even more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments about me are at least mostly of a political nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and purposefulness of those colleagues who face sexist or racist squabbles every day without being afraid of them.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era in politics is how such insults have become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said Labour must embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is far from broad-minded, with every sign of mistrust or change in the rules of choice becoming more and more narrow-minded.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice to calm down, not to talk so much and then “everything will be fine”.
But that’s not why I got into politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student provoked by Thatcher’s government, which through neglect led to the literal collapse of my excellent school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – whether as a local councilor or as a minister.
I never hid my political views, including during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way by my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state rushes to Brexit, it will harm households, businesses and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in reality my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of recall or political excommunication will refuse me to act in the way I consider best to protect your interests.

Air 38-17 Melrose: Invincible Air took the lead in the standings
Both late essays may have changed the final result slightly, but there is no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting match of the Premier League of Tennent.
The team is already at the top of the standings and the only one of the ten teams is unbeaten so far.
Better defense and better use of opportunities proved decisive in the match, from which coach Peter Murchi and his team can be very pleased.
“I’m happy because the other teams have tested us quite seriously in the last games and we’re still unbeaten,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations to Air, they really took advantage of their position better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, followed by a successful extra hit by Frazier Klimo, brought Air forward in the result, but a yellow card for the Scottish national Rory Hughes, released to play in the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to catch up in the result, after Jason Baggott scored an essay, followed by no score.
Klimo increased the lead for Air from a penalty kick shortly before the half, scoring an essay after a solo action, and then realizing the additional kick, thus making the score 17-5 for Air on the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and the essay of Patrick Anderson, followed by a successful additional blow to Bagot, reduced the lead to only five points.
There was a prolonged suspension of the game due to a severe injury to Ruarid Nott, who was carried on a stretcher, and after the resumption of the match Air increased their advance after an essay by Stafford McDowell and a successful additional blow to Klimo.
Then the acting captain of Air Blair McPherson received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of their numerical advantage, exerting strong pressure and realized an essay through Bruce Colvin, followed by an unsuccessful additional blow.
However, the hosts regained the presence of the spirit and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card after knocking Klimo without a ball, from the subsequent criminal play McPherson realized an essay with the help of the advancing offensive line of Air.
Klimo made the extra kick, and not long after he did it again, after Kyle Rowe caught the kicked ball from David Armstrong and led the winger Gregor Henry on the flank for the fifth essay of the hosts.
Still Game star appears to be heading for a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kearnan appears to be heading for a more direct and warm industry after it was discovered he had been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor played Jack Jarvis on the BBC's hit show, of which he is also a screenwriter and one of the two stars along with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphyll.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last for the show, with Kiernan already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refrained from commenting, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kearnan had intended to join Glasgow’s “burgeoning restaurant business.”
"The sea is ours": the landlocked Bolivia hopes that the vessel will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors are constantly patrolling the enclosures with rigging of the naval headquarters in La Paz.
There's an ocean blue flag flying over the public buildings.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: “The sea belongs to us by right.
It is our duty to get it back.”
In all of Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost exit, handed down to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century, is still alive – as is the call to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
In fact, that hope is now at its strongest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by an international court on October 1 after five years of consideration.
"The strength is in Bolivia, there is cheerfulness and unity everywhere, and the country expects a positive result," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the international court on the big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support Bolivia's claim and that after decades of negotiations Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic local president, who is set to head into a contested re-election battle next year, also put a lot and a lot at the court's discretion on Monday.
“We are very close to regaining access to the Pacific,” Morales promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the likelihood of the court making a decision in favor of Bolivia is quite small. Moreover, even if it ruled in her favor, it would not change things into reality.
The Dutch-based UN body does not have the authority to take over the territory of Chile and has ruled that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the international court is only six months after the hearing of the latest arguments indicates that the case is “not complicated”, responds Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have actually hurt it.
“The problem of access to the ocean was inflated by the current government of Bolivia,” Zarate said.
He then hinted that Morales’s bellicose rhetoric had wiped out Chile’s few remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have a normal dialogue after what has happened.
The two countries have not had diplomatic missions with each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was made unusually quickly.
According to him, on Monday Bolivia will have "an incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relations with Chile", as well as a chance to "end 139 years of disagreement by achieving benefits for both sides".
Calzadilla also rejected the idea that Morales – who continues to be one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the problem of access to the ocean as a “political crutch.”
“Bolivia will never give up its right to enter the Pacific,” he added.
“Judgment is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome our past problems.”
North Korea says it won’t pursue nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never proceed with nuclear disarmament first if it is unable to trust Washington.
Ri delivered his speech to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises it made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposing countries in Singapore.
His comments come after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be on the verge of restarting stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting North Korea’s Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri called “empty hope” the idea that continuing with U.S. sanctions and objections to a declaration that would end the Korean War would bring the North to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first making a significant gesture along the path of disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up its arsenal, which it sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to arrange preparations for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the last scream of massive hats that will soon be in the fashion stores next to you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block the sun’s rays, there’s no need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown revealed a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection that wowed the catwalk during Paris Fashion Week.
The rather impractical hats sparked a wave on Instagram in the summer, with designers sending eye-catching creations to baffle the fashion community.
Valentino's prominent proposal was an extravagant beige hat with a feather-like wide periphery that literally swallowed the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewelry-decorated watermelons, a magic hat, and even a pineapple—but they weren’t meant to keep you warm on your head.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and reminded not so much of haute couture as of Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs resembled a full set of snorkeling equipment and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you follow these fashion trends, you’re in luck.
Fashion experts predict that huge hats will soon be sold in fashion stores near you.
The huge hats came shortly after the La Bomba, the two-foot-tall straw hat that was seen on everyone’s heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult of the extremely impractical hat, which took over social networks, led to the emergence of another huge design on the fashion podium – a straw beach bag, almost as big as the one wearing it with a swimsuit model.
The orange-colored raffia bag with raffia fringes and a white leather handle was the eye-catching item in Jacquemus’ La Riviera SS19 collection during Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitide told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer – after the designer has made such a big impression, it will be hard to ignore the demand for large-size accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic excellence, continuing in 2018 with another superb performance of exam results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports disciplines, the arts, music and other social sciences.
With up to 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Association (SCIS), aim to offer the best level of education to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their chosen career and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can draw up and implement a personal curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in a language they understand, your words will reach them.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart.”
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on the English language when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages are the first with the highest success for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high grade of A.
The data, which was collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72% of students achieved an A grade in Chinese, with 72% of German learners having the same grade, 69% of French learners and 63% of Spanish learners having the same grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland perceive foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Currently, languages as a subject of free choice on the part of students receive the same attitude as natural-mathematical disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) both in the programs of independent schools and beyond.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the UK Employment and Skills Commission showed that, of the reasons why employers find it difficult to find employees, 17% indicated insufficient language competences.
Therefore, more and more knowledge of foreign languages is becoming mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more jobs require a command of a foreign language, which makes these skills essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if a person mastered a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future, having mastered such a skill, which remains for life.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in front of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to speak a language, with French being the only language with a double digit rate of 15%.
That is why investing in language learning today is important for children now.
Proficiency in several languages, especially those of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, every school will differ from the languages taught.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages deemed more important to the UK in the future by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child has, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, as teachers will be specialists in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed in life, no matter what the future holds.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredibly important role in the future of any country, which requires this to be taken into account in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellence, to young people in Scotland.
I'll be honest with you.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Association of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut this Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans eager to see LeBron James’ first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will take part in the team's first pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet clear how many minutes he will play in the match.
“He’ll be on the pitch between one and 48 minutes,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudeau said on Twitter that James will probably play a relatively short minute in the game.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six pre-season games.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare for the new season,” he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was the first of five planned Trump rallies that included stops at familiar locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By postponing a confirmatory vote on his choice to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the upcoming mid-term elections as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when they cast their ballots in November.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s visit to Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m., Eastern Time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s visit to Wheeling, West Virginia, below via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to hear this week’s hearings on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have raised tensions over allegations of immoral sexual acts, holding the Senate’s affirmative vote for up to a week while an FBI investigation is underway.
The main goal of this series of rallies, however, is to help Republicans gain momentum for the November election.
President Donald Trump’s campaign said the five rallies next week were aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Control of Congress is so essential to his agenda that the president will visit as many states as possible and we’re starting a campaign season filled with commitments,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The rally tonight, scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania to the attention of Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump’s second visit this month to West Virginia, a state where he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, a Republican who lags behind in polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has come to give him a boost in sociological research," Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Rider Cup 2018: U.S. team will fight to the last, keeping their hopes alive before the singles on Sunday
After three consecutive sessions without the intrigue of “Foursom” matches on Sunday afternoon may have brought what Ryder Cup needed.
Changing the advantage in sports is a rather subjective concept, in which, however, players believe unreservedly, even more so in races like this one.
Which team is in a better position right now?
“They were six points ahead, and now it’s only four, so I guess we’ve gained a bit of momentum,” said Jordan Spite at the end of today’s race day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of four points with only twelve more to allocate.
However, as Spite says, the Americans have more to show and their fans should not lose hope, if we judge by the sportsmanship of Spite and Justin Thomas, who played together throughout the day and each of them took three out of four possible points.
Spit shows excellent form from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the true leader of his team.
The cheers of the fans were getting stronger as he advanced into the round, in which with a precision kick he equalized the result in the fourth game, after he and Thomas were behind by two strokes after the first two holes.
His strike, which won them the match on the 15th hole, was met with strong enthusiastic reactions that make us believe that really not everything is lost for the American team.
“The important thing is to not think about anything else and focus on your own game,” says Spit.
That's all that's left for these players now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Speit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed heroes of the Ryder Cup so far.
The strange but delightful couple from Europe won four out of four and it looks like everything is working out for them.
Moliwood were the only couple who didn’t make “gods” on Sunday afternoon, but they also didn’t have “goddesses” either on Saturday morning, or Friday afternoon, or in the morning.
These consistent successes, as well as the way energy seemed to pass between them and the enthusiastic fans, confirmed the opinion that they are the players who will win on Sunday and there will be no better pair than Fleetwood and Molinari, which will bring a potential victory to Europe as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, the stories of European fame turned out to be a little premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball games this morning, as he partnered with Alex Norén.
"Gods" and two "doubles" of the first nine holes put the Spaniard and the Swede in trouble, which they could not cope with.
However, in Sunday’s matches, there is no way for anyone else to solve your problems.
“Fourball” and “Foursom” matches are extremely interesting to watch closely because of the interactions between the couples, the tips they exchange with each other, and the way a strategy can undergo changes at any time.
Europeans played better team and therefore gained a significant lead before the last day, but this session of “foursom” matches showed that the American team is also ready to fight to the last – something that many people, especially in the United States, strongly doubted.
Europe led 10–6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a solid lead before the last day of the Ryder Cup, after leading the United States 10–6 after playing matches from the Fourball and Foursom formats on Saturday.
The inspiring duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari began with two wins against the inconclusive Tiger Woods, with their asset at the race at Le Golf National growing to four points.
In an attempt to regain the trophy he lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn’s European team dominated the morning’s four-ball games over the Americans, who made a mistake after a mistake, and eventually Europe won the series with 3–1 wins.
The United States put up more resistance in the “fours” matches, where they won two victories, but failed to narrow the gap.
Jim Furik's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first rookie from Europe to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, known by the moniker “Molywood”, after this sensational weekend became only the second couple to win four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After relentlessly beating Woods and Patrick Reed in four-ball matches, they were extremely motivated to beat broken Woods and American rookie Bryson Decambu with an even more categorical score of 5 & 4.
Woods, who barely made it through his two games on Saturday, only occasionally showed off his genius, but so far he has lost 19 of 29 games in fourball and fours games, as well as a total of seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who got a break for the morning Fourball games, partnered with Henrik Stenson in the Foursom clash in the 2&1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copa – the number one and number three in the world, respectively.
However, the European team was not able to enjoy a completely pleasant, cool and cloudless day southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas returned the hopes of the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They scored a difficult 2<0xC2><0xA7>1 win against Spain's John Ram and Ian Polter in the Fourballs, and later returned to beat Polter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the Foursoms, although they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team caught up four points deficit before the singles, according to regulations, the team of Furik will keep the trophy even in a draw.
However, after being outplayed for two consecutive days, it seems that their chances of turning on Sunday are not particularly great.
North Korea says ‘no way’ to disarm unilaterally, without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepen mistrust of the United States and there is no way the country could unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
At the annual general assembly of the world organization, Ri Yong-hou said that over the past year "significant measures of good will" have been taken, for example, stopping nuclear and missile tests, destroying the nuclear test site and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security and under no circumstances will we be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
While Ri expressed North Korea’s familiar complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking step-by-step measures, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri cited a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work for “nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump gave guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘elimination of nuclear weapons first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, and even objects to the ‘declaration of the end of the war,’” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a meaningless dream of those who do not know us.
The problem, however, is that continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention whether a second meeting between Kim and Trump was planned, which the U.S. leader stressed at the U.N. earlier this week.
Instead, the minister focused on the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the country on the issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea, not the United States, the elimination of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a standstill.
However, Ri’s tone of speech was markedly different from the previous year when he told the U.N. General Assembly that directing North Korean missiles at the U.S. mainland was inevitable after the “evil president” Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea with “total destruction,” praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea removed its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump stressed that there was no deadline and said, “It doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years, or five months.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the implementation of Security Council sanctions must necessarily continue until complete, final and verified nuclear disarmament takes place.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in a bid to halt funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year, Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last trip went well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but only hours later North Korea accused him of making "gangster demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to destroy a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took “appropriate measures.”
According to him, Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” to which he aspires are the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and that he wants to achieve normalization of relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard on a course for sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year causes all students to sleep more in an attempt to combat the growing culture of learning “all night” with the help of caffeine.
A lecturer found that students at the world’s number one university often don’t even think about the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Keisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, prepared the course he believes to be the first of its kind in the U.S.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“Finally, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are they telling me this now, in my senior year?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is taking place for the first time this year, explains to students the essentials of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after it was found that students suffered from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a dorm room where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers, and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of bedtime routines.
Another part of the participants told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know the health effects of your choice to smoke.”
The culture of pride in “learning all night long” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students mean sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Getting enough quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” for students to fight stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he says — even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Keisler prepare the course by taking one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He says the course “opened his eyes” and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
It hopes that the next step is for all graduates to be asked to complete a similar curriculum before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Keisler recommends that students think about setting up a bedtime and wake-up alarm, and know the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Menga’s goal crushed Gerard’s team
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's shot broke Steven Gerard's idealess team and brought a 1–0 win for Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first win as a 4–1 away win over St. Johnston in February, but Gary Holt's team scored only Gerard's second defeat in his 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points short of the breakaway team of Harts, Ladbroke's Premier League leader.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the devoid of constructive ideas team of the Rangers at no point seemed close to the level.
After the match, the Rangers were knocked down in sixth place, and Livingston are already third, lagging behind the second Hibernian only by a goal difference.
For the Rangers, there may be additional problems, as side referee Callum Spence received a head wound after being hit with an object that was apparently thrown by the guests’ fans.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that defeated Air in the semifinals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came up with the same Livingston eleven that pulled a point against the Harts last week, and he should be pleased with the way his aggressive team parried all the opponent’s actions.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but Livingston did better on the rarer occasions when they owned it.
They should have scored in the second minute, when Menga brought with one touch Scott Pittman against goalkeeper Alan McGregor, but the midfielder missed the good opportunity.
Later centering Keegan Jacobs from a foul found Captain Craig Halket, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow deflected the ball away from the back beam.
Rangers took control of the game, but failed to create anything meaningful in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought that there should be a penalty in the 15th minute when he faced Stephen Lawless, but the referee Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian’s claims.
The Rangers made only two accurate shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily coped with the blow with the head of Lasana Coulibaly and with the weak shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's goal in the 34th minute was surprising in terms of possession of the ball, it was fully deserved.
The Rangers again failed to deal with Jacobs' deep centering.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher pointed the ball at Scott Robinson, who handed it to Menga in cold blood, for whom it was easy to realize.
Gerard reacted to the break by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this shift almost immediately led to a result when the wing handed over to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the blow.
Livingston, however, continued to force guests to play in a style of play comfortable for the hosts, with Lithgow and Halket constantly beating off the long balls sent forward.
Holt's team could increase their lead in the last minutes, but McGregor was able to cope with the impact of Jacobs, and in the next corner Litgow shot his head past the beam.
Glen Middleton of the Rangers asked for a penalty at the end of the match after a duel with Jacobs, but Thomson again did not see anything wrong in the situation.
Yearbook: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
Page from our yearbook Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and Counting... the day the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
A cornerstone in science since then, the Geiger counter also became a cornerstone of pop culture when the 1950 film Coronado Bells was released, featuring the seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: “What in God’s name is this?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “Certainly it’s shooting right now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery, which bears his name, continues to live.
New cancer vaccine could train immune system to ‘see’ foreign cells
New cancer vaccine could train immune system to ‘see’ foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them in a laboratory.
They can then “see” a protein that is common to many types of cancer and are injected back into the patient.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which trains her immune system to recognize foreign cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them in a laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to many types of cancer called HER2 and then inject them back into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Prof. Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach of making immune cells from patients and “training” them how to target cancer cells was used in the treatment of a type of leukemia.

It didn't go well.
Kenny West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after performing a meaningless performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat that read “Let’s Make America Great Again,” he went against the Democrats and declared his support for Trump.
“I often talk to white people and they ask me, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL kicked off a show featuring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault complaints made by Christine Blaise Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's performance was uploaded to social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear why Rock tried to mock West with his publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of his hat.
“I was caught behind the scenes.
I was told, "Don't go out with that hat."
I've been bullied!
And then they say I’m on a sinking ship,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continues, "Do you want to see the sinking ship?", claiming that he will put on the Superman suit, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love.”
The comments caused at least two booings from the audience and SNL team members looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one of them saying, "The whole studio went silent."
West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with the performance of the song "I Love It", dressed as a bottle of "Perrier".
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of the bravest: THANK YOU for standing up to the crowd.”
The talk show's host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was "just being herself, and that's wonderful."
“But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’) who I think welcomes and spreads an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
So are we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, now "known officially as Kenny West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows the example of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His friend, rapper Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lyon, and music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol.
Man charged with attempted murder after stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecutor’s office.
'Game of Thrones' star Keith Harrington is against toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is known for his role as the swinging sword John Snow in the violent medieval fantasy HBO series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, who is 31 years old, has spoken out against the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen often leads young people to think that they have to be “cruel” in order to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed “something went wrong” and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner Rose Leslie, also 31, admits that he feels “firmly convinced” that this problem should be solved.
“At the moment, I am personally firmly convinced – what have we done wrong in terms of masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach adolescent men about the problem we see now?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the many masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What is being taught on TV and on the street that makes guys feel they need to become this particular type of men?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time – how do we change it?
Because obviously something is wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in a prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones after the series ended next summer, claiming that he was "completed with the battlefields and the horses."
From November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard’s “True West” re-enactment, a story about a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor said that getting to know his wife Rose was the best thing that happened in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on this show, so that’s how he gave me my future family and determined my life for the future,” he said.
Rose plays Igrith, the girl Kit's character Jon Snow falls in love with, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family’s estate in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health services, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The majority of new cases are caused by sexual contact, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, China's health services said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, every year the number of those living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in the KGB communities is widespread.
According to studies, because of conservative values, 70-90% of men who have had sexual intercourse with men end up marrying women.
Many cases of transmission of diseases are due to improper protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government pledged to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking Republican senators' data, denounces "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team published personal information of three Republican senators on the pages of lawmakers on Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were made by experts and ultra-right wing sites.
“Lies, lies and more disgusting lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, who are from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitol during a Senate hearing on allegations of immoral sexual behavior against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak took place after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the posts was linked to Waters’ office, and leaked information about a member of her team, according to Hill.
“This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and is an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my team – whose identity, personal information and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations – is in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and is an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“There is poison in this denial,” Fleischer wrote.
“That suggests she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
He shouldn't be so defiant.
I must not question the prosecutor's motives.
He needs to be calm and balanced.”
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of looking angry at the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters’s seat in the midterm elections, also took to Twitter.
“Importantly, if true,” he wrote.
In a statement, Waters said her office had referred these fraudulent allegations to the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they are held legally accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team.”
Johnny English is Exploding Again: The Weak Spy Parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now traditional to look for references to Brexit in any new British film, and it seems that this also applies to the revival of the action-comedy spy franchise for Johnny English – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will self-deprecation and facial expressions that show how obviously stupid we are become a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes wide open and his face “rubbery”, is allowed to renew things for the second time – his name is of the greatest importance when it comes to a great comic creation intended for fans of cinema who do not speak English.
He is, of course, a foolish secret agent who, despite his strange claims of flattering brilliance, owns little of Clouseau, little of Mr Bean, and much of the man who contributed a single note to the musical theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also based on the chaos of an international man, played by Atkinson in Barclaycard’s now-forgotten television commercials.
In the last movie with Johnny English, there are two good moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter carrying in medieval armor and for a short while the fins jammed into his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to physical comedy is obvious, but humor is rather weak and oddly superfluous, especially when "serious" film brands such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" include a dose of comedy.
The humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and Johnny English’s crazy accidents are not innovative and focused in my opinion, since Actinson’s no-game reminds Mr. Bean.
It is always the current assumption that the UK is facing serious problems.
A cyber-hacker has hacked into Britain’s super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all operatives to the horror of the on-call agent – unfortunately a small role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last straw for the prime minister, who is an inflated and pompous figure and already suffers from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best for this quasi-Theresa-May role, but in the script there is nothing to work with.
Her intelligence advisers informed her that she should call some retired agent, since all acting agents were compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who currently works as a teacher in a chic center, but who illegally teaches lessons on how to be an undercover agent: there are some good hits here when English recreates a spy rock academy.
English is called to Whitehall for emergency briefing and reunites with his former longtime assistant Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a family man, married to a submarine commander, a hilarious role in which Vicky Pepperdine's talent is a little squandered.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the big problems of Her Majesty’s secret services and face the fatally beautiful Ofelia Buletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister finds himself under the dangerous influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo begin their odyssey of farces: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos when sneaking onto Volta's luxury yacht; and English causes a veritable anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to explore the interior of Volta's house.
All the jokes are certainly taken from the previous film, but since so cute and lush, here there is a lot more content designed for children.
It's a pretty mediocre production.
As with other Johnny English films, I keep thinking: can’t the British film industry give Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour says it is developing a plan for Britons to work four days a week but get paid five days a week.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would see Britons work four weeks but get paid five.
The party says it wants company bosses to provide the savings made through revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them another day off.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but get the same pay.
The sources say the idea would “fit” the economic program and the party’s plans to shake the country to the benefit of the workers.
The move to a four-day workweek has been approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected before the end of the year.
“It’s not going to happen right away, but the four-day work week is an aspiration that fits into the approach of rebalancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this aspiration does not meet the approval of the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not in the party’s policy of not considering it.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour conference to unveil his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from the “faceless directors” and “speculators” of utilities firms.
The chancellor’s shadow plans also mean that current owners of shares in water companies may not receive their full stake, as the Labour government could impose “deductibles” on the basis of the violations found.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and set up privatisation funds to transfer 10 per cent of the net capital of private firms to employees who could accrue annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John F. Kennedy talk to 60 Minutes about whether the FBI’s Kavanaugh investigation could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the bureau’s findings could lead some of the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, after this statement came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, categorical and unambiguous."
However, Graham’s voice seemed uncompromising.
“I have an opinion about Brett Kavanaugh, and to change that, it takes a shattering indictment,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it categorically,” Graham added, addressing Christine Blassy Ford.
“And no one she mentioned, but she could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and does it help reduce poverty at all?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive cast of performers and carries out an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty around the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people on the Central Park lawn, who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but will also learn about the true purpose of the event – the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a follow-up to the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a number of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending no email to a world leader, calling on the phone, or otherwise connecting to help raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful is the “Global Citizen” 12 years before it achieves its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a brilliant way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “clicticism” – people think they’re doing something meaningful when they sign an online petition or post on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions” by its supporters, who are pushing for a variety of different goals.
These actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies amounting to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 engagements and messages stemming from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid or collected.
The group believes that the funds provided have already directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include “The Power of Nutrition,” a UK-based partnership between investors and contractors, a commitment to “helping children reach their full potential,” which promises to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter posts from “global citizens.”
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a mere historical footnote,” said Tracy Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions had been taken calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government had announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, that would reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the FAQs on his website asking, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fail and then we will fail again.
But just as with the great civil rights movement and the anti-apartheid movement before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are just some of the performers at this year’s event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. may use naval force to ‘block’ and impede energy exports – Home Secretary
Washington may, if necessary, resort to its naval forces to prevent Russian energy products from entering markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zink revealed, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zink argues that Russia’s involvement in Syria — specifically, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government — is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe the reason they’re in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, just like they did in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can, through our naval forces, ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, block them to make sure that energy products don’t reach the market,” he said.
Zink addressed attendees at the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that presents itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He aimed to compare Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are the same.
“The economic option for Iraq and Russia is, more or less, to stimulate and replace fuel,” he said, while at the same time defining Russia as a “pony with one number,” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration is tasked with boosting liquefied gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says is turning Berlin into a “hostage.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s ardent opposition to the project is dictated simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (DBDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third party interferes in our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look at the 2020 presidential bid, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "take a serious look" at the presidential run-off after the midterm elections.
During a town council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will take a serious look at the presidential candidacy.”
Warren expressed his judgment on President Donald Trump during the city council, saying he was “leading this country in the wrong direction.
“I worry to the bottom of my heart, as Donald Trump does with our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Warren said “of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
A poll conducted on Thursday, however, showed that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe study.
Thirty-two percent supported this nomination.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent in favor and 48 percent against.
Other senior Democratic officials discussed regarding a potential 2020 run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points out PTSD on Track Palin at Donald Trump rally
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recording in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my own son is going through after I return is familiar to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming home with,” she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest an “elephant in the room” and said of his son and other war veterans that “they come back a little changed, hardened, coming back and wondering if they’re going to get that respect that they and they and their brothers in arms gave to the country.”
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, included in a report on domestic violence and possession of a gun in a drunken state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasila police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a lawsuit challenging a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gang and domestic violence.
On Friday, officials from 18 states and counties filed a goodwill petition in Washington in support of asylum seekers and contesting the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August, has not been disclosed.
She claimed that her partner “and the sons of violent gang members” had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected the asylum application on July 20.
She's being held in Texas.
U.S. lawyers who help Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which large numbers of asylum seekers come to the U.S., as nations facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy returned a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District attorney Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be examined according to specific facts and circumstances, and such a ban violates this principle,” the report said.
In addition, lawyers argued in the report that policies that deny entry to immigrants harm the U.S. economy, pointing out that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary labor.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
“Shelter is given to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political beliefs,” Sessions said in a July 11 statement on the policy.
Shelter was never meant to alleviate all the problems—not even all the serious ones—that people face every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate Rescue Efforts in Palu as Deaths Double in Search of Survivors
The situation for the survivors is getting worse.
“I feel very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her sick boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute the ambulance carries more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents are seen returning to their destroyed homes to try to salvage something from their flooded belongings.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered a fractured spine and shoulder, were placed outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients are being treated outdoors due to ongoing secondary tremors.
His eyes fill with tears when he remembers feeling the violent earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I think I was pinned down in a broken wall,” Harris told The Associated Press, adding that he had come to the city with his family to attend a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then she stopped.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of ‘bullying’ with ‘propaganda ads’
A week after an official newspaper in China ran a four-page advertisement in an American daily on the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump cited a paid China Daily publication in the Des Moines Register — the best-selling newspaper in Iowa — after accusing China of seeking to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections.
Trump’s accusation that Peki is trying to meddle in the U.S. congressional election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war in which they are leveling tariffs on imports between countries.
According to experts from the United States and China, at the beginning of the trade war, customs tariffs in China were intended to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that support Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a commentary in the weekly Des Moines Register, “is currently doubling this harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government has taken advantage of America’s respected tradition of freedom of speech and the press by running paid ads on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at the newspaper stand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited statements and will not see a true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese people may have on China’s troubling economic trajectory, given that the media is under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers has avoided the offer to publish” his article, although he did not specify which one.
With Kavanaugh’s pogrom, Republicans are pushing back female voters for midterm elections, analysts warn
As many high-profile Republicans back and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on several sexual assault charges, analysts warned there would be a backlash, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around the tray are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already noted that they want to continue with the vote.
These things can’t be reversed,” Grant Raher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Raher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute push for an FBI investigation would be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday — they will not forget it either tomorrow or in November,” Karin Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, told The Washington Post on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” during a demonstration in the Senate hallway as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasy Ford.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be ruled out,” Stu Rotenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news outlet.
“People say the problem is already serious; it’s true.
But it can get even more serious, especially among suburban women voters and younger voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested there might be a backlash if Republicans insist on confirming the nomination.
“This has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh was put on the bench. It’s about the way Republicans handle it and how they treat it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
Americans, however, seem somewhat divided on the question of who to trust as a result of the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, a little more inclined to the second.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford’s testimony, and 35 percent say they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent say they think Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent say the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s insistence, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s allegations, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh attacked her intoxicated when she was 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court candidate showed his genitals to her while they were at a party during her Yale studies in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch new internet to attack Google and Facebook
World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee is launching a venture that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds the Berners-Lee Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said of the venture.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “online personal data store” or POD.
It contains lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available through any browser, and at the same time it is all of them at the same time.
What is unique about the online personal data repository is that the user determines who has access to what information.
The company calls it “giving authority to personal data.”
The idea behind Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is for the company to invest resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help Solid become accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several developers contracted to work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a complete change when all their business models are completely updated overnight.
“We don’t want permission from them.”
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to provide energy for commerce and the ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had a strong influence in the net neutrality debate.
Despite the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: in memory of the priest awarded the Victoria Cross in the First World War
It marks 100 years in the home town of the only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross for his service in World War I.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, not realizing that he had been awarded the highest military honors in Britain.
A memorial was unveiled Saturday by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was “extremely symbolic” that the monument be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s medal-winning work.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt. Col. Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very thick fog and under heavy artillery and machine gun fire."
He later attacked the firing line and with "incredible bravery" led the line forward before attacking an artillery piece with one hand and killing three of the squad.
Lt. Col. Wang was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never do, but it makes me humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, put on a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said it was "a great honor to participate in the parade" and added "the true hero's virtue is demonstrated through the support that will be given to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead got Peppa Pig
Imagine waiting all night to watch a full edition of the Bellator 206 and finally not being able to witness the main event.
The program from San Jose contained 13 matches, including six from the main map, and had to be broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Geghard Musashi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were stunned when the show changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after waking up to the early hours, especially because of the match.
Fan described the switch to the children’s animated film on Twitter as “some sick joke.”
“The government regulates that at 6 a.m. this content is not appropriate, so the program was replaced with a children’s show,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, said in response to a question about the broadcast.
"Peppa pig," yes.
Bellator president Scott Cocker said he would work on scheduling the meetings to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“In my opinion, when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem,” Cocker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on Sunday and we can’t plan things so that here the event takes place on Sunday, and there – on Monday.
We're working on it, though.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we received a lot of messages and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that. It was government.
I can promise you, next time it won't happen.
We will stick to the inclusion of five matches instead of six – as we usually do. We tried to give more to the fans, but we overdid it.
This is an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly felt 'lower' because of his sexuality
Olympic water-jumper Tom Daly says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old claims that until he started high school, he didn’t realize that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview with the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he spoke about gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he became less interested in winning the Olympics.
The longtime host of the show, Kirsty Young, has been in the hospital for several months.
On Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else when he was growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like both girls and boys."
He said, “To this day, feeling inferior and being different from others are actually the things that give me the energy and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove he was “something,” he said, so he wouldn’t disappoint anyone when he eventually learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in LGBT campaigns and used his participation in this year’s British Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he was doing this because he was happy to be able to live openly, without consequences, and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man - American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - he was "surprised."
Daley married the Oscar-winning actor, who is 20 years his senior, last year, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
“When you go through so much while you’re so young” – he first participated in the Olympics at 14, and his father died of cancer three years later – he said – “it’s hard to find someone your age who has experienced similar ups and downs.”
The couple became parents in June and have a son, Robert Ray Black-Daily, who says his "whole worldview" has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that I was only interested in winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn’t accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics – because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to be there for me, Dad, not even in the front row,’” he said.
“I held his hand until he stopped breathing and at that point when I found out he was dead, I finally admitted he wasn’t invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that all my life I had dreamed about it – to jump at the Olympic Games in front of the audience at home. There was no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song – “Proud” by Heather Small – which accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympic Games and still makes him cringe.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m., British Summer Time.
Lost form Mickelson will stay on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
Phil Mikkelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to regain his old form if he does not want his record to be associated with failure.
Mickelson, who participated in the two-year event for the record-breaking 12th time, was left on the bench by captain Jim Furick for the fourball and fours games on Saturday.
Instead of once again being a major figure in the US team, the five-time winner of major tournaments spent his day as a fan and in training his shots from a distance in the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete, who has never been among the straightest players even at the height of his career, is not in optimal shape for Le Golf National’s difficult pitch, where long rough terrain usually punishes any mishit.
And if the pitch itself isn’t disturbing enough, in Sunday’s ninth game, Michelson will face precision British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who is teaming up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and aiming to win all four of his games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind before the 12 games of singles, make a strong start, it may turn out that the match of Mikkelson is absolutely crucial.
Furik expressed confidence in his team-mate, although he could hardly say anything very different.
“He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furik said.
“He is confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has given so much both in the past and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play in only two games.
I expected him to play more, but it just happened and we believe that we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play like everybody else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo’s record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This could put an end to his career in the Ryder Cup, which never came close to his impressive individual achievements.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furik said his presence brings other benefits to the team that are not measured in numbers.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke with people and is a great guy for any team,” he said.
“I think the younger players had fun with him, especially this week.
He gives a lot more than just playing.”
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, is aware that the big lead may soon be melted
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows from personal experience that the great lead gained before the singles matches of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily be erased.
The Dane made his debut in the game of Valderrama in 1997, when the team with captain Seve Ballisteros led by five points ahead of the Americans, but exactly on the final line was almost overtaken and barely managed to hold the victory with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline where we lost and at Valderrama we won but very hard,” Bjorn said after the 2018 European team won 5–3 sessions on Friday and yesterday, leading 10–6 at National Golf.
So the story has to show me and everyone on the team that it’s not all over.
Be ready to attack tomorrow.
Go out and do what you have to do.
Nothing is over until you see the end result on the board.
We have a goal and it is to try to win this trophy and that is where we have to stay focused.
I kept saying I only think about the 12 players on our team, but we’re also aware of our rivals, who are some of the greatest players in the world.”
Satisfied with the performance of the players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never rush the celebrations.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, the individual performances will come to the fore, and this is different.
It’s great to be there with a partner when things are going well, but when you go out on your own, then you’re putting your full potential as a golfer to the test.
This is the message that should reach the players: tomorrow you have to give your best.
Now you can turn your back on your partner, as he too needs to be dealt to the end.”
Unlike Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn, rival captain Jim Furik will ask his players to perform better individually than as partners, with the only exceptions being Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four possible points.
Furik himself was on both sides of these big comebacks on the last day – he was part of the triumph of “Brookline” and then on the losing side when the Europeans performed the “Miracle of Medinah”.
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, led his players on the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but it would be good if you made the same good start that you saw at Brooklyn as you did at Medina.
When the advantage moves from one direction to the other, these intermediate matches are played under tremendous pressure.
That’s why we’ve formed our squad and distributed our boys the way we want to, to try to do the impossible tomorrow.”
Thomas is tasked with leading our counterattack and facing Rory McIlroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter will meet the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
“I chose these players in that order because I think it gives us the best chance of success,” Bjorn said of his choice for the singles.
Germany Delays Launch of New Warship
The German Navy’s newest frigate was due to be commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but that won’t happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and skyrocketing costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the brand of new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted a spokesman for the army.
The vessel was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understandable that they will have a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, e.g. reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the latest frigates should be able to be used for up to two years before returning to their home ports.
Continuous delays, however, mean that the vanguard warships — which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power overseas — will be old when they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have cited a number of significant "software and hardware defects" that make the warship unusable if sent on a combat mission.
The software flaws are particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship was significantly overloaded, which reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – is also becoming a problem.
It is estimated to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – up from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, admitted that the fleet was actually “exhausting from ships capable of carrying out missions.”
The official said the problem had become bigger over time as the old ships were decommissioned but no new ones were provided.
He complained that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate could join the fleet.
The National Trust tracks the secret life of bats
A new study, carried out in a mansion in the Scottish mountains, aims to find out how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation actions.
The study by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland will follow the common bats as well as the brown arrow-eared aquatic nightgowns at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key places in the mansion to track the activities of bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of invocational sounds of bats, as well as which species emit them.
After that, a habitat map and a report will be drawn up to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management work, e.g. the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK as a whole have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their shelters and lead to habitat loss.
Populations may be at risk from wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use an advanced echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles along their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of great importance and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
The trust has trained experts who conduct regular surveys, asylum inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even created Scotland’s first and only special bat reserve at the Threat Manor in Dumfries and Galway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
The manager of the estate, David Thompson, says it's perfect territory for them.
“Here at Threat, we have a great pitch for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, many old trees and a suitable habitat completed.
But there’s a lot more about bats that aren’t known, so the work we’re doing here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stresses that it is important to check for the presence of bats before property maintenance activities are carried out, as it is possible that the inadvertent destruction of a shelter will kill up to 400 female and young bats, as well as destroy an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their shelters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee at the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and about many of our animal species because we just don’t know what’s going on with their populations.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Claims and Lawyers Will Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying people "want to become famous" using his name.
His lawyers are suing the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker was accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He then allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In an Instagram video addressing his 142 million followers, a few hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33, denounced the publication as “fake news”.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball winner told the camera.
“They want to be famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to gain popularity on my back, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the footballer smiled.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for what they call “unacceptable publication of privacy suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer will seek compensation for "moral damages in an amount commensurate with the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the player’s room, where it is alleged that he raped her anal, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told her he was a "good boy" of "99 percent", but in the case he simply succumbed to the "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had had sex, but this happened with her consent.
Mayorga also claimed she went to the police and had pictures taken of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt “horrified of revenge” and worried about being “publicly humiliated.”
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the agreement as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer moved to the Italian giant Juventus for the sum of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK ‘will regret forever’ losing carmakers
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will “regret forever” if it loses its status as a world leader in post-Brexit car manufacturing, business secretary Greg Clark said on Thursday.
He added that it was “worrying” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” he said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of a delay at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant – where the Auris and Avensis models are produced – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s director at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have voiced concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks to the supply chain in cases of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from both UK and EU suppliers for custom-made cars.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be problems at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to wait more than a day to fill out its inventory at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's "chess" plan for a future relationship with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks."
“We need to have a deal. We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to be able to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“Following the claims not only of Toyota but also of other manufacturers, we are absolutely convinced that we should be able to continue to provide successful supply chains.”
Toyota cannot say how long production will be halted, but in the longer term they warn that the additional costs will reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsvalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite union at the plant, said that its members are increasingly worried: “My experience is that if these jobs go away, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have set out a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump-Rosenstein meeting could be postponed again, White House says
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A landmark meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s fight continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election meddling, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and the president’s potential obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general or not, and thus threaten Mueller’s independence, has fueled rumors about Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies this claim.
But last Monday, he went to the White House after reports that he would resign.
Instead, while Trump was at the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting with him was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which was testified to by both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment – Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into Kavanaugh’s complaints, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “There’s still no set date for that, it could be this week, but seeing all the other things going on in the Supreme Court, I think it could be postponed to next week.
But we'll see, and I always try to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since Sept. 10.
The show's host Chris Wallace asked about the reason.
Sanders responded that the rare press conferences were not due to dislike for the "demonstrative behavior" of television journalists, although he said: "I can't say I disagree with the fact that they have demonstrative behavior."
She then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president has had more Q&A sessions than any president before him,” she said, adding without citing evidence: “We’ve checked these statistics.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but “if the press has a chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, that’s far better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, and you've seen us practice it quite often in recent weeks, and that will replace press conferences once you have the opportunity to talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and at times strange behavior in front of the assembled journalists.
Health minister addresses EU workers at Scotland’s National Health Service over Brexit fears
The health minister wrote to EU staff working at Scotland’s National Health Service to express the country’s appreciation and desire for them to remain in their post-Brexit positions.
Gene Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter to the less than six months before Britain leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to the costs of the established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving have continued, with decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government is also making progress in its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I want to remind you how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond contribute with valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the performance of health services, benefiting the patients and the communities we serve.
“Scotland is definitely your home and we would love for you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday’s game when his team lost to Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27, Tennessee’s Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury happened shortly before halftime.
“He went to the side line and sort of just fainted there,” Reed said.
Coaches and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on a stretcher and taken to the dressing rooms for further examination.
A Tennessee State official confirmed to Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are still no details about the type/seriousness of the injury,” and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore with a college scholarship, is in his first season in Tennessee State since his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday, he made a total of five blocks before leaving the match, making a total of 18 blocks for him this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK
Under new Conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK, with additional funds to help the homeless.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters.
The increase in the stamp duty will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury is expecting an increase of over <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today the decision of foreign buyers to pay a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK, with additional revenue going to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters by promising more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in the stamp duty will affect individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional revenue helping the government’s efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The supplement – which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and properties purchased for rent – could amount to up to three percent.
The Treasury expects revenues to rise by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Around 13 per cent of newly built buildings in London are purchased by people with citizenship outside the UK, leading to higher prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to intervene in the property market.
Many of the rich areas – especially in the capital – have become ghost towns, due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the stamp duty to help more young people own their first home.
He accused major construction companies of maintaining high property prices by looting land but not using it, and asked Mrs May to abandon affordable housing quotas to fix Britain’s “shame on housing”.
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of housing reform proposals, including rent controls and an end to "no guilt" expulsions.
He also wants to give councils more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I shared that I would like to dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who wish to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not right for non-UK residents, as well as foreign companies, to buy homes as easily as hard-working UK residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has drifted too far in time, and the insult of sleeping on the street remains too realistic.”
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his "greatest ambition" in his career was to coach Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman accepted the challenge to revive the club from the north-east of England, which is currently in third place in the First League, three points from the first place.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded one match for the B team and that was it,” Ross told BBC Sportssound.
“But I grew up with the Scottish games at Hampden, which my father and I watched as a child, so the national team has always attracted me.
“But this opportunity would only open up if I had success at club level.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paolo Di Canio.
Aloah Athletic’s former coach said he was not worried about inheriting such established names at such a famous club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success right now will be measured by a positive answer to the question ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Because in terms of structure, base and conditions, he is undoubtedly at the level of the Premier League," he said.
“It will not be easy to return to the highest level of football, but I will accept that I have achieved success here only if I can lead the team there again.”
Ross has been a manager for only three years after spending some time as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months at Harts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alois not to fall into the Third Division and turned St Mirren from a relegated team into a Championship winner the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he did during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlipoul, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“I was really at a crossroads,” he remembers the time when Aloah took over.
“I really believed that being a manager was the best thing for me, including being an active player.
It sounds strange, because I was doing well, making good money and having some significant success.
Being a player is hard sometimes.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I still face the same levels of stress and tension at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager, and now that I do, I’ve never felt more comfortable in my own skin in my entire adult life.”

The ideal time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, study reveals
The summer heat has boosted revenue for struggling British pubs, but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups of pubs and bars reported a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurant revenue fell 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of the CGA, which compiled the statistics, said: “Due to the long sunny weather and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Cup, July followed a similar pattern as June, when pubs saw growth of 2.8 percent, but restaurants received an even stronger blow.
The decline of 1.8 percent in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
Pubs and bars for drinks reported the best results in their growth, compared to the downward movement of restaurants.
Pubs with food also suffered from sunny weather, but not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales jumped 6.6 percent month-on-month, while food sales were down 3 percent.”
Paul Newman, RSM’s leisure and entertainment analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we observed at the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home services sector.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups continue to suffer, though a 4.8 percent year-on-year decline in sales could be particularly painful in addition to the constant costs.
The long hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for food managers, and only time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will bring the much-desired holiday.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the rollout of the brands.

One in five children hides a secret social media profile from their parents
One in five children — some as young as 11 — have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers, a study has found.
Survey of 20,000 High School Students Shows Growth in Fake Insta Pages
The news has raised fears that sexually explicit material is being published.
Twenty percent of students said they had a “core” profile that they showed to their parents
One in five children – some one in 11 – creates a social media account that keeps adults a secret.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed a rise in fake Insta accounts – a link to Instagram’s photo-sharing site.
The news has raised fears of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clear “core” profile, which they showed to their parents, while also having secret profiles.
A mother who stumbled on the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenage child who encouraged others to “rape” him.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, with half of them admitting to keeping their profiles secret.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: “It’s worrying that so many teens are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be ‘Athlete’s Voice’ at Scotland’s Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle was selected to join the Scottish Athletics Board as non-executive director at the governing body’s annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most accomplished athlete, and Chairman Ian Beatty has described the move as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Aileed enjoys tremendous respect in the athletic communities of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from her attraction,” Beatty said.
Doyle said: "I have a desire to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help promote sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200- and 400-meter finals at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, adding to his four Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular commentator at the BBC, lost the ability to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I achieved a full recovery, learned to walk again, and today I do mobility training!
Thanks for the encouraging messages!”
Ad for a breast pump that compares mothers to cows, sections online reviews
A company that makes breast pumps has split online posts with an ad that compares nursing mothers to cows that are breastfed.
To mark the launch of the world’s expected “world’s first wearable silent breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie launched a mock music-video ad to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump gives breastfeeding mothers to express themselves.
Four real moms are dancing in a cow barn full of hay against a background of a song with lyrics including: “Yes, I’m milking, but you can’t see any tail” and “If you haven’t noticed, this is not a udder, these are my breasts.”
The chorus continues: “Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, milk your girlfriends.”
However, advertising posted on the company’s Facebook page caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it downplayed the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very stupid decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take them away a few days after birth,” someone wrote.

Another comment: “It is quite understandable that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?”
Someone else added, "Such inadequate advertising."
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting she found the song "extremely fun."
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
Squeezing made me feel just like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I accept it for what it is.
This product is brilliant,” someone wrote.
Another comment: “This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who strain (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an advertisement praising or condemning the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they danced with the discrete pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many women who breastfeed feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or pipes, and assembles discreetly in a nursing bra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go outside while draining.
Ana Balarin, Partner and Executive Creative Director at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to breast milk pumping and all the challenges associated with it, while at the same time showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children jumped sharply, although monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policy made it difficult to house children with guardians.
Usually, most guardians are undocumented immigrants who are afraid of risking their stay in the country if they want to recognize a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adults in the family must provide fingerprints, and this data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wanted to become guardians of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
“Nearly 80 percent of those who are either guardians or family members of guardians reside illegally in the country, most of whom are foreign criminals.
So we will continue to pursue these individuals,” Albens said.
In an effort to cope more quickly with the registration of these children, authorities have imposed new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than 60 days, as was the previous norm, according to shelter officials.
Many appear in video conferencing rather than in person to present their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer children stay in detention, the more likely they are to become depressed or depressed, which could lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter officials and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said this concern is growing at large facilities, such as in Tornillo, where signs that a child is having problems are more likely to be ignored because of the scale of the site.
They added that moving children to the “palace city” without giving them enough time to prepare on an emotional level or say goodbye to their friends could exacerbate the trauma many are already struggling with.
Syria Urges U.S., French and Turkish ‘Occupational Troops’ to Withdraw Immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the civil war that has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign troops were illegally staying on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "appropriate action will be taken against them".
"They should be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Muallem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been forcibly displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “to fight in this holy battle until all Syrian lands are cleared” of both terrorist organizations and “any illegal presence of foreigners.”
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria who mainly train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian forces, opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-ravaged country.
Regarding refugees, Muallem said conditions were tolerable and could return, accusing "some Western countries of "inspiring groundless fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to assist in these returns," he said.
“They are turning into a political issue something that is entirely a humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be given to rebuild Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib provided an opportunity for progress in political dialogue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Muallem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear timelines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, who "will be destroyed."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of the new committee, made up of members of the government and opposition, to draft Syria’s post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Muallem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the panel’s work should be limited to a “review of the articles of the current constitution” and warned there should be no interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
By this logic, Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless – as many liberal viewers probably hope – his presidency is terminated prematurely because of impeachment and scandal.
This would no doubt be “the most dramatic end of a presidency ever!”
At the moment, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, the primetime rating has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during primetime, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show tops the cable TV ratings, with up to 3.5 million viewers at big news dinners.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neil Baer, executive producer of the ABC drama The Last Candidate, which tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovel, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club, has another theory.
She remembers driving in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, “Why?”
Mrs. Scovel told me that he replied, “Because it makes me laugh.”
There's fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else shown on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Rowe vs. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite, and the state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, the desire to be an informed citizen doesn’t match watching a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who uses “deep historical information” as a source for his book “Fear”; Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-skin pilot jacket (“dressed with the stuffing of arrogance” according to the Washington Post), and sweats.
I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he does to make you feel like part of a reality show is to give you a little bit every night,” said Brent Montgomery, chief executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, in regards to the changing cast and the daily twists and turns.
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're going to fall behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny on the north coast of Kauai, 80 degrees, but he had shut himself down at home to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn’t get away from the TV, especially when Brett Kavanaugh had to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court depended on it.
"I remember when we used to do all those crazy shows and people would say, 'This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Investments are flowing into the most contested race in the early elections for a seat in Congress
Unsurprisingly, the 17th District of Pennsylvania is receiving a stream of money, thanks to the reshuffle of the congressional districts and hence two holders for the same place.
The newly-reassigned district in the suburbs of Pittsburgh points to conservative Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat from another district in a partial election last spring.
Lamb faces another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th congressional district, which is significantly overtaking the new 17th congressional district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th arrondissement sparked a financial dispute between the main funding institutions of the parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Commission (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Commission (NRCC).
Lamb rose to prominence in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the widely-discussed March partial election for Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district.
The position was held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts believe that the Democrats have a slight advantage.
U.S. considers imposing sanctions on El Salvador over its support for China, then withdraws
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” Department spokesman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
But sanctions were envisaged only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about 140 million US dollars in aid from America for the fight against drugs, for development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be excruciating for the Central American country with its unemployment and murder rate.
As domestic meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic well-being that served as a follow-up to a similar gathering last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent an influx of migrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior government officials said they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has now announced that he will attend the conference, scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, diplomats said.
All three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new strict messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to remain anonymous, who agreed to participate in the internal discussions.
Their accounts were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also asked to remain anonymous.
History of the study
The next move could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, which is currently a significant piece of evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also said to be directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump conspired with Russia during his campaign in their attack on our election.
If the congressional leadership changes, Mr. Trump will have to report to that body just as he prepares to stand up to voters, as well as perhaps to jurors made up of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I do not suggest that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable – nor that of his peers in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make these choices that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d’état against Hitler, as long as the West stood up to him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of massacres.
The course of history depends on such pivotal moments, and the inexorable march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
At present, Americans are facing several similar nodal moments.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since the newspaper reported that last year he offered to secretly record the president and speculated that he was not fit for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein said the story in The Times was inaccurate.
“How would we react if the new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh, requested by the FBI, is not complete or fair – or if it is approved by the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And above all, will we vote in the congressional elections if it forces Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I believe that we will not fail, because I learned a lesson from Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who had been taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light the Sabbath candles at that table wearing a swastika.
With a legacy like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic about the clash with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month would give them a significant chance to move forward from Group D of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorance from playing his first match of the season before the 2–2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that for the Rangers this result could become a springboard to greater achievements.
“We won an important point because Villarreal are a good opponent,” the 31-year-old said.
“We came into the game with the hope that we could win something and we left with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the game, but overall the draw looks like a fair result.
They were better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
We are looking forward to Thursday, another big night of our matches in Europe.
I hope that we will be able to fight for the three points, it will be a difficult match, because they achieved a good result in the last meeting, but I am sure that with the support of our audience we can do our best and achieve a good result.
“Last year was definitely difficult after everything that happened with my injuries and changes at the club, but now things seem to have gone in the right direction.
The team is good and the guys are really having fun, the training is beneficial.
I hope that we will be able to use all our strength to forget last season and achieve the desired success.”
Women are worried about their retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of what care they wanted to receive, few people discussed this with family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study said they had discussed with their husbands the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent spoke to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they haven’t taken the steps to have this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care for you if you don’t state your wishes in advance.
Together with your advisor and your family, discuss where and how you want to receive care, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you with an idea of how to pay for these expenses.
Your decisions when choosing a financial institution for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed-life insurance policy with monetary value to help you cover these costs, or self-insurance with your funds – if you have the cash resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with legal battles right from the start.
Appoint a health care proxy so that you have a designated trustee to oversee the medical care you receive and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the idea of an attorney for financial matters.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and travels to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Put these details in writing so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just about the financial aspect, it’s also about who the doctors will be,” Martin said.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make a plan."

His injuries are not life-threatening and the police are trying to get witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to the interruption of communications, support organizations are unable to obtain information from the Dongala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in Palu since the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala, which are located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow beach on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a regency that extends more than 300 km (180 mi) along the coastline of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, which is an administrative region smaller than a province, has an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the foundations of the economy of central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important for the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Recovery Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic “Pacific Ring of Fire” and is regularly mowed down by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on 26 December on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the entire Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck the most populous island in Indonesia, Java, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake strikes near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 struck one of the islands of Mentawai and triggered a 10-meter tsunami wave that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidi Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people remembered the devastation from the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong tremors hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Trak Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in a domestic violence alert, and resisting arrest, according to an Alaska State Police report released on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin was detained in the Mat-Su pre-trial detention facility and under an unsecured $500 bail, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded “innocent, certainly” when asked to plead, the media reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and pay a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which is punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin has faced criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, meddling in reporting a domestic violence crime, and possession of a weapon under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend says he punched her in the face.
Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 when she linked her son’s aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress stemming from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication networks have been cut off and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta.
On social networks, videos are spinning that show the moment of the collision.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspect in New York terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people — a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out the October attack on a bicycle lane near the West Side highway in lower Manhattan, trampling pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent in connection with the death penalty request filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, both charges could end in the death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, an expanded federal judicial panel filed a 22-count indictment against Saipov, including eight counts of racketeering-related murder typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “serious planning and intent,” prosecutors said, describing Saipov’s conduct as “horrible, cruel and perverse.”
“Saifulo Habibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Lori Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Erly, Hernan Felucci and Alejandro Damian Panuco,” the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last sought the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was subsequently sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was carried out in New York was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple, were executed after being convicted of conspiring and carrying out espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an Uzbek national, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22-count indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "apparently disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“In our view, the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty verdict and life imprisonment without the possibility of early release will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events for all affected,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defence team had previously asked the prosecutor’s office not to seek a death sentence.
Conservative MP Says Nigel Farage Should Lead Brexit Talks
Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the army of the people” today, during a protest at the Conservative Conference.
The former leader of Britain’s Independence Party said politicians should “feel the pressure” – as one of Theresa May’s own party members suggested he lead talks with the EU.
Peter Bon, a Conservative MP, said in March in Birmingham that Britain “would have left by now” if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But Mrs May’s challenge to reconcile with the party’s deeply divided ranks was highlighted by Remain-supporting Conservatives, who joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain his Chequers compromise plan despite attacks from Brexit supporters, Remain supporters and the EU.
The allies insist that she will make progress in trying to reach a deal with Brussels despite the hostile reactions and insist that Eurosceptics and Labour choose between her package and “chaos”.
Mr. Bon told protesters with the slogan "Getting out means getting out" in Solihull that he wanted to "throw away the Chequers".
He pointed out that Mr Farage should have participated on an equal footing with the others and that he should have been given the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we would have left by now,” he said.
The MP from Wellington added: “I support Brexit, but we have to abandon the Chequers plan.
Speaking about his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bon rejected claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The perception that the British have changed their mind and want to stay is completely false.”
Conservative spokeswoman Andrea Jenkins also took part in the rally, telling reporters: “I’m just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him, he is not popular in our party and our activists who actually took to the streets and really helped us get elected.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening."
In an open message to Mrs May, she added: “Prime Ministers retain their position when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians should “feel the pressure” if they plan to reverse the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
“It’s about the trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to change Brexit and we are gathered here today to say, ‘We will not let you get away with this.’
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country who helped us win Brexit, and we will never stop until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the stay marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists had raised flags reading “Conservatives against Brexit” after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the party's security concerns when he opened up at the conference.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can deploy the IT systems and all of Canada’s technology and more, and more, to cross borders unhindered, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren said he would “consider seriously” his candidacy for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "consider seriously the possibility of running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a city council meeting in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a staunch critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Representative Jeff Deal, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She is at the center of speculation that she could take over the Trump presidency in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the city hall since Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes women at the top.”
Arrested for Simms' death by LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in Friday's shooting when basketball player Wade Simms of the LSU was killed.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, a 20-year-old, during a press conference at 11 a.m.
They posted a video of Friday’s shooting and asked for help identifying the man seen in the footage.
Simms, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University area early Friday morning.
“Wade Simms was shot in the head, which ultimately led to his death,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being at the crime scene, had a gun, and shot Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and detained in the custody of the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
A 6<0xE2><0x80><0xB2>6<0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2>-sized youth from Baton Rouge, Simms played 32 games with 10 appearances as the title player last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 fights per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after the team’s instructions helped him beat Sebastian Vettel
From the moment that Valtteri Bottas ranked ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the instructions from the Mercedes team will play an important role in the race.
Bottas made a good start from the first position and seriously worried Hamilton, while defending his position in the first two corners, which allowed Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel was the first to make a pit stop and let Hamilton handle the traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be decisive for the outcome of the race.
The Mercedes also made a pit stop on the next lap and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton managed to overtake him after a daring maneuver and “rubber-to-rubber” driving, which forced the Ferrari driver to reluctantly release the inside of the track in order to avoid punishment with added time, having already closed the path of his opponent to a dangerous double manoeuvre.
On top of his 21st birthday Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and was seventh after the end of the first lap.
He even led the race for quite a long time, as he had decided to change his tyres later than the others, which would have allowed him to be faster at the end of the race and possibly overtake Kimi Raikkonen in the battle for fourth position.
He finally entered the pit stop in the 44th lap, but failed to catch up enough in the next eight laps and eventually Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a tough day as Valtteri did a great job all weekend and proved to be a real gentleman when he let me get ahead of him.
The team did an outstanding job to win the first two places on the podium,” Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her claim that she did not distribute a letter from Christine Blaise Ford accusing Supreme Court challenger Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented on how what was happening in the Senate showed that people were “evil and disgusting and insincere.”
“What can happen and the good that has happened in the last few days in the Senate when you see anger, when you see angry people and evil people and disgusting people and insincere people,” he said.
“When you look at publications and distribution, and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
You know what?
Diane Feinstein, have you spread?
Do you remember her answer... Did you release the document – “Oh, um, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't spread it."
Well, wait a minute.
Whether we have spread ... No, we have not spread,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent the letter detailing Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was circulated earlier in September – but Feinstein denies the distribution came from her office.
“I have not covered up Ford’s allegations, I have not disseminated her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it private, and I kept it as private as she wanted.”
But her denial was not well received by the president, who commented during Saturday night’s rally: “I’ll tell you, it was a very bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend a Supreme Court contender accused of sexual crimes against three women, the president pointed out that Democrats are using the allegations for their own ends.
“They are determined to regain power by all means possible.
Look at the shamelessness, the shamelessness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over in order to regain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars returned for Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants, winning the rematch in Dundee 5-3 on Saturday.
Giants took the lead early in the game with two goals after hitting Patrick Dwyer and Frances Beauvilliers.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney tied for the hosts before Dwyer regained the Giants lead.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard equalized for Dundee, before the two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen to consolidate their victory.
This is the third victory in the Elite League for Adam Keef's boys, who escaped from the bottom to defeat Dundee in Belfast with 2-1 Friday night.
This was the fourth clash between opponents this season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
The blow with which Dwyer discovered the result came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with Kendall McFaul's assistance, and then David Rutherford doubled the advance by assisting Beauvilier four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped the draw with the help of Kauni at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead before the first break, scoring a second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bushar again equalized the chances with a powerful shot in the door at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen to give Dundee a lead for the first time this match at the end of the second half, as he gave his best and solidified the team's victory with the fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
The Giants, who lost the last four games out of a total of five games, are hosting Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
A flight manager was killed to make sure hundreds of people on board the plane could escape an earthquake.
A flight manager in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero after he died, ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board was able to take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing in a powerful earthquake that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami wave.
Strong aftershocks continued to hit the area, and many were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues were on the run to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the highly shaking control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri Airport.
He stayed in place to make sure Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would be able to take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he decided he was going to crash.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesia’s air traffic control spokesman, Johannes Sirith, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts were broken when we heard about this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands after the country's disaster response agency said access to the cities of Dongala, Sighi and Butong was restricted.
"We anticipate that the number of deaths will increase as many bodies are still under the rubble and many people cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching six meters devastated Palu, where a mass funeral took place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings in more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.
There's looting everywhere in the minimarkets."
Ian Gelfand, chairman of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is fighting to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s military: “I ask you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini plane crash in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini has reported that one person is missing after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline, which flew a plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean, now reports that one person has been reported missing after it said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a press release, Air Niugini said that as of Saturday afternoon they could not contact one male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Boats of local people helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, authorities said seven people had been admitted to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, all of them in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon shortly before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had passed the runway.
American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, claims that the plane went very low.
"That's very nice," says Janes.
Janes says that he and the others managed to run through the water deep to the waist to get to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy says sailors repairing a nearby marina also helped with the rescue by using an inflatable boat to ferry people to shore before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Safety Network data shows that 111 people have died on PNG-registered flights over the past two decades, but Air Niugini was not involved in any case.
Analyst exposes the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors closed their case this Saturday in a retrial against a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlett of the US Department of Justice testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contrary to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the records showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to interrogate Sanford.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said "it's a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy is that Tellis said she had known Chambers for two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records show they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her text messages, phone calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its defense on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be presented to the jurors later that day.

Artists such as The Fugees and Common were reborn in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
New York City Babysitter Sues Couple After Being Fired for ‘Racist’ Message
A New York City nanny is suing a couple for being fired for discrimination after receiving a wrongly sent message from her mother complaining that she was “just another black woman.”
The couple denies being racist, describing the claim as “blackmail”.
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was stunned to learn that her new babysitter, Gisele Morris, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, and twice.
After realizing her mistake, the “uncomfortable” Ms. Plasko-Flaxman fired Ms. Morris, saying that the previous nanny, who was African-American, had not done her job well and that she was expecting a Filipino woman.
Mrs. Morris was paid for a day's work, then sent home by taxi.
Morris is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal, claiming the amount of $350 a day for the six-month arrangement she was originally hired for, even though she did not have a contract.
“I want to show them, look, you shouldn’t do that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “You’re sure this is discrimination.”
In response to the lawsuit, the couple claimed they were not racist, adding that the termination of Morris’s employment was a reasonable action, as they feared that they would not be able to trust her after they insulted her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have offended, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Think about it.”
Likening the claim to “extortion,” Plasco said his wife had given birth only two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to attack someone in this condition?
That’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
While the court case is still under consideration, public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social networks, condemning them for their behavior and their logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers wouldn’t feel a connection to a talking bear, new letter reveals
Bond’s daughter, Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted by the public, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it’s published.
It’s a lot of fun now that we’re aware of Paddington’s tremendous success.”
She said her father, who worked as a cinematographer for the BBC before being inspired to write the children’s book about a small bear toy, would have felt optimistic about a possible rejection of the book, adding that he was celebrating the 60th anniversary of the book’s publication “with mixed feelings” after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she described as an “important member of our family,” she added that her father secretly felt proud of the ultimate success.
“He was a very humble man, and he wasn’t boastful,” she said.
But because Paddington felt so real, it’s like having a child who has achieved something: you’re proud of him, even though it’s not really your doing.
I think he sort of took Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always credited Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors struggled in vain to save her life.
“Nad was constantly calling to say that the situation was really bad, that he did not expect to survive,” said Mrs. Eden-Laperuz.
“Then Nad called me to tell me that she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said to her, “Tashi, baby, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
Medications given to her by doctors to support her heart slowly stop working and leave her system.
She was gone for a while before that, and that's how it ended.
I just had to sit there and wait, realising that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to pull myself together."
Finally, Mrs. Eden-Laperouse, who still mourns the loss of her daughter, boards the plane along with the other passengers who have no idea of the ordeal she is going through.
“No one understood,” she said.
“I was bowing my head and my tears were dripping all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt this overwhelming sense of empathy for Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Previous PostPrevious Grieving Women Place Cards To Prevent Suicides From Bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide attempt to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put on a bridge in Wales cards with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lidney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
It has always been said that his smile lights up every room.”
However, he gave up his job before leaving and found himself in a “really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Ms Davis said: “I am constantly worried that this will have any consequences.”
Ms. Davis created the cards “to let people know that there’s someone to go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her companion in life for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed or anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He got to the bottom of Christmas – when the kids opened their presents, he didn’t look at them or anything.”
She said that this was a terrible trauma for them, but they had to cope: “This opens a gap in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to move forward and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in doubt after the FBI opens an investigation
I wondered if we could really achieve what he wanted – a limited-duration and limited-scope investigation – maybe we could pool our efforts,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “falling apart” despite a hardened supra-party blockage.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
It’s because of the moment itself.
The snap election is just five weeks away, on Nov. 6 — if Republicans are not performing well as expected, their attempts to elect their representative to the nation’s highest court will be seriously hurt.
George W. Bush calls senators, inviting them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works for Mr. Bush at the White House, and with his help met his wife, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to declare equality and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
North Korea's refugee numbers 'decrease' under Kim
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-sug, citing data from South Korea’s Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 refugees last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the higher amounts demanded by human traffickers, were key factors.
There is no official comment from Pyongyang.
The majority of North Korean refugees eventually become South Korean citizens.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which separates the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants rather than refugees, often forcibly repatriating them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
This happened after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed to basically work for the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of trust in the United States, we will not be confident in our national security, and in these circumstances there is no way to disarm unilaterally first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was too unbalanced to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had reacted this way, they would have called her ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blaze Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times he almost cried and became emotional when discussing his family and school years.
He also strongly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a “grotesque and coordinated attack on the individual” orchestrated by liberals who are displeased that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he was unable to serve on the Supreme Court because it was clear he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with these allegations and with the way he's going after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi denied it when asked if she would try to discredit Cavano if he was appointed and if Democrats gained a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll put it this way: If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s unfit not only to go to the Supreme Court, but to the court he’s in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s potential rulings on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he was seen as a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reject certain Supreme Court decisions.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't it wonderful?'"
Women need to be controlled too.
It's a well-founded criticism, after months and years of dispersal of rage, and she can't accept it without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Steinham told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do you?”
She continued, “I received tremendous help from a woman who was an executive somewhere, who shared that she also cries when she gets angry, but has developed her own technique, thanks to which when she gets angry and cries, she tells her interlocutor, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then it just goes on.
I thought it was genius.”
Tears are allowed when expressing anger, in part because they are misunderstood at first.
One of my clearest memories of a previous job, in an office mostly with men, was how once, as I was sobbing in inexpressible rage, an older woman grabbed me by the neck—a chilling handler I’d always been a little afraid of—and she dragged me to the stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they did it to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught out of wedlock on a yacht called the Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me 30 years later, laughing.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted was for another one to show up.
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because she was late in the campaign, she fell behind in raising funds and decided that she would not stay in the race if she failed to raise $2 million.
The battle is doomed to failure.
She realizes that some of her supporters, who give $1,000 to men, would only give $250 to her.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount?” she wondered.
During her speech, in which she stated that she would not continue with the official campaign, she was flooded with so many feelings – gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system, which makes it so difficult to raise money and be able to address the voters, not the delegates, as well as anger against sexism, that she became emotional.
“You might think I had a nervous breakdown,” remembers Ms. Schroeder how the media reacted.
“Someone might think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my tombstone?
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China trade war could serve Beijing
The first shots in the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle is only gaining momentum, a rift between the two countries will benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired the first warning salvo this year, taxing key elements of China’s exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation of tensions came this week with new tariffs affecting US$200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) of output with effective taxation on half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Each time, Beijing retaliated with retaliatory new tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has vowed to retaliate against any U.S. strike, and soon the world’s second-largest economy is not expected to ignore that.
To force Washington to give up is to give in to demands, but to lower his head publicly before Washington would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, according to experts, if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure from the trade war with the United States could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a hasty political solution in both Washington and Beijing could create the conditions for an economic crisis in either country is actually more dangerous than observers have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, Asia-related research fellow at the Center for a New American Security expert group.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria has said it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding a country ravaged by more than seven years of war.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress we have made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas ravaged by terrorists in order to return them to their normal state.
Now there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living there are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muallem said the Syrian regime would welcome any help in rebuilding the devastated state.
But he stressed that conditional aid or aid from countries that funded the rebels would not be accepted.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the U.S. team 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has suffered six consecutive losses on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the championship crown in the tournament after the team, led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, reached the required 14.5 points, which guaranteed victory over the United States.
The US star, Phil Michelson, who performed poorly for most of the tournament, threw his first shot at the 16th hole (with a "pair" 3) in the water, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all rounds, becoming one of four players in the tournament's history to reach a 5-0-0 balance since the race was held in its current format after 1979.
American Jordan Spite lost categorically with 5 & 4 from the player in the team of Europe, located at the lowest place in the rankings – Torbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olessen from Denmark.
World leader Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, for whom this is probably the last appearance at the Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cup appearances, became the European with the most points earned in the tournament ever, this year increasing his asset to 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can pick up the bowl again.
In everything, the team is the most important and I am happy that I was able to help,” said the excited Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He handed over the baton to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods with 2&1 on the singles on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching him play,” Ram said.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and his overall Ryder Cup balance is now 13-21-3.
Strange statistics about one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles – an indicator by which he is second only to Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high-class golf on all days of the tournament.
Team USA captain Jim Furik said after the team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
At one point this morning, we put pressure on the European team.
There was a fight.
I'm taking off Thomas' hat.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players performed very well.
We will regroup, we will discuss important issues with the U.S. Professional Golfers Association and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will look only forward.
I love these 12 boys and am proud to be their captain.
You can't help but take off your opponent's hat.
We were just overplayed."
