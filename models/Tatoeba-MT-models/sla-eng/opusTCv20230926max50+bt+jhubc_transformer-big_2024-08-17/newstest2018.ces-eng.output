Civil Rights Movement issues travel alert for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has issued a warning to people of color traveling to Missouri on the basis of discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
The NAACP Travel Recommendation for the State of Missouri, effective August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors, and residents of Missouri to pay increased attention when traveling across the state as a result of a series of contentious racially motivated incidents currently occurring throughout the state.
The NAACP said the move was based on Missouri’s current laws, which make it difficult to defend racist-motivated acts in court, as well as the actions of law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities.
“Civil rights are being violated.
People are stopped by police just because of the color of their skin, attacked or killed,” Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP, told the Kansas City Star.
"We have the largest number of complaints to date."
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization for the U.S. state.
Among the incidents cited by the organization were racially motivated abuse directed at black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in contentious circumstances earlier this year after running out of gas while traveling across the state and was thrown into custody by police without charge of a crime.
The travel recommendation also draws attention to a recent statement by the Missouri Attorney General’s Office that black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped by police.
“The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what could happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared - they should bring money with them for a possible bail payment or alert their relatives that they are going to travel across the state."
According to the FBI’s current hate crime reporting program, there were 100 hate crimes reported in Missouri in 2015, putting the state in 16th place among all states.
The travel alert is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult to sue a company for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after states passed an immigration law that allows state officials to detain people for violating the law, which the ACLU says aims to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the Foreign Office, but recently advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the U.S.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family is not at peace even after 12 years!
The victim was Sally Anne Bowman.
A Croydon-born girl was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie in the restaurant where she worked, who stabbed her.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana together, and then he killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe and watched the meticulous forensic work of searching the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years in prison for the murder and rape of model Sally.
He only admitted to assaulting a minor in court, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found the girl lying dead on the street.
Three years later, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson were arguing on the fateful night.
The killer said, "He was really angry, and after his attack, the girl started screaming."
"It even attracted the attention of taxi drivers," he said falsely.
The girl, according to his testimony, was supposed to defend herself, as she could, but in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stab her in the street.
Dixie's version was proven to be a lie, and she accused him.
After Dixie confessed, he talked about his horniness and lust for the girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to smoke marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally, he was at his ex-girlfriend's house, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, Dexie himself told the police.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth.”
And after twelve years, the family faces further attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
He's been injured four times in the last six months.
There are cruel people out there who dig these graves.
"So our daughter isn't there anymore," Linda, the mother of the deceased girl, told The Mirror about the disappearance of the ashes urn.
Linda waited for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"Czechs are neither prudish nor conservative," says Martin Rá<0xC5><0xBE>, who runs the Prague-based Intimacy boutique.
In it you will find designer and luxurious erotic aids.
Including those from Czech designer Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ová.
It started quietly, about 12 years ago.
Martin Rá<0xC5><0xBE> and his friends went on a cycling trip around Moravia.
One of them brought not only a bicycle, but also a box full of unusual-looking vibrators.
“There were all kinds of moles and dolphins and it was all green and yellow and just totally different,” he tells me over lunch.
His friend and another companion decided to work with the German manufacturer of design erotic devices Fun Factory, which caught Martin’s eye, so he offered to help with marketing.
When the partner left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, he runs the Intimacy boutique in Benediktská Street in Prague, where he sells erotic accessories in the way luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
Why wouldn't I?
These are also design items.
Wait, wait, this is what you're talking about at lunch, you think?
Come on, don't be such puritans!
The Berlin Fun Factory, designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, served as an inspiration for the Intimacy boutique.
It was opened in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic trade than what everyone here is used to.
No covered shop windows, all done in a beautiful, discreet style, products exhibited more like in perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k <0xC5><0xA0>ebelka began to consider how to handle the Prague store, where it should be and what its name should be.
The name Intimacy appealed to both of them.
"It has to do with intimacy, and it's also, you could say, gentle," he says.
This was followed by the purchase of an Internet domain and the search for a suitable space, which went in parallel with various visualizations of the interior.
In the end, the variant won, which spread the store into a garden of delight and a bedroom dominated by a bed.
It was prepared by Dagmar <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánová from FormaFatal studio.
We found the space in 2013.
At first, it didn't seem ideal because it wasn't on the main street, but because of that, it sat next to the name of Intimacy.
It's intimate.
It is in an alley next to the main one, so no one is looking at customers,” Martin Rá<0xC5><0xBE> says.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to make a store that was different, with branded nice goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed of having entered into such a trade at all.
When I entered the Intimacy boutique half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Plus, I didn't even feel like going to the sex shop.
Right at the door I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion boutiques.
Even though there are only female attendants in the store, just so that women do not hesitate to ask for help, does not mean that a man’s leg does not visit here.
For the most part, gentlemen come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men usually don't know how to guess the right size, and they choose bigger ones," Martin smiles at the frequent mistake.
Those are the prejudices, the clichés, that women need some big help, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith might choose an unnecessarily large vibrator.
Similarly, men prefer mostly black underwear, while a woman tends to prefer the color pink.
The absolute bestseller at the moment is a product aptly called Satisfyer.
From the look on my face, it must be clear that I don’t know which one is beating, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's a non-contact clitoris stimulator.
There is an adolescent need in me to chuckle with admiration at the serious tone in which the interpretation is given to me.
It's like it doesn't fit.
And it doesn't really catch on.
It is at a good price and has a perfect user reference.
We didn't think he'd be so well received.
This is the latest revolutionary news.
The first revolution was caused by a vibrator in the shape of a seahorse.
He made sure that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The other was a We-Vibe steam vibrator.
He completely broke the taboo that some men may persist in, namely that they see competition in erotic aids.
“There are different options,” he continues.
With one motor, with two motors, with remote control.
This is a favorite category.
With a love connection, a woman can have a control in her hand and determine the intensity of the vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain downside is the category of feeder vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose devices and buy classic vibrators, although they may only use them externally.
However, in Western Europe, especially with younger customers, it is very popular.
What about men?
It’s hard to say whether a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
I guess it would have to be handled a little differently.
The question is what to offer men," Martin thinks.
"We also have tools for them, but to a limited extent." The most sold is primarily a masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It does not look like an anatomical imitation of the vagina, but "more like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
They focus a lot on functionality and the experience of use.
In Japan, it is completely different.
It makes me wonder.
I thought that Japanese women are very fond of erotic aids, I object.
“That’s the reality of the internet,” he said.
The mundane is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more associated with the fact that they are used by women.
In Japan, they are completely normal for men, and on the contrary, they are taboo for women." Just for the record - what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimacy boutique, sells worldwide, still accounts for about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
The Czechs and Czechs are not prudes.
On the contrary, we are quite a friendly nation.
Certainly unlike countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
The typical client of the store is between 35 and 50 years old and "has already had some experience with both sexual life and some aids.
Martin Rá<0xC5><0xBE> and his business partner, Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k <0xC5><0xA0>ebelka, make sure that each product is perfectly functional, so that she can return.
We also do not want to indulge in specialties such as bondage and latex, because on the one hand we do not have space for this, on the other hand it is absolutely not suitable here.
Such things might discourage the ones we're trying to target.
Which are people who have always had the shame of going to a sex shop because they were afraid that something like this would look at them.
A lot of the products displayed on the shelves are really pleasing.
This is also due to the selection of represented reputable brands.
Some of them even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first to be awarded was the aforementioned seahorse "and it triggered a change in the entire industry.
It began to abandon cheap materials and, on the contrary, to work with non-harmful ones, other designs, different colors...
It is pleasant that the Czech Republic is behind the design of some, namely the popular designer Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ová.
I have to say that I was quite pleasantly surprised how many people buy design items Whoop.de.doo from Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ová, although they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go straight for Venus balls from Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ová.
She did a really huge piece of work by presenting in the Czech Republic and abroad exactly what we are trying to present - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story began as a schoolwork.
Now it is a finished product, which is also produced in our country.
I wanted to keep the production process under control and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Since this is not a large production, but a small series, it is certainly more expensive than a large series.
Maybe I am going a bit against the current, but I think it is important to maintain the development in the Czech Republic.
It could easily happen that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything,” Anna later describes the situation, who agrees with Martin that our company is becoming more and more open.
There is no negative or negative attitude.
Most people are said to be embarrassed.
Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ová currently has a vibrator on offer, to which you can have a personal message prepared, and this year she is also planning her own lubricant gel.
In the next year, vibrational eggs and other novelties should be added.
The Limits of Healthy Sex
I wonder where the boundaries of what's right lie.
Is there anything Martin Rá<0xC5><0xBE> would not sell anymore?
It's awfully hard to define.
What may seem normal to one person, may seem completely abnormal to another, so we define ourselves more as a range of branded manufacturers.
None of them go to extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: What was the craziest demand they received?
Just this week came an e-mail in which a lady asked for a masturbation aid for her twenty-eight-centimeter-long boyfriend.
So we had to write to her that, unfortunately, we don't have anything like that.
There’s still the question of whether any of us were joking,” Martin takes a suspicious look at me.
It also happens from time to time...
A blow to Karl Gott.
After two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Karel <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>d<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xBD> is struggling with a serious illness.
Karl Gott's best friend fights a disease that steals people's memories.
"Yes, I'm afraid that's true," the singer himself confirmed to Blesk.
I am aware of my illness and can handle it quite well under the circumstances.
"I am taking medication to slow down the symptoms of the disease," he added, thanking loved ones for their support.
The whole extended family came together to make Karl's life easier.
Wife Eva is trying to be at home as much as possible, and her daughters from the first marriage Zuzana and Tereza are coming to the house on B<0xC3><0xAD>lá Hora to see their father.
St<0xC5><0x99>ed<0xC3><0xBD> fought cancer twice and passed on his experience to Slav<0xC3><0xAD>k to support him in his demanding treatment.
He has had 60 chemotherapy treatments.
He was able to return to work and to the tennis court and to the ski slopes.
"I am told by the astrologer that I will be here by the age of ninety," said Karel Blesku.
He's a fighter.
He still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words to myself so I don't forget them," said Charles.
The actress Kv<0xC4><0x9B>ta Fialová is already fighting the same disease in the institute.
Do you have an Alzheimer's patient in your family?

The Chilean parliament has lifted the ban on abortions, the law will assess the <0xC3><0x9A>S.
In Chile, there is still an absolute ban on abortion, so it must not be carried out for health reasons.
“I’m sorry that the legislators have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will be deciding what we have been arguing about in parliament for more than two years,” Socialist Senator Isabel Allende complained.
Chile’s constitutional court has 10 members and is due to have a new president in late August who is close to the opposition, according to AFP.
A bill to repeal the absolute ban on abortion, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was passed by the Senate on July 19.
The right-wing opposition then announced that the law would be challenged in court because it violated the unborn child’s right to life.
MPs postponed a vote on the bill last month until it was examined by a joint parliamentary committee.
On Wednesday, MPs approved the proposal and the Senate did so again after them.
Under the new legislation, abortion should cease to be a criminal offence in three cases: if a woman’s life is at risk, if the fetus has no hope of survival, or if the pregnancy resulted from rape.
Similar exceptions have existed in Chile since 1931, before women were granted the right to vote in 1949, according to the Spanish newspaper El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s.
The absolute ban on abortion in 1989 was imposed by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just months before he left office.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world that has an absolute ban on abortion.
Others are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, about 20 women are now behind bars, serving up to 30 years in prison for interrupting a pregnancy.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, it was a spontaneous abortion, which the court described as murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
Trump's White House now targets Statue of Liberty
A clear sign of regime change is the criticism of statues.
Americans could talk about it as well as anyone else – see the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein’s statue in Baghdad’s Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was getting into when, in a passionate debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta about the president’s proposals to drastically limit legal immigrants, he set out with a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty.
It should be added that Miller did not attack the statue as such.
For this, he would be lynched by a crowd of cruise ship owners and imitators of the Statue of Liberty.
However, he attacked its importance, namely the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous poem Emma Lazarus was placed on the pedestal, only 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller rebuked Acosta, saying, “I don’t want to go down in history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the world.
The poem that was placed on the pedestal, and to which you refer, is not part of it."
Miller is actually right, but as he said himself, this is not about history.
These are, above all, the startling words of Emma Lazarus, which resonate today - inviting not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Let there come to me, who has fallen, who is poor, who can hardly breathe freely, who is a miserable worm in the midst of crowded cities."
And it is in modern times that we can better than ever watch these “poor worms” on our screens.
Miller did not try to criticize poetry - he wanted to clarify that these people are not welcome in the US.
This conflict about the meaning of the statue is part of a vast political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the meaning of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who after her death sought to plant a plaque with a poem on the pedestal of the statue, knew quite well that she was embarking on a high political game.
The statue was meant to express the union of the French and American republican governments by representing a classic theme, that is, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is not abstract, but has her own voice.
It also has a very different name: Mother of Exiles.
Combining poetry with the idea of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of a statue, right-wingers have long sought to reverse that meaning.
The well-known commentator Rush Limbaugh - John the Baptist on Trump's rise to power - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not actually invite anyone into the country, but represents early neo-constructivism, bringing the American flame to the backward world: "The Statue of Liberty is advancing.
It brings the torch of freedom out of the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch is not meant to light the way to the United States."
Curiously, Limbaugh stumbles upon an important point.
The meaning of the statue depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the point of view of an exhausted and damned traveler who, often after a long and terrifying voyage across the ocean, arrives with hope in his heart in a new land.
It is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And this is, of course, a perspective that neither Miller nor Trump will definitely recognize.
Their torch is not to light the way, but to inflame the hatred that is their only source of power.
2017 World Championships in Athletics: Neil Black sings praises to the Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when the British team had only two Scottish members
Neil Black, director of the U.K. athletics federation, said a strong squad of 16 Scots on the World Cup team would be a "huge benefit to the team".
For the 2017 World Championships in London, which starts on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes have been selected.
Black believes that “something strange is happening” in Scotland, and British athletics could learn a lot from the Scots.
“We’re trying to understand and adapt — we’re going to work on that,” Black said.
“I’ve talked to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has something to do with what they did.
Scottish athletics officials think it has something to do with what they did.
British athletics: It has to do with what they did.
The people on the streets think so too.
Whatever it is, it’s absolutely amazing.”
Several Scottish athletes will be seeking medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m race, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain.
"Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing," Black said.
“Several athletes, whether Scots or non-Scottish, came out of the room with a great sense of pride and motivation.
The passion and undisguised feelings with which Eilidh spoke were unrepeatable.”
The silver medalist of the Commonwealth, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, said it was “incredible” that there were 16 Scottish athletes on the British team.
The previous record for 1983 and 2015 was seven.
The cross-country skier has set five British and two European records in the past year alone.
At the World Championships he will participate in the 1500 m and 5000 m races.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who will run the 1500 m track. This season he won the British Team Races and the Annual Games.
Doyle recalls her first championship, where she was the only other Scottish member of the team, Lee McConnell.
The team captain said she was "very proud" of the fact that not only were a large number of her teammates on the team, but in many cases, they would also attack the finals and the medal.
“The extraordinary thing about being captain of the team is that I was chosen by the other members of the team. It was a great honor for me, but knowing that I was chosen by the team members is a pleasure,” she added.
“Obviously, I’m very proud of all the Scots who made the team.
It proves where we've gone.
They are athletes who will think of the front seats on the podium.
And my opening statement?
Yes, I think it worked.
I just pointed out the fact that we can be proud of this year’s championship, because it is held on home soil.
It is important to take advantage of the support of our home fans and to be happy that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance at the race and I’m going to enjoy the incredible atmosphere.”
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don’t run for public office if you can’t stand criticism from voters
The father of our country knew about his criticism.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for newspapers to criticize him for everything from domestic politics to his political views.
This criticism did not leave him cold.
But he didn't try to silence the critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away from us - and the stupid and dumb will be led like sheep to the slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland's Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work hard to start acting like Washington.
Hogan’s staff blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who freely expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
He was sued this week by the American Civil Liberties Union.
The governor’s staff dismissed the lawsuit as unfounded, and there were many “who cares” comments on the internet.
“It’s just Facebook,” many users said.
Still, it matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, he is a hugely popular Republican governor.
It boasts the second-highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not a pushover.
As can be seen, he governs his state with self-confidence and strictly observes the principles.
He has also proven to be adept at using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his constituents — with the exception of not publishing the first bare-headed photo after undergoing chemotherapy.
Blocking people who visit the governor’s site – which is a public forum, designated as official and managed by his staff paid for by taxpayers’ money – is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor, saying that the blocking of comments came from the position of moderating posts.
However, using the image of internet trolls, spammers or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed several real people who had their posts deleted.
And that's exactly what they are - real people speaking to their elected leaders; teacher, businessman and pastor, no trolls.
As everyone said, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his commentary, appealing to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi’s attorney Sarma Ramani, Md., asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hate speech.
“I have politely noted that I am disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other current news reports,” she wrote in a commentary section of the Washington Post.
“I don’t like the idea that when a certain number of people comment on the same topic, some people are labeled as promoting a so-called collective effort, rather than being recognized as a larger group of interested citizens.”
What the governor’s staff called “concentrated spam interest” would likely be called “defence” by others.
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would require sending employees to the streets, where they would collect and burn all copies with criticism or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that’s exactly what’s happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public figure to be criticized for defaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing a lawsuit from Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
Loudoun County Board of Supervisors chairman James C. Cachers says she violated the first amendment in Alexandria, where she blocked a voter from accessing her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
In Washington’s day, the low cost of shipping had virtually the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled, and his position as leader was questioned by many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to newspapers and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical documents gathered by people in the online Papers of George Washington Project, petitions were amassing in his office criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation agreement with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and intimidation lie at the very foundation of our nation.
And a true leader has to accept that.
Czechs quickly used free roaming, abroad they consume more data than at home.
Czechs consume more of their tariff abroad than at home.
Most often they move in Austria, but data consumption in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On vacation, they have more time to browse the web, and under the umbrella, they usually do not have the opportunity to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, swimming and smart phone in hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of local operators at domestic prices.
This is according to the latest O2 statistics.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travelers abroad have more data available within the flat rate than at home.
It is therefore no wonder that in Croatia, where a minimum of our fellow countrymen travel during the winter, data consumption has increased even fifty-fold this summer season.
In second place in the list of consumed data was Italy.
Most minutes Czechs call from Germany, where many of them go to work and during the summer.
According to the data of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, Croatia is visited by 800,000 Czechs a year, making it our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here exchanged the book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
This year’s record was July 7.
"The transferred data would fit tens of millions of photos," Silvia Cieslarová, director of the mobile segment at O2, said in a statement.
Although Croatia leads in data volume, the highest number of Czech users is in neighboring countries.
Austria comes first, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy is sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and active holidays, for which we do not have so much time to browse the Internet.
"Moreover, the Czechs are heading for the Adriatic," Cieslarová explained.
While for data, the operator recorded high year-on-year growth after the release of roaming charges, for telephony, the growth is much lower.
The number of minutes spent roaming has doubled compared to last year.
Germany dominates here with a huge lead over other countries.
"Roaming calls are more often used by corporate customers on business trips," Cieslarová added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for a homely atmosphere at Renaissance Club
Former golfer Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for a relaxed atmosphere at the Renaissance Club in East Lothian, Scotland, which hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open, over the next three days.
Ronan Rafferty, who hails from Northern Ireland, succumbed to Paul Eales on his way to the finals last year at the nearby Archerfield Links golf course. This year, he will play the role of tournament ambassador on behalf of the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I’ve watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow before my eyes and this year’s tournament will show the world its beauty,” Rafferty said.
“Players will be able to enjoy the first-class quality of the pitch.
Jerry did a great job.
He is a passionate advocate of this game and is proud of his achievements.
This year’s tournament is in the right hands.”
Englishman Eales will defend his title for the first time, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I feel good about it," said the Southport golfer.
“I had no opportunity to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because a year after my victory the tournament was cancelled.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful place to play golf.
I remember last year when Sharon and I were really lucky to win.
It was a wonderful time that I will never forget.”
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating his 50th birthday this year, is returning home.
This event will be his first participation since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play on home soil," Orr said of Helensburgh.
“You want to be successful and you feel a lot of pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I think I’m doing well.
I am satisfied with the result so far.”
The three players will be joined on the pitch by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players on the pitch; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission to the tournament is free. Parking is <0xC2><0xA3>5 for a car with one passenger and <0xC2><0xA3>10 for a car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia’s Gold Country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she does not use the stove.
In fact, he rarely uses a frying pan.
In her wooden hut, located in the capital Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the local language "note" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, remove the potato and taste it with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on muddy ground - the house is not equipped with furniture - where he also does his daily work, such as washing clothes in the muddy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room without a roof supplants the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any field to cultivate.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late into the night poses a danger: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol, and the village is also home to soldiers.
"In the afternoon, after five o'clock, no one dares to wander around the village," Bardina says.
It is a rare glimpse into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by public show of hands before the occupying army.
The current anti-Dutch protest movement quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - an independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and desolate city, where you can reach after a ninety-minute flight from the capital of the province of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a five-hour stomach-hugging ride.
Public transport does not work at this location.
The city of 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs made of woolen sheets in shades of gray and rusty.
Very few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners, looked at this place.
Before the arrival of Christians, the locals worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
“We weren’t used to wearing this dress,” says Bardina, pointing to his colorful, hand-knitted turban, dark T-shirt and radiant skirt.
"We used to only carry leaves."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of the population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy rates are among the worst in all of Asia.
It is also the gold of Indonesia.
The world’s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of Phoenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a rocky province roughly the size of New Jersey that is home to about 153,000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua supports an estimated $78 billion worth of logging.
However, these riches are a source of suffering for the Papuans and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
According to a 2005 New York Times investigation, Freeport paid about $20 million to local military officials and units between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 per officer.
Papuans calling for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely repressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
Mass killings in the Papuan tribal region during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, describes the atrocities that took place last year as extrajudicial executions, torture – according to another report, rape and electrocution are particularly popular – and the brutal repression of peaceful protesters.
“It’s difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The situation was aggravated by the fact that Papuan resources were attracting colonists to Indonesia.
Of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants, 83% profess Christianity, but the demographics are changing with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are struggling to survive.
“Immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans,” explains 24-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Paniai and moved to work in the provincial capital of Jayapura.
"The original inhabitants of Papua - mom-mom (women) - lost their jobs."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Jokowi, promised to tackle inequality and rights violations as part of his 2014 presidential campaign.
The former carpenter also secured his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta, 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua, and the local people feel betrayed.
“Our hearts were broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi in the hope that he would hear our call for justice,” You said.
The fact is that just two months after Jakowi's October inauguration, Paniai experienced a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were singing Christmas carols at a camp fire in the town of Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on motorbikes emerged from the gloom of the night.
Two of the surprised children told them to turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was touched by this reproach and the tone with which it was uttered, and later returned with four other soldiers, said the local priest Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in a drunken state chased a group of children and beat them with the butts of their weapons, victims and witnesses of the event said.
One of the soldiers then fired on a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a nearby election commission building, and the next day things escalated.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on a football pitch outside the local police station and army headquarters to demand justice.
They came with ceremonial hunting bows and performed a waita dance - in which one runs in a circle and imitates the singing of birds - of the Papuan tribe Mee Pago.
Several Protestants began to throw stones at the buildings.
With increasing tension, the soldiers were ordered over the radio: “If the crowd tries to resist at least three times, you are allowed to shoot,” according to an official document, the contents of which were never published in the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of Enarotali district, Kego Koto, recognized the danger and urged residents to disperse to their homes.
But no one paid attention to his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," he told TIME magazine on the porch of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame does not yet know who the shooter was, but he said the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people around and a lot of shooting," he added.
One of the locals, Alfius Youw, said his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, had been hit three times.
“I ran to the body to make sure it was really him,” Yohanes, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, told TIME in a sullen voice.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
The Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers were only “securing” the station under attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us with death,” a spokesman for the Papuan police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many escaped injuries.
The news of the killings made headlines in the Jakarta media the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapur, expressing his understanding for the families of the victims and promising to address the violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never be repeated," he said.
National Security Minister Wiranto announced in October 2016 that he would introduce an out-of-court mechanism to resolve acts of violence that have occurred in the past.
Almost immediately, however, the excuses began to come.
“Most of the violent acts took place a long time ago.
Some of them occurred in the 90s of the last century and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these violent acts, but it will not be an easy task,” he said.
However, in a June 5 interview with TIME, held in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he did not plan to introduce any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said, “all cases will be brought to court.”
Wiranto, who was indicted by the UN for “crimes against humanity” on the basis of more than 1,000 deaths during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the Paniai incident, had been settled so far.
The families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai welcomed his claims with distrust.
“I’ve been interviewed four times in the last three years, but so far I haven’t seen anything,” Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
A few years later, he says, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid I'll be arrested by the army or shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many Paniai residents who are afraid to speak out about the incident.
According to him, he was beaten by members of the army after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the army started looking for me," he said.
And the shooting hasn't stopped yet.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
The skirmish, in which one person died and another 17 were injured, took place between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to provide assistance in transporting an unconscious man to hospital.
Ravianus Douw, 24, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company building.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at the members and the response was a warning shot.
Locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
“There was a panic, we were afraid of retribution,” Domingo Badii, 29, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the injured, told TIME.
"I didn't leave the house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament demanded the punishment of the participating police officers and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the side of the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes living in the central highlands.
Many of them have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of rebels that protects the rights of Papuans by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian police officers.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the army has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of Paniai residents in recent years, all under the pretext of “ensuring national sovereignty.”
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known as a “tragic and forgotten place” among the people of Papua.
The fuel for the fire is poverty.
The little rice that is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
The bread is unreachable.
The locals grow their own food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruits and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each of them cultivates four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is intended for the needs of the family, the rest are sold in the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since the airport opened more air routes and new immigrants began to flow into the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants.
Fewer jobs are usually filled by more educated and wealthy immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital and education they need to start a business.
“Young people are moving out of villages because of a lack of jobs and money,” said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Thanks to the isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
Strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
Earlier this year, two French journalists, Franck Escudie and Basile Longchamp, were expelled from the papaya for “lack of cooperation with the authorities,” despite the fact that they were given such a rare film permit.
Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, promised Jokowi in his election campaign to abolish strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development.
“Foreign journalists working in the rebel-held easternmost regions of Papua and West Papua are at great risk: non-recognition of visas and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
The lack of news from foreign journalists means that international pressure on the Indonesian in the case of Papua is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread acts of violence" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir shrugged off the accusation when he told reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia still has a democratic system and the media is free, so it is difficult to mask evidence of human rights violations."
Local people are calling for the participation of foreign governments.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people were chanting, according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the slogan “we want freedom.”
Indonesia is scheduled to hold another election in 2019, but Papuans say they will not vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people associated with the shooting in Paniai," said Gobau, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai — in addition to living in constant fear of a rogue army — are wallowing in poverty, poor education, and a health system.
Gobai claims that the inhabitants of Paniai, like other Papuans, consider their vote to be a “debt” that has to be repaid to Yokowi.
"They don't want money, they want justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the families of the victims of the Paniai shootings, they continue in the last symbolic act of defiance: burying the bodies of the victims on the property opposite the police and army station.
Aware that justice will never be done enough, at least it will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus said, his head down.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy intercepted a huge shipment of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy has seized a yacht in the Pacific carrying 1.46 tons of cocaine worth about 256 million dollars.
The shipment was heading to Australia.
The four-member crew of the ship, believed to be from Lithuania and Latvia, were arrested.
The yacht, named Afalina, set sail from South America and was taken to a port in Noumea, the capital of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
Australia’s intelligence agency said it would work with its international partners to determine exactly where the drugs were coming from and where they were going, and to expose the “Lithuanian syndicate.”
“We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures taken to stop large quantities of drugs going to Australia,” said Col Blanch, the company’s chief executive.
Drugs were destroyed in Nouméa this week.
Australia is an attractive target for drug smugglers due to high street prices.
The country is also facing the problem of an increasing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current raid is not the first.
Last month, three men were accused of transporting large quantities of drugs from the United States to Australia, who tried to smuggle them across the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
Seniors do not feel thirsty, drinking is necessary to remind them.
The problem may be in the homes for the elderly, the solution, according to the doctor from the Geriatric Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague Pavla Mádlova, could be infusions of saline solution, which are injected with a thin needle under the skin.
However, they are currently only used in medical facilities.
The older a person is, the more the amount of water in his body decreases.
“It also loses the feeling of thirst, so seniors generally take less fluids and get dehydrated very quickly,” said Mádlová.
Two liters should definitely drink.
"But getting so much fluid into an old person is a big problem," she added.
In nursing homes, she says, there is often no doctor to look after it.
In hospitals, dehydration is usually treated with infusions.
"I think it should be gradually introduced there, too, so that they can receive subcutaneous infusions," she said.
According to her, up to two half-liter bottles of saline can be supplied to old people per day.
Lack of fluids can cause malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration manifests itself as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day the old man will say he can't get out of bed, he's talking in confusion," she added.
In case of neglect, it can result in a stroke.
The blood thickens and clogs the blood vessels in the brain, there is also a risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with a duvet, a maximum of cotton sheet.
Disposable diapers can also be a problem.
“It’s more demanding for the caregiver, but it would be ideal to expose the patient from time to time and let the skin air out,” she said.
The Torch Tower Burns for the Second Time in Dubai
In Dubai on Friday, one of the largest residential skyscrapers in the world caught fire. Firefighters had to evacuate all residents of the 337-meter-high and 79-storey buildings.
In the last two years, this is the second fire of this high-rise building, which bears the apt name The Torch.
All residents of the building were evacuated and there were no injuries. The cause of the fire is unknown.
“We were asleep and the alarm woke us up. We heard a scream.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor,” said Geroge, one of the occupants of the skyscraper.
Dubai Civil Defense said firefighters managed to bring the fire under control around 4 a.m., then continued to cool the building.
Government officials have added that they are providing alternative accommodation for the affected residents.
The incident could once again spark a debate about the safety of materials used to line high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of an investigation launched by Torch management after the fire in 2015 showed that the most damage was to the lining and external panels used for decoration or insulation.
British police said the insulation and cladding system at London's Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of fire in a June fire that killed nearly 80 people.
The results of the survey showed that more than one in five passengers to the United States carry prohibited items on board the aircraft.
A survey of passengers showed that more than 20 percent of them knowingly or unknowingly carried prohibited items through the control station of the US government agency Transportation Security Administration on board the aircraft. At least six percent of passengers boarded the aircraft with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers said they were late in finding out they were travelling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A survey conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. — and answered by more than 1,000 respondents — found that younger passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to attempting to consciously travel with an item that is banned by the TSA, 19.7% were passengers with several thousand flying hours compared to less than 15% of Gen X members.
The most common items that have escaped the attention of the TSA are food and alcohol.
More than three per cent of respondents knowingly carried a sharp object over their guard, while 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men also admitted to intentionally carrying illicit drugs on board the aircraft.
The company said it was conducting research among travelers around the world to find out how many of them accidentally carried unauthorized items through airport controls and how many did so on purpose.
Unsurprisingly, the majority of people who have carried unauthorized items – either knowingly or unknowingly – travel by plane very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often do not know what liquids and in what quantities they can carry to the plane.
Unsurprisingly, the TSA seized the largest amount of liquid it had just banned.
For a time, people thought that the TSA would treat books in the same way as smuggled goods.
The carriage of liquids is permitted on domestic flights, not on international flights.
EPA Chief Scott Pruitt on Postponement of Planned Directives to Reduce Obama Administration Emissions
After the Environmental Protection Agency was sued by fifteen states, its chief Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the former Obama administration’s carbon-dioxide-reduction plan.
Pruitt has introduced changes to his plan, making it more responsive than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge filed against his previous position in the federal appeals court.
This concerns the latest deadline set for October 1, when states should start implementing the 2015 regulation to reduce the amount of ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay the deal by one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid “interference with local decisions or threatening economic growth.”
Pruitt, who served as Oklahoma’s state attorney general before being named EPA chief by President Donald Trump, has long served as a staunch opponent of tougher environmental regulations.
Since settling in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or delayed regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
Wednesday’s sudden turnaround is the biggest legal setback for Pruitt’s regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA’s executor had exceeded his authority in an effort to delay the Obama administration’s incorporation of the plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed his version of ozone standards and strengthened the EPA’s commitment to working with states through comprehensive processes and meeting new standards within a given time frame.
“During the previous administration, the EPA often missed deadlines and waited to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to settle and further set plans,” said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
“We do not believe in regulation through litigation and we take compliance with the deadline seriously.
We never joke about our status and the authority that comes with it.”
However, the EPA said in a statement that Pruitt could use “the possibility of a delay and any other legally available authority” at some point to ensure that the regulations “will be based on sound policy and the most available information.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive rewriting of the ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet passed the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group did not intend to allow legal pressure.
“The reversal of the EPA’s view – following our litigation – is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by air pollution,” Schneiderman said.
New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Ground-level ozone occurs when common pollutants emitted by automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants, and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause severe respiratory problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists applaud Pruitt’s sudden change.
“It’s worrying how much pressure needs to be exerted to change the thinking of those in charge and protect the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to grapple with the Trump administration’s ideological drive to help polluters and special interests.”
He poured acid on the man, but he's not dangerous in court.
You never know what might happen to you.
One minute you’re at home with your family and you’re laughing, the next minute your whole life changes from the ground up.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate met Andreas Christopheros from Great Britain, whose face was slapped with acid by an unknown assailant, who was eventually exonerated.
This was reported by the Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the door at the Christopheros house.
Andreas stood up to open the door.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door who was supposed to deliver Christmas gifts to the family that day.
Instead, a cruel surprise awaited him.
The man, whom he had never seen in his life, poured acid on him immediately after opening without warning, saying, "This is for you, my friend."
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell apart on me like nothing, and I felt nothing but incredible pain on my skin,” Andreas said.
The family rushed him to the hospital, but there his loved ones learned the terrible news - according to doctors, he had no chance to survive.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent of the patients had a face that doctors tried to put together using skin from other parts of the patient’s body.
A major complication for Christopheros was the loss of the eyelids.
It's probably the most painful thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he said.
Today, Christopheros has completed twelve operations, which are far from being the last.
The injuries suffered by victims of acid attacks can require hundreds of surgeries and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after difficult and long-term treatment, the victims have scar tissue scarred for the rest of their lives.
“Sometimes people don’t recover and they fight deformity and disfigurement throughout their lives,” said Professor Peter Dziewulski, a spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The assailant was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is sure that an unknown man must have mistaken him for someone else.
The perpetrator believed he was taking revenge on a man who sexually abused his loved one.
The police investigated the whole case and then tracked down the assailant.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later the verdict to the astonishment of Christopher's family changed fundamentally.
"The three judges ultimately concluded that the sentence should be lifted because the man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
Over the past few years, the number of attacks with corrosive substances has increased significantly.
The interior ministry said it plans to issue new guidelines to prosecutors on the classification of caustics.
These should be classified as dangerous weapons.
However, the victims of such attacks are not going to give up.
They are demanding that the UK government impose stricter and longer prison sentences on people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also require stricter controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often commonly available in different shops, as these are different cleaning agents.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates Dubai burned at night the famous skyscraper The Torch, which belongs to the largest residential buildings in the world.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense, the residents of the 80-story building were evacuated in time and no one was injured.
According to a Dubai police spokesman, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upwards.
However, according to several residents of the house, it was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," said one of the tenants.
Also, according to another tenant, quoted by Reuters, the fire broke out on the top floors and spread down with falling hot debris.
We were asleep.
We woke up to the alarm, people screaming.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," the tenant George described the events.
Another witness told CNN that about 40 apartments were engulfed in flames.
The fire destroyed at least two cars on the ground when they were hit by burning parts of the building.
About two hours later, the fire was brought under control.
The cause of its occurrence is not yet known.
Witnesses said there was a power outage in the surrounding buildings.
A massive fire also damaged Dubai’s The Torch skyscraper in February 2015, destroying more than 100 apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the whole building.
No one was injured because the residents were evacuated in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and became the tallest residential building in the world at 352 meters.
The following year, another Dubai skyscraper broke the record.
The bodybuilder had an incredible 14 doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, a sample of 23-year-old Ippolito contained a diverse collection of illicit drugs, ranging from steroids to diuretics to drugs for Parkinson’s disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix did not help him to the title, he finished fourth.
Now the bodybuilder faces a four-year distance and criminal prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vasto tested positive for 11 doping substances, a record amount for the athletes involved.
The third-tier player, according to his words, began taking steroids a year before, when he fell into bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondrá<0xC4><0x8D>ková in the Czech Republic.
She hugged passionately with her ex-lover!
Barely Lucka Vondrá<0xC4><0x8D>ková entered the territory of the Czech Republic, she is in one round.
It also attracts attention wherever it goes.
The last time she fell in the arms of her former lover Michal Dlouh<0xC3><0xBD>, with whom she lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years older and already longing for a family.
Lucia was only 19 years old at the time, and she certainly did not want to hang her career on a nail.
So they left each other, but the friends remained to this day.
This was also proved at the press conference of TV Prima, where they met after a long time.
Coincidentally, they both blended into a blue color.
At first they ignored each other, but then they got closer, and Lucie laughed at Michal's jokes until she grabbed her belly.
Then they hugged each other and posed willingly for the photographers.
Their meeting, however, was not a coincidence, because they will play together a couple in the new series of Prima Captain Exner.
In the UK, Islamists have been given life sentences for plotting an assassination.
LONDON (Reuters) - A British court on Thursday sentenced to life in prison four members of an Islamist cell called the Three Musketeers, which prosecutors said was planning a terrorist attack against police and the army.
The four men, two of whom had attended a training camp in Pakistan and had previously been convicted of similar acts, were arrested last August.
Authorities at the time believed he was about to launch an immediate attack.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions meaning “infidels” in Arabic, and a model gun.
This happened when an MI5 agent placed a listening device in the car.
“Recent assassinations have shown the horror that could have been caused by the defendants if they had not been stopped,” said Sue Hemming, the prosecutor’s spokeswoman.
Three convicts aged 28, 25 and 33 can apply for release after 20 years.
A fourth convict, 38, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
During the trial in London, the men claimed they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car had been placed there by an MI5 agent.
The court also heard him, but then rejected the defendants' claims.
Thursday was the warmest day of the year.
They measured 38.3°C in the Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>n region.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained at the top for only two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius, which were recorded in Strá<0xC5><0xBE>nice in the Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>n region, it exceeded Thursday, which became the warmest day so far this year.
This was confirmed by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
On Tuesday, however, there were not many temperature records.
On Tuesday, records were broken for 35 of the 145 weather stations spanning more than 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures.
For example, in Strá<0xC5><0xBE>nice, the temperature on Thursday was the same as the previous record set in 2013.
In Lednice, B<0xC5><0x99>eclav region on Thursday, 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree, and in Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice, Brno region, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as in the case of Strá<0xC5><0xBE>nice, came from 2013.
In the west it was ten degrees lower.
High temperatures appeared on Thursday mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strá<0xC5><0xBE>nice, the greatest heat was in Dyjákovice in the Znojmo region and Brod nad Dyj<0xC3><0xAD> in the B<0xC5><0x99>eclav region, where mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not surpass the record.
In contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Bohemia, according to the CHMI website, the highest temperatures so far on Thursday were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures started to rise there only later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subside, according to the CHMI, and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
In most places of Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the south-east of Moravia on Saturday.
China is short of tourists.
Beijing is losing billions on visa policy.
China has been trying for decades to assert its influence without the use of force.
It spends $10 billion a year to support language schools and build universities abroad, pushing its entertainment industry to foreign markets and trying to attract Western tourists.
This is not the case in Beijing.
Local state media are talking about a plan to make tourism the driving force of economic transformation and modernization.
Last year, however, the number of arrivals increased by only 3.8 percent, and about 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, to the fact that, despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, according to Professor of Economics at Beijing University Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for itself is China’s visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free travel to China, and the citizens of the others have to deal with the visa in advance.
Chinese authorities in the U.S. are, therefore, crowds comparable to the celebration of the Chinese New Year.
A visa costs $140, but if you don’t want to wait long hours in line, you have to pay $100 or more for additional services.
Such restrictions create significant economic barriers.
A study in the Journal of Economics and Finance found that the need for a visa reduced the number of visitors to a country by 70 percent.
In 2015, just two million Americans visited mainland China, while 1.8 million Americans visited Hong Kong, which accounts for less than 3 percent of China’s gross domestic product and is home to less than 1 percent of its population.
China often exacerbates this problem when it uses tourism to pursue its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China cut traffic to South Korea in the spring as part of a rift over South Korea’s missile defense system, the South Koreans retaliated and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan saw an increase of 85 percent.
All of this has an impact on macroeconomic stability.
According to a recent report by the US Federal Reserve Bank, China could leave as much as $190 billion as a result of Chinese foreign travel, while China will receive about $35 billion a year in foreign currency sales to incoming tourists.
According to official balance-of-payments figures, China ran a $217 billion tourism deficit last year, equivalent to 44 percent of China’s total merchandise trade surplus.
Thus, a small number of tourists are inflicting a very painful blow on a country that is anxiously preventing the outflow of capital.
However, the above factors are only one manifestation of more general restraint towards foreigners.
In many parts of China, virtually no one has heard of immigrants.
In 2013, there were less than one million foreigners living in China.
There are many more cities in the United States.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroads of immigration, has twice as much.
A number of scientific works show that immigrants usually revive economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
You won’t find them in China.
It will be politically challenging to solve these problems, but the proposed step is to simplify the visa system.
Other Asian countries, notably India and Vietnam, have recently made great efforts to simplify and reduce the cost of visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
Deadly venomous reptiles have been bred in the Pilsen Zoo.
The Plze<0xC5><0x88> Kingdom of Poison can enjoy the offspring of three rare, deadly reptiles.
In the exhibition, visitors will see only all nine newly born Turkish vipers.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2000 meters.
"It's also growing in length," zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba said.
The young of the other two species, the Death Eaters and the Red Cobra, will still be gaining strength in the breeding grounds of the garden.
We still can't say when people will see them.
"We don't want to lose them," said the nurse, Miroslav Dohnal, adding that it could take a year or two.
Australian mortal vipers came into the world eight, they are the descendants of a breeding pair originally from the population around Sydney.
"The individual that visitors can see in the exhibit is a mortal from the Perth area," Wobruba said, adding that in human care, the mortal needs to winter for 6-8 weeks at a temperature of 13 degrees Celsius.
One hundred percent success was accompanied by a swarm of African spitting red cobras.
A couple in the Pilsen zoo hatched from four eggs a total of four cubs.
"Incubation took 65 days," Vobruba added.
This species in nature sprays poison on its victims, at a distance of up to four meters.
Aiming at the eyes, it can cause permanent blindness.
Young animals of all three species feed on mice in the zoo.
Within 40 days in the garden, they still expect hatchlings from a clutch of black mambas, the eggs are stored in an incubator.
According to an unverified transcript of the phone call, Trump is putting pressure on Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The Washington Post published a transcript of President Trump’s phone calls with leaders from Mexico and Australia.
In a January 27 phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly proclaiming that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The president accused him of publicly denouncing the construction of the wall, allegedly saying, “You can’t talk like that in the press.”
As part of his campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the southern border and promised to pay Mexico for it.
The transcript of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also leaked to the public, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the agreement on U.S. surveillance of refugees heading to Australia was “ridiculous” and “stupid” and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement — which came about under President Obama’s administration — he would look “drugged” after proposing a ban on refugees entering the U.S.
Trump ended the call after explaining to Turnbull that “this is my most uncomfortable call of the day.”
Tusk again testified at the prosecutor's office over Smolensk.
"There's nothing to worry about," the dead president's brother, PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski, told Tusk.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski will not intimidate me," Tusk replied, pointing out to the country's current leadership that they are trying to abuse justice against political rivals.
As he left the prosecutor’s office, a crowd was waiting for Tusk, according to TVN, who chanted Donald Tusk! and wished the politician a Hundred Years!.
Tusk thanked him for his support and assured him that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski will not frighten me."
According to him, he does not blame the prosecutors, but he has no doubt that justice is supposed to serve the current Polish rulers as a tool against opponents, the opposition or people they do not like, and I am afraid that I belong to this group.
This was the second time he had been interrogated.
The ex-prime minister was questioned at the prosecutor’s office for the second time, this time he was supposed to be questioned about mistakes in the autopsy of the victims of the Smolensk catastrophe.
There was also the exchange of bodies in coffins.
Families were forbidden to open coffins, and there had to be some reason for that.
And the reason was that they were afraid of the scandal, because it would burden Polish-Russian relations.
"Maintaining good relations at all costs, despite such a terrible event, should have served to make Donald Tusk someone very important in the EU," Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski said on Catholic television Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would thwart Tusk’s chances of winning the most important seat in the union, from which Poland has absolutely nothing.
Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski also said he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that things could turn out differently with Donald Tusk, but she did not take note.
Tusk was questioned by prosecutors for eight hours on April 19.
Even then, he did not speak as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many of his calls for questioning were seen as part of an apparent effort by the Polish government and PiS chief Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking him to various scandals.
In Poland, the prosecutor’s office is subordinate to the Minister of Justice, who performs the role of the prosecutor general.
The summons to the hearing came shortly after Tusk was elected head of the European Council, which Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski tried hard but in vain to prevent, among other things, during Merkel’s visit to Warsaw.
In the end, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová protested alone at the EU summit against the extension of Tusk’s mandate.
In this case, the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán also left Warsaw in the lurch.
Burma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs vote?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote again on the composition of the Chamber of Deputies from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections in 2013.
It follows from the decree that regulates the delivery of ballots abroad.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared an update of it, it is currently in the comment procedure.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted for MPs abroad.
"Since the last amendment of the decree in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the ministry said in a statement.
“In some countries, new representative offices have been established, some offices have been closed, or there has been a change in the level of representation,” the report said.
The decree contains two annexes, the first of which lists the representative offices on which paper ballots are delivered.
This group of offices includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, i.e. Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a ballot in the version for the press.
The list is changing with the decree.
Four years ago, Czechs could vote, for example, at the Czech embassy in Libya or in Zimbabwe.
Today, both embassies are closed.
The Czech Republic also abolished its representation in Bamako, Malaysia, and Kyoto, Japan.
There will be no elections at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed it in 2014 because of the war in eastern Ukraine.
They are now on the list of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, the Senegalese capital Dakar, and Lusaka, Zambia.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation to include the Consulate General in Iraq's Irbil and Chengdu, the capital of China's S'Chuan Province.
Voting tickets will also be available for registered voters at the Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to choose their deputies in polling stations at embassies or consulates four times so far.
Before each election, the State Electoral Commission shall determine by lot the region for whose candidates a vote is to be taken abroad.
The first time was in 2002 when the South Moravian candidates were elected.
In the next two elections, Czechs abroad voted among South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, the Central Bohemian Region was chosen as this year.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
At the premiere 15 years ago, about 3,800 people came to vote, in 2006 there were about 6,700, four years later 8222.
For the early parliamentary elections four years ago, 10,571 voters came to the embassies.
Moore’s Ford Bridge Massacre: Activists Recall Racist Lynching
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove past the sighting residents of Monroe, Georgia, and curled toward the Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before a car with four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked its way.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - pulled a cigarette for a long time and stared at the windshield of the car.
Inside, the passengers trembled with fear.
'We want that n---and Roger! 'shouted the man.
"Bring it to me!"
The silence is broken by the roar of a young black man who is pulled out of the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is just a reconstruction of the events that took place on July 22.
But when one of the men throws a noose over "Roger's" neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have regularly returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to reconstruct that fateful night in 1946 when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of the Kuklux Klan.
No one has ever been tried for murder.
“It’s amazing that not a single person has been arrested in all these years – even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organise the reenactment.
"It's a stain on our history and a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia congressman and lifelong civil rights activist.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event represents a dramatic call to action, reminding the Monroe community every year that justice has not been done enough.
“We demand prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but above all justice,” Brooks said.
"Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot begin."
On July 27, 1946, a forensic doctor covers up one of the lynching victims at Moore's Ford.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were scheduled to participate in the lynching.
However, no one has yet been prosecuted.
Despite the suspects remaining at large for decades, civil rights advocates argue that both the reasons for the lynching – politics and sex – were known to all residents of the city.
In April 1946, by a Supreme Court decision, residents of the black state of Georgia were granted the right to participate in the elections that were scheduled for the summer for the first time.
And it was during the summer election season, according to the FBI, that black-skinned farmer Roger Malcolm was supposed to stab white-skinned landowners Barnett Hester during a skirmish - allegedly because of his wife.
According to Brooks, Hester was said to have had intercourse with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and to have brought her into a different state.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, the then prominent owner of white-skinned land, Loy Harrison, made a $600 bail for Malcolm.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
On their way back from the prison, just before the entrance to Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects blocked their way.
"As it turns out, the murders were planned and orchestrated by Harrison," she said.
“It is also clear that there was a collusion between state and local law enforcement, who not only participated in the lynching, but also disposed of the evidence and concealed the identity of the witnesses.”
Brooks made a brief comment on the matter.
"It was a massacre for the right to vote," he said.
“The murders had a clear subtext for all black locals: ‘This is how you’re going to end up if you register and go to vote’.”
The annual Moore’s Ford Bridge reenactment has been organized by Cassandra Greene for almost a decade.
Her performance is pictorial, engaging and apt, showing a deep-seated racism that many would like to see extinct in modern America.
It’s not easy to watch this reconstruction, and it’s even harder to look away, but Greene says it makes sense.
“No one wants to talk about lynching, because we have to face the unpleasant feelings that lurk in each of us,” Greene said.
"But we can't have a relationship if you don't listen to what I've been through."
The main rehearsals for this year's reenactment began in June, and on the very first day, approximately 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest blacks - rushed into the room where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is an assistant director.
For many years he played the leader of the Kukluxklan, but according to him, the role is exhausting.
"It makes me feel bad because it contradicts who I am," Marbaugh said.
“I think it’s very important to remember this part of history regularly because we never want to go back to that time.”
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcolm, or Barnett Hester, rehearse their roles.
The show begins with a fight - Malcolm quarrels with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get off my property, n---e!"
You can't have Rascona.
There's a skirmish.
At that point, everyone (at least every black actor) will burst out laughing.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" asks Rascona.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," Greene says cheerfully.
"I just don't think white people used to say 'n--r' in that tone."
"Exactly," one of the black-skinned actors blurts out.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility replaces the feeling of rapprochement.
Everyone wants the performance to be authentic, just enough to make it look like four victims of a massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
This time, Rascona emphasizes the correct pronunciation of the word on N.
No one's laughing now.
The show ends violently and quickly.
The roar, the gunshots... and the silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of the actors and sings Billie Holiday's mournful song "Strange Fruit".
With every word, there is sadness in the room.
Against the background of all this, about a dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
In the audience there are almost the same number of blacks and whites.
A couple had arrived from Ithaca, New York, many of whom were from nearby.
Each of them tolerates the local humid climate for almost eight hours, and Brooks leads them in a crowd to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until now, murder could be viewed from a distance, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is spooky.
With the last words of the song, Greene invites the crowd to attend the inspection of the bodies.
The children knelt at the victims' heads, watching the fake blood and still bodies and whispering something in their ear.
'They're not dead, 'said the little boy.
A few minutes pass, and Greene thanks the audience.
Actors clean up the rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the leader of the Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona hugs his two fellow actors and weeps in their arms; in the end, he is overcome by emotion.
"It's all right," whispered one of the women.
"We know the role is against you.
But you had a reason.”
Later that day, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple is passionately talking about a performance with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski could hardly find the words to express her feelings about today's performance.
“It’s hard to listen to those ugly words and look at those hideous acts... done by people who look like you and do it because they look like you,” she said.
“It makes me realize that lynching is still a topical issue,” she added, adding that “it’s just called a police skirmish.”
Across the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in the courtroom, enjoying dinner while talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he has already started planning the performance for the next year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to experience - but it is also a moment to reflect," he said.
"If we don't learn from this, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are condemned to repeat it.
I love the instructions for use.
A friend of mine says that the instructions for use are read only by a shrew.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often true surrealism.
With nostalgia, I remember times long past, where the instructions for using anything was rather a rare phenomenon.
For example, my first turntable contained only one piece of paper with hieroglyphs showing the connection of some components, all of them with some secret markings.
Years later, when something went wrong inside of me, I offered that document to a shaman who wasn't afraid to unscrew the back plate.
With a grin, he advised me what the paper with the labyrinth of lines was for.
Yes, it was a familiar aid in chronic toilet paper defecation.
Playfully he found a disconnected wire and allowed me to listen to expensive vinyl pancakes again.
The new era brought new directions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where the sliced grep simply stuck, required about ten images.
Especially good was a sketch with a description of how to insert one part into another.
The set was two-part, and another procedure was simply not possible.
Putting it on the contrary required considerable effort with the need to break off certain plastic components.
My disdain for the manual ended with my SEAT Leon.
The year of production 2003 still had such a book with instructions for minor repairs, among which was, among other things, the replacement of the blinker bulb.
It was easy.
Three steps in total and the work was to be completed.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual forgot to mention that while the bulb on the right went to replace really only in three steps.
1. Remove the cover.
2. Screw out the cracked bulb and screw in the new one.
3. slide in the cover.
The bulb on the left had a problem in the form of the location of the battery cover.
At first, I thought that by inserting the right upper limb into the inside of the car, I would find some spring, a screw, with which I could easily move the cover, and then I would follow the points of the 1-3 thrifty author of the service book.
The error of the footbridge.
The cover had no place, no room for Cinderella's slender hand, let alone Slezan's.
I lost half an hour of my life, completely without any success.
The condition was further amplified by the entrance of my wife to the garage, which was evoked by the roar and the words that she hears from my mouth quite exceptionally.
'What are you doing here? 'she asked me insincerely.
My answer took about 90 seconds, however, if I omit the vulgar terms, there are only two words left to publish.
I'm changing the light bulb.
"And why is it taking you so long?" she said with a sentence that might be her last in a long-term relationship.
I slowly explained the problem to her, with the main emphasis on the procedure of torture of the author of the instruction manual, where blessing with hot iron on the hand that wrote the instruction, then cutting her out so that she could never write anything again, was just an introduction to the wide range of instructions Hammer on the witch, including his commission burning on the pot.
"How about unpacking the box?" the woman said, removing the battery.
In sheer desperation, this happened and then step 1-3 was as easy and quick as on the right.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
Until the day I got a call from a colleague who was just waking up from a state of collapse after a check-up by two officials of the State Drug Control Service.
I know him as a balanced colleague who has experienced the possible and the impossible in the field and who can interpret even wild stories in an undisturbed voice.
"Imagine I was fined for not having my handwashing instructions posted," he told me in a weak voice.
Gradually, I got the whole problem out of him, which was that he did not have a picture manual over the washbasin in the patients' toilet, how to wash his hands.
His argument to a commission official that adults can usually wash their hands, and that pictograms are not needed to master the usual activities of decent people, did not have a healing effect and cost him considerable money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that simply rinsing the washed palms with running water was a primitive act at the Cro-Magnon level, that modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performed this ceremony in ten steps.
So it is necessary to say that it is necessary to release water from the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end there is a joyful finding that a person has washed his hands exactly as ordered by the butcher from S<0xC3><0x9A>KL.
Finally, I have to point out that I got inspired and I am preparing a detailed plan for the activity on the toilet.
In the matter of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there the problem will not arise, with urination, due to certain differences of both sexes, it will be necessary to hang out the instructions of two.
The problem remains the pictograms, because to create a perfect procedure means an accurate drawing of all the anatomical details, which could arouse some indignation among the prude visitor to the toilet, despite the fact that he can finally learn that he has been wiping the appropriate hole throughout his life by a completely wrong procedure.
Pearson to lay off 3,000 more employees, cut dividend in bid to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would lay off an additional 3,000 employees and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring programme aimed at changing the business model.
Another wave of layoffs, which CEO John Fallon said would occur in late 2018 and early 2019, follows the company’s previous decision to lay off 4,000 employees as part of a previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) in May as part of a third program to cut costs in a bid to revive declining trade due to the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Bertelsmann’s Penguin Random House last month, said its outlook for this year remained unchanged after reporting a 1% increase in core sales in the first half of the year to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, NATO said in a statement.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Qarabagh district.
This month, Afghanistan was hit by a bomb attack - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in an explosion at a Herat mosque.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in a statement that the explosion occurred after the patrol, along with members of the Afghan army, was attacked by “a local person with a homemade explosive device.”
The statement further said that all wounded soldiers are out of danger and are in a U.S. military hospital at Baghram Air Force Base.
The growing power of the Taliban and a group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh area is a major source of concern for NATO allies in nearby Baghram, the report said.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of whom 20% died in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul’s Shia district.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On May 31, a major explosion in the city centre killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since U.S. troops overthrew the Taliban government in 2001.
The violence is undermining an already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops to help the country’s military and police forces.
According to reporters, the suicide attacks, which he has trained in recent weeks with public confidence in the government, its regulations and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghan<0xC3><0xAD>n, have shaken.
In response to the lawsuit, the EPA reconsidered its decision to postpone the rules on smoking.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has reversed its decision to delay an Obama administration law that ordered states to cut emissions, just a day after the agency was sued by 15 states.
On Wednesday night, the EPA announced its decision to transfer the “Ozone Standards 2015” with the words that it sets out the agency’s commitment to working with states.
“We believe in dialogue with our national partners and we will listen to their views,” EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced an effort by the EPA to delay ozone standards — which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and, based on measurements, set limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen of the most democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit on Tuesday on the grounds that the EPA's conduct was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration is seeking to avoid many of the environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama – in Trump’s words – in an effort to kick-start economic growth.
But the new government’s effort has launched countermeasures by Democrats and conservative groups who fear the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA states on its website that breathing air containing ozone “may reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.
The singer Ladislav Bubnár got hit and blood flowed!
You may have already registered this, relatively new singer with us, in June of this year, when this so far almost unknown singer in our country organized a monstrous event on Czech terms, at which he hosted such leading personalities as master Karel Gott, Lucie B<0xC3><0xAD>lá, Simona Krainová and many others, and the event was moderated by none other than Leo<0xC5><0xA1> Mar<0xC5><0xA1>.
The purpose was simple, to show the public and to present his music video for the song Sara, whose baptism was made by the personalities just named.
But few people know that the filming of the video, which took place in Russia, was not without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big shoot with the stars of the Russian national ballet and it was not without a real embarrassment.
The song is very emotional and is based on the unhappy love of two lovers.
For the dramatic nature of the scene, the singer's juice was supposed to indicate a slap in the face in the video clip.
At one point, however, he hit him so hard and directly in the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a blow, I didn't expect it, immediately blood came out of my nose," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers told each other on the set that it was an accident and Ladislav did not have time to react in time.
Fortunately, the injury wasn’t severe enough to affect the next shoot.
The aforementioned video clip of the young artist is now brought to you, you can also record the scene with the punch in it.
The failed version with blood, however, was not preferred.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko spoke at the meeting about the possibilities of a mutual duel
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, the two boxers who could stage the most exciting lightweight boxing match, met for the first time at a meeting on Tuesday.
Each of them was in a separate room at ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia – the undefeated World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion – walked down to the lobby, where he welcomed Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization’s springweight champion.
Following Garcia's victory, based on a unanimous decision against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's showtime match, both boxers made the list of the top five lightweight boxers.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck."
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on Saturday at 19:00.
Boxers pose for photographers, and Lomachenko’s manager Egis Klimas adds that a potential fight between boxers would be a “perfect test”.
"I'm a former featherweight champion," Garcia adds.
“I had to put on weight because of the game with Broner (67kg), but I’m not that big.
I'm small on my 63 kg.
I would like to return to the light weight category.
Lomachenko has to gain weight to get to the light weight... then we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Why not do it to them.”
Lomachenko agrees.
"Boxing would be good for this game."
Klimas has made a request for payment for viewing - which is part of his strategy. Lomachenko should make his lightweight debut at the end of this year and next year to face Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in the match against the winner of the duel Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell in September.
“The match should be in the pay-per-view style, that’s what the fans want,” said Garcia, who later said he was open to the possibility of broadcasting the match through a television station that would come up with the best offer.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else is going to attract that kind of attention.
We'll wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said he recognized Lomachenko as an “amazing boxer” and could take part in his match on Saturday.
Lomachenko, however, was not swayed by Garcia's praise when he said the Riverside three-division champion looked "very slow...sorry Mike, but you're asking for a knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then boxing.
Both boxers said they felt a rising tension in front of each other in a duel.
"You won't forget this game.
No other game attracts so much attention.
And I will be very happy to put it on the fire," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey."
It will be a great match.”
A young couple disappeared without a trace 12 years ago.
Their car was now found at the bottom of the Volga.
Two young Russians, Ilya Zhirnov and Kira Cherkasov, have been missing since December 2005.
An extensive search was launched for them, but without success.
The police eventually closed the investigation due to lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they would not know what had happened to the couple.
After 12 years, the story came to a sad end.
The wreck of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the Volga River in the town of Cheboksary in the Chuvash region.
Only thanks to the documents that remained in the car, the police were able to identify the couple.
The documents survived a decade underwater, without them, it would have taken the police much longer to find out the identity of those found.
The couple was last seen when Zhirnov borrowed a car from his father so he could pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
He reported his discovery to the Cheboksary police, who dragged the car to the beach the next day.
Investigators believe the young couple's death was an accident caused by a frosty road leading around the river.
However, the investigation is ongoing and further details will be made public once it is completed.
Latest results of tests to determine the age limit of asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of tests of asylum seekers in Sweden, who were subjected to a new method assessing their age, show that over 80 percent of people were asked as over 18 years old, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (R<0xC3><0x83><0xC2><0xA4>ttsmedicinalverket) started the new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is a more accurate assessment of applicants in the framework of the evaluation of asylum applications. The measure was taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationverket) was criticized for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6,880 cases for investigation and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests carried out from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) were judged to be over 18, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency judged the respondent to be "possibly over 18".
In another 423 cases, it was decided that the respondent was "possibly under the age of 18".
Tests are only taken if the age of the respondent is questionable.
According to Johan G<0xC3><0x83><0xC2><0xB6>ransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
"Compared to last month, the statistics are kept in a busy track and the numbers are very similar," he told The Local.
A higher number of applicants whose age has been estimated to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers are lying about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that in 442 cases, it found that “the person in question is 18 years of age or older.”
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the respondent stated that he would be 18 this year.
The medical method of determining the age, which includes x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of the knee joints, which are then assessed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who, among other things, deals with assessing the biological maturity of people to determine the age at which a person has gone through puberty.
“I had reason to think about this issue and I don’t think these types of measurements to assess age are correct.
Assessment of biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we cannot determine the age with accuracy, we should not pretend otherwise," he told the Metro newspaper.
The forensic medical agency Agency's G<0xC3><0x83><0xC2><0xB6>ransson defended the decision, saying: "In general, the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the respondent is just below the age of 18, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all respondents.
Trump threatened the president of Mexico by phone.
In a January phone call to Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened not to meet with him if he publicly said his country would not pay to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.
Trump said in an interview that funding will be arranged somehow, although he admitted that it will have to be secured from other sources.
Trump also spoke openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This is according to transcripts of interviews published by the Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made building a wall on the southern border with Mexican money one of the main promises in his campaign last year.
In his first interview with the Mexican president shortly after taking office, Trump chastised Pena Nieto for being critical of his wall plan.
He portrayed the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pressed the Mexican president not to publicly say his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say that to the press," Trump repeatedly said in a January 27 interview, and threatened to cut off contact with the Mexican president if he continued to make defiant statements.
The funding is going to come up somehow and it will end well.
“But if you’re going to say Mexico won’t pay for the wall, then I don’t want to hang out with you guys anymore because that’s unacceptable to me,” Trump said.
The wall is the least important thing we are talking about, but politically it may be the most important.
Trump issued an executive order to build the wall shortly after taking power.
Mexico rejects the construction and financing of the 3,200-kilometer-long wall, which has strained relations between the two countries.
At the end of March, Trump said that the project will be paid by the United States for the time being.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the July G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump’s January 28 phone call with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull.
The head of the White House called the conversation ridiculous.
He was led to this conclusion by an exchange of views on an agreement under which Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States accepting persons from internment facilities in Pacific island states.
Trump initially thought the deal was stupid, but later agreed to it.
“You can certainly say that this is not a deal you made, but you’re going to have to stick to it,” Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, the telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example, when Trump praised the Australian refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats as a good idea.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
Suddenly, the tone of the conversation became tense.
“I hate receiving these people,” Trump said.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
"They won't be great people to go work for local dairy farmers," he said.
In the interview, he also noted that the refugee could become an assassin from Boston in five years.
At the end of January, roughly a week after arriving at the White House, Trump had telephone conversations with a number of world leaders, often several in a single day.
Turnbull's call was the least pleasant of the day.
Before he finished, he pointed out that he had previously had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
They executed Rana's killer in front of a crowd.
Her father watched as well.
The execution took place in a square in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose Rana Almatari, who lived in his neighborhood, as his victim.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her to his father's house, where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He then raped her body, which he then tossed near the mosque.
The violent death of a young girl has affected an entire country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of the thousand-headed crowd that had gathered to witness the execution.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
The victim’s father told the media his feelings after the execution.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's a new day in my life.
The other members of the family were also present, together with the crowd shouting the slogan "Long live justice".
The perpetrator was brought to the square by a police van from which he was dragged.
Officers tied him up on his stomach.
One of the members turned his weapon against him and fired from the immediate vicinity.
The present crowd celebrated every blow that was fired.
Mr al-Almatari told the MailOnline website that justice had been done in accordance with the country’s legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia law have prevailed," he added.
I stood in the Square of Liberation in Sana'a, waiting for the execution of my daughter's murderer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Rana's tiny body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
I and my wife Jamileh are grateful that justice has been done.
The police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would fall into hateful madness, grab and lynch the murderer.
The execution was ordered by the court, which is under the administration of the Shiite Houthis.
Maghrabi was initially sentenced to 100 lashes after his arrest, but his action sparked such outrage that the judge decided to sentence him to death.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl's disappearance on June 27.
Rana's family knew him well.
When the police searched the cellar of his house, they found evidence that the man had planned his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could have been his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful to the Wound.
"Our family has no enemies, and the injuries sustained by the body of the wounded woman were horrific," he said.
“The wound disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our TV stations, posters with her picture hung everywhere,” he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the killer's parents, who suspected their son of a heinous crime.
The girl’s mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter’s body had been found.
Rana used to go out and play with the other kids in the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes I went out to see where he was.
We searched everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we searched in vain.
The people of Yemen were disgusted by the crime and began to gather in front of the police station where al-Maghrabi was being held, demanding immediate punishment.
The Justice Department representative read the record of the investigation to the crowd to reassure them.
The accused did not appear to show any remorse for his actions.
Just before the execution, the police read him the sentence, but the convict glanced at his executioner.
The entire event was filmed for national television, but there were many recordings made by the crowd on the Internet.
Governor of West Virginia announces change of political party
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at President Trump’s rally that he was moving to a different party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," Justice said.
“Today, after much prayer and reflection, I am announcing to you... today as a West Virginia resident, I am telling you that I can no longer support you as Democratic Governor.”
The crowd of spectators burst into joy.
"I'll be joining the Republicans tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I can tell you that it's time to jump into another game."
Trump has already promised people at a rally in West Virginia an important announcement.
Trump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
His net worth is estimated at $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, issued a statement Thursday night that said: “Governor Justice’s defection is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is putting obstacles in our way instead of working to uplift our country.”
“For a Democratic party that has only 15 governors and controls the fewest legislatures in history, Governor Justice’s announcement is the last straw for an already destitute, leaderless party that vainly seeks to find a positive and unifying message,” Ronna McDaniel, RNC chairwoman, said in a statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's 'sincere' apology for doping scandal
Former athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for its sincere apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it was not yet the right time for Russia to return to the sports world.
Russian athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF congress – which took place on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics – that expelling his country from the world of sports was the right thing to do and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all the athletes who lost their gold and silver medals in this way.”
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban, which came into effect in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found that Russia had supported the doping of its athletes.
“I think we have seen a very frank response and presentation today,” IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
“All members of the council and Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia admitted its mistake and is working hard to correct and restore the proper function of the entire Federation.”
Coe said he was also “pleased” that Russia had accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
“I think today has been very successful and we have advanced to the next level, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Crisis Staff to maintain the punishment that has been imposed on Russia,” Coe said.
“In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
“Our aim has always been to separate honest athletes from dishonest ones,” he said.
The World Championships in Athletics, which begin in London on Friday, will feature 19 Russian athletes who have met the IAAF’s strict rules.
IAAF chief of staff Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still had to meet several criteria before being allowed back in.
Tests for the presence of drugs are still unsatisfactory and disfellowshipped coaches continue to operate, he told reporters in London after the IAAF board’s presentation.
The state contract CzechTrade was awarded to the company Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Savov, which the state is prosecuting.
The public contract of the state pro-export agency CzechTrade was awarded to the publishing house Mladá fronta Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Savov.
Officials awarded him one hundred percent of the points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state prosecutes Savov for tax fraud and asks for his extradition to the Czech Republic.
In April, the pro-export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the CzechTrade announced a public contract for the four-year provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The contract worth a total of CZK 30.8 million was awarded to Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Savov’s Mladá fronta publishing house.
The Czech police accused him of tax evasion in 2014 and are prosecuting him on the run.
Savov has fled to the UK and the Czech Republic is asking for his extradition.
The case was brought to the attention of the server Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
According to the original criteria, the CzechTrade was to decide on the award of the contract from 60 percent of the price offered and from the remaining 40 beauty contests, i.e. the quality of the project.
And it was Savov’s company that was significantly helped by the latter criterion.
According to the information, Dotyk.cz received one hundred points in all partial quality criteria.
This is what pushed her ahead of the next candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with an amount of CZK 404,900 per month, the VLM offered CZK 324,350.
Unlike the Mladá fronta, however, it received a total of 62 points from the assessors in all qualitative criteria.
The tender was also attended by the consulting firm BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which, like the server Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, is under the publishing house Economia.
VLM submitted several objections to the outcome of the tender, considering its evaluation to be unfair and insufficiently justified.
After their rejection, it was decided to challenge the competition with the Office for the Protection of Competition of the Office for the Protection of Competition.
He believes that CzechTrade acted in violation of the law.
"The applicant is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of the supplier of the public contract on the basis of a purely subjective assessment, clearly favoring the participant Mladá fronta, a.s., at the expense of the applicant and other suppliers," reads the proposal for the opening of the procedure filed with the Office of the Office of the Ombudsman this week, which was published by the server Aktualno.
According to the CEO and Chairman of the Board of VLM Michal Kl<0xC3><0xAD>ma, the selection committee’s scoring seems to be an unreliable and one hundred percent evaluation of the Mladá fronta project by all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Any independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors as unlikely and suspicious," he told the news agency.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
In principle, CzechTrade does not comment on public contracts prior to their conclusion.
All information about the contract mentioned by you is published in accordance with the law in the Contractor’s Profile and in the Public Procurement Bulletin.
"After the completion of the contract, a full written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract we cannot comment on its course," media representative of the agency <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pán Dlouh<0xC3><0xBD> told Dotyk.cz.
The Young Front reacted by saying that it considers it extremely problematic that the publishing house Economia intervened in the competition with an article in Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, where it has its own business interests.
However, this fact was mentioned in that article.
In the tender, she could be helped by the fact that she was the one who provided the BusinessInfo portal with editorial services in the previous four years.
The contract was first awarded in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was headed by Martim Kuba ODS.
Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Savov is accused by the police of tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions of his companies, which caused the Czech state an alleged damage of up to CZK 770 million.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK to extradite him since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the ANO movement Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, whose influence falls under the Mafra publishing house, is behind his criminalization.
Last year, the London court rejected Savov’s appeal against the extradition, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, we have not received any notification from the UK regarding the acquisition of the judgment's legal force," Prague Public Prosecutor's Office spokeswoman <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánka Zenklová told Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
In addition to the ownership of the Young Front, Savov was represented in the Cyprus-based company Harvestor Limited, which controlled the <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice Samson brewery, and in the Cyprus company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund, buying endangered assets.
He should also control the bankrupt company Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes more than three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the withdrawal of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The motorcyclist rode along the sidewalks and through the park, ending up in the moors.
The biker drew attention to himself by driving recklessly along the streets, sidewalks and park paths in <0xC3><0x9A><0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
When the patrol began to pursue him, he decided to drive away in the direction of the Habitat.
"Police officers chased the man with increased caution through the city when he failed to drive on one of the side roads to Mariánské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B> and drove his motorcycle into the field where he crashed," police spokesman Daniel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák said.
In the end, a rescue helicopter had to fly to the accident, which transported the injured motorcyclist to the hospital in Pilsen.
Police later discovered that the motorcyclist did not have a driver’s license, the registration plates on the motorcycle were stolen, his serial number was sharpened, and the production label itself was removed.
It's possible the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
"A breath test was performed to rule out the presence of alcohol in the driver's seat, but the test found a positive result for the substance methamphetamine," a police spokesman said.
How football’s financial rules will affect Neymar’s move to Paris
Rules restricting the funding of European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar’s record move from Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain in France.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be carried out by EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League.
The Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 stipulate that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transfer was not funded without major losses.
Barcelona paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million to buy Neymar out of his contract, and Neymar will demand a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
The following are some of the financial terms of Neymar's transfer to France.
Since the PSG team is funded by a wealthy Qatari family that has grown rich in energy sales, it can afford to bring Neymar into an already stellar football family.
Clubs can spend huge amounts of money on the purchase of players, but on the other hand, they have to prove legitimate sources of income, which allows them to cover the overhead costs of business activities related to football.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini following his appointment as UEFA Director in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that get into debt in pursuit of new reinforcements end up cheating and risking bankruptcy if banks or owners refuse to secure them.
In 2011, FFP’s rules shifted its focus from club debt to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich used with Chelsea in 2003 – to buy a club with potential and spend exorbitant sums on players and build a global brand – was suddenly not as advantageous.
Under the current three-year trial period, which ends in 2018, clubs can report a loss of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, is determined to defend the ban on excessive spending.
“The FFP rules are still in place and we are committed to strengthening them in the future,” Andrea Traverso, who oversees compliance with FFP rules, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid the amount for the redemption of Neymar in a one-off payment, it may, for accounting purposes, spread the amount over the full duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be spread out to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>44.4 million annually for five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions hit PSG along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City in 2014.
PSG has been fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million ($82 million) – which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million – and ordered to reduce the Champions League squad to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is watching out for teams that may try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their revenues through companies affiliated with club owners.
Therefore, even if the Qatari company sponsors PSG as soon as the financing exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the settlement of the amount.
A similar measure was taken by UEFA in 2014 after it decided that the amount of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
A portion of Neymar’s PSG revenue could be paid by the 2022 FIFA World Cup organising committee in Qatar, according to some reports.
However, PSG and World Cup 2022 officials in Qatar have denied that Neymat should become a World Cup ambassador and that such a maneuver would be easily revealed by UEFA officials.
Previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA has not opened an investigation into Neymar’s transfer to PSG.
The source of the report wished to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to comment on the situation with PSG, The Associated Press reported.
The latest published accounts show that PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million and a turnover of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>542.4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club promises to increase turnover by up to 30 percent from signing the contract.
Spanish league officials, apparently concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to thwart Neymar’s departure, arguing that PSG was violating FFP rules.
“This is a clear case of ‘financial doping’ of both the club and the state,” La Liga president Javier Teba told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to PSG’s ownership of the club by a Qatari syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga’s same stance on funding the club.
“This is a consequence of ownership that has fundamentally changed the football world over the last 15 years,” Wenger said in a statement.
“Once you become the owner of the club, anything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult, because the state can have different interests in the participation of such players in their club.
Sparta midfielder Rosick<0xC3><0xBD>: The changes are painful, but we have to believe.
16,000 cheering fans on their feet.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Rosick<0xC3><0xBD> is going to the square.
Same scene as Sunday's game against the Bohemians.
The Spartan midfielder started the game against Crvena Zvezda, invented a few goals, but his teammates did not go into black.
The Latvian team pumped up with new multi-million dollar reinforcements ends after the opening doubles match in the European Cups.
Was it difficult to do anything else after the goal of Belgrade?
After the goal, we had to score four goals, which was difficult for us.
We wanted to at least not lose, to raise our self-esteem so that we had something to bounce back from in the next matches.
We had a chance.
We need to work together as a team and move our game forward.
Why did Sparta not make it to the match for so long?
The game is very elaborate.
The combination of opponents was much better than ours.
We didn't get anywhere, we fired maybe once in half the time.
Of course, this is very little when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, in the final third we managed to play with them.
But you have to push your opponent into such positions more often.
Is there a problem with a large number of layout changes?
Of course, this is one of the pains when a new team is formed.
We have only played three competitive matches and the line-up is still changing.
The idea is for the coach to find the perfect eleven to sit down with.
Are you encouraged that you have already played parts of two matches in a row?
They're still just parts of the game.
I don’t know when I’ll be able to play again and when I’ll be able to play again.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, or we can't do it.
It is the same as an injury.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta has made a decision, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came again in large numbers, but they left in embarrassment.
What can you tell them?
There was a wonderful visit, as well as with Bohemka.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with a better performance.
Show me something that'll make them come back next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don’t remember playing there 15 years ago.
Can a season without cups be at least an advantage for the league?
So far, we are fighting with ourselves, we are playing, so this is not such an advantage for us.
For extreme tax evasion, the entrepreneur is to serve ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected a complaint by businessman Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Toman, who is due to serve ten years in prison for tax cuts.
The estimated damage amounts to CZK 645 million.
In the complaint, Toman claimed that the judiciary violated his fundamental rights, and that the factual findings of the courts in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n and Olomouc were incomplete.
Constitutional judges, however, called the complaint unfounded, found the CTK from the court database.
The U.S. is not another appeals court.
“It cannot, as a fourth instance, assess factual or legal errors allegedly committed by the general courts, unless they constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms,” the resolution reads.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been in force since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouc.
At that time, Toman was in custody in Argentina, where, according to the resolution, he was also in custody at the time of the <0xC3><0x9A>S decision.
The imposed penalty is at the upper limit of the legal rate, which, according to the verdict, corresponds to the damage incurred.
The Supreme Court described the case as an extreme tax evasion, which has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
He served from 2005 to 2008 as Chairman of the Board of World Servis.
<0xC5><0xA0>koda 645 million crowns was created in the period from January to July 2008, the total leak, according to the expert, exceeded a billion.
However, for procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the full amount.
According to the indictment, World Servis did not include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly payments of VAT and excise taxes in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns, taxes were paid in only hundreds of thousands.
World Servis and some of the companies with which the company traded have a relationship with businessman Radom<0xC3><0xAD>r Vyb<0xC3><0xAD>ral, who was fined 13 years in prison for fraud with VAT in fuel trades.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court.
‘Summer for Non-Survival’ and ‘Comrade Detective’ to Play Nostalgic String
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both the characters of the famous 80s; for the dirty 90s (when geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the comedy sketch "The State" on MTV); and, of course, for modern times, specifically 2001, before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, and Paul.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and at the same time the epitome of our modern Facebook era of lasting memories.
From the point of view of the franchise, however, it seems that someone is running out of breath.
The series "First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well - not only thanks to the absurd humor (for example, the story of the emergence of a talking can of vegetables, which was voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors deviated from the main funny point - middle-aged actors who play teenage horny children - and could not make fun of previous events.
The sequel "Ten Years Later", in which adults play adults does not push so much on the emotional plane, and satire is sometimes sporadic, including a parody of the 90s thrillers like "Hand on the Cradle".
At one point, the character finds a pile of Apple Powerbook junk, roller skates, and “a lot of other stuff from 1991.”
Many of the main story lines are repeated.
The kind-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, still hasn’t moved on from his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) being instigated by George H.W. Bush (very well-cast Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise are the many side stories.
Especially fun is to watch the eternally young Rudd with long hair aka Matt Dillon from the movie Youth, whose once respectable character Andy is now an old pepper.
The franchise could be triggered by moments of random madness, such as the return of the “Seven Up” series, until it achieves what I assume will be the logical conclusion: “Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later,” when the entire group will embark on a “Years to Survive” premiere in the final scene.
Meanwhile, Amazon’s “Comrade Detective” appeals to a different type of nostalgia: Cold War revivals of “Such Normal Americans,” “Atomic Blonde: No Regrets,” and even “GLOW,” which pits Eastern and Western wrestling icons against each other.
A comedy by creators Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanac, directed by Rhys Thomas, is to act as a television production: a drama about two Bucharest police officers from Romania in the 1980s who fight for truth and atheism in the manner of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - the tenacious Gregor and the idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulica, who were recruited into the English language by Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a wonderful idea.
Unfortunately, it is not much more.
Some jokes make you laugh (like police officers watching chess on TV - a parody of American football).
The series has been voiced by many well-known actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo<0xC3><0xAB> Sevigny.
But "Comrade Detective" focuses too much on the clumsy propaganda drama - which includes the Reagan masked killer - and so it seems.
Six long episodes are too long and comedic moments are not enough.
In short, the propaganda satire in "Comrade Detective" could work, as in the scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, in whose hall two fat guys are eating burgers stacked on a large pile.
A clear message to an imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgy.
Invented Romanian creators were not mistaken: we do so with our own culture, as well as with theirs.
Russian athletes did not wait for the IAAF ban to be lifted.
The International Athletics Federation (IAAF) at a congress in London confirmed the extension of the international ban on the start of Russian athletes due to the state-supported doping program.
The vote in the World Cup, which starts on Friday, was expected to be very clear.
166 delegates voted to extend the ban, with only 21 votes against.
The main reason for the refusal is primarily the fact that Russia has failed to meet all the requirements for the introduction of an anti-doping system, as the head of the IAAF special investigation group, Rune Andersen, stated before the Congress.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some older doping cases remain unresolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been heard, and trainers with a reputation for scarring are still working in the country.
The Russian Anti-Doping Agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, is not yet fully operational.
However, RUSADA can already conduct testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
“While progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done,” said IAAF President Sebastian Coe.
The Russian athletics federation was suspended in November 2015, and Russian athletes lost, among other things, last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban, the upcoming World Cup will be attended by 19 Russians who have already proven that they have been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for a long time.
However, they will not be able to compete in national colours at the championship and will not be able to play the Russian national anthem if they win.
Bank of England to keep interest rate at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following sluggish economic growth and a weakening of inflation, which has stifled speculation about sharp growth.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "in the background" in the context of maintaining interest rates - despite the squeeze on family budgets.
Political figures from the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted six-to-two to keep the interest rate at 0.25%. The results of the vote to raise the interest rate supported sluggish economic growth supported by weak growth.
In its annual inflation report, the bank forecast growth of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that the decline in family budgets would continue. The bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the Bank indicated that over the next few years there should be growth as a result of inflation caused by Brexit, and also said that rents from movables should increase in financial markets more than expected.
The committee members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package, which was designed to boost the economy and put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result, the Term Funding Plan, which will offer low-cost subsidies to banks, is set to come into force from next February, although the Bank of England has said it will now offer <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion less than the planned <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion.
Just before the decision, the bank said: “MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term along with pressure on real household incomes and a burden on consumption.”
On the subject of rates, the bank said it would need to “tighten the belts of monetary policy” to calm inflation, “to a higher degree” than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting first growth in the third quarter of next year and further growth in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increase would be "slow" and "limited".
The Bank lowered its growth forecast for this year and next year, compared to 1.9% and 1.7% forecasted in May.
The forecast growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained unchanged.
After the publication of the estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.11.
The decision to maintain the status quo came after a disappointing rise buried hopes for further growth - GDP stalled at 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it should increase slightly by the end of the year, the bank said.
The latest report on inflation is a small consolation for households hit by rising inflation and poor wage increases. The bank said that the situation will worsen before the increase.
The report further states that monetary policy “cannot prevent” income cuts in the coming years, but that wages are expected to rise “significantly” towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also grow thanks to the strong interest in British goods due to the weak pound, which will compensate for a lower percentage of consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.025 percent last August in response to a shocking vote on the EU referendum, which caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that a complete unification of prices and the economy will take at least four years.
Before the bank's decision on the latest rates, many demanded an increase in rates, along with rising inflation, which exerted increasing pressure on households. Three political figures demanded an increase to 0.5% in June.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, despite the bank saying it expected such a change and that inflation should pick up again over the next month.
The Bank stated that the excess relative to the 2% target was “completely” due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent drop in swap rates, it looks like competition in the mortgage market will only increase once lenders start competing for orders with a view to a good end-of-year outlook.
The market looks particularly good for those who are ending existing contracts and re-mortgage – there are no-fee options on offer, as well as the low rates they are gaining in popularity.”
NHS prescribes controversial HIV drug to 10,000 patients
Patients will have access to ‘transformative’ HIV prevention treatment starting in September, based on the Supreme Court’s decision to fund the NHS drug.
The National Health Service (NSH) has announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is taken before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through the health service to approximately 10,000 patients within a three-year trial period.
The NSH agreed to fund a trial period after an appeals court upheld a Supreme Court decision last year saying the NHS had the funds to pay for PrEP despite saying the drug should be funded by local authorities.
The decision, which was announced on Thursday, was accepted by the NHS of England through CEO Simon Stevens as a “significant intervention”, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a “decisive moment”.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start accepting patients. Other clinics will join in October and by April 2018 there will be a full implementation across England.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission between at-risk patients.
The application of PrEP before sex means that there is a sufficient amount of specific drugs in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These medications can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
The patients tested included gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and people with HIV-positive partners who were not successfully treated.
Clinics will identify eligible participants who sign consent to participate in testing, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with GP in the UK can also apply to their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The programme will come to taxpayers at <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and NHS England signed a contract this week to distribute medicines after winning an international public contract.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: “This important intervention should complement and fully address the ever-expanding and increasingly successful HIV prevention effort.
It’s another milestone in more than 30 years of trying to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health.”
Deborah Gold, executive director of the NAT (National Aids Trust), said: “We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is administered correctly and patients are at risk, it will offer the opportunity to transform the English HIV epidemic.
Starting in September, NSH will offer patients at high risk of HIV infection a powerful new tool that is individually controlled and not subject to the need to persuade a partner, which will lead to an improvement in the quality of many lives.
We are pleased to accept this statement."
Ian Green, executive director of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The number one priority must be the rapid deployment of tests across the country; we must ensure that it is available to every patient.
We now have a trial drug, PrEP, and we are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.”
Shadow Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: “The start of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Subsequent tests will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
“It is now important that we start testing as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to end the spread of HIV in society.”
Living on a high note: mezzanine and smart design turned this small apartment on Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, swapped a large house in Knightsbridge for an apartment on the Earls Cour in 2014.
Located on the first floor of the Queen Anne smart terrace, it is a showcase of modern design that makes the most of the available space.
“Previously, I lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in Knightsbridge,” Joanne said.
“I was looking for something at a more reasonable price.
I ran into this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same ceiling height.
I immediately fell in love with him, and on the same day I nodded at him.
Since then, the apartment of 1000 square meters has undergone a complete renovation.
One-room apartment with a complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add storage space and mezzanine to take advantage of the high ceiling.
“I wanted a high ceiling, big windows and lots of light.
Those were my demands,” she said.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi from the design and design studio Duck & Shed based in Notting Hill and used the nearly four-meter ceiling to create a home that was not just a project, but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such a height that two gaps could climb above each other - so the challenge for the architects was to create a mezzanine on which one could walk upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
“We had to organize both spaces so that we could walk upright.
It wasn’t just about building a simple platform, but also bending the steel structure to make it at the right height above and below the ceiling.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full-fledged rooms on top of each other - and at the same time add to the drama.
The mezzanine overlooks the beautiful living room of the old copper window frames in the design of Retrouvius.
Mirror furniture in gold color, silver lines and retro chandelier Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor is provided with mirrors on both sides and looks longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to the next room.
At the front door there are storage areas equipped with mirrors to store cutlery and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of a significantly larger space, is the ability to separate it from the kitchen, if it is not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
What is unique about this solution, however, is the folding door.
"We had to solve the technical side," Erfan says of the reinforced veneered doors.
"The door is fitted with counterweights to make it very easy to pull away."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne gained an additional 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes down to it, what you're selling is a living space - or a valuation of your property," Erfan said.
"A real estate agent will, when entering an apartment, calculate its price based on the living space."
In this case, it was possible to increase the living area while maintaining high-quality materials that give the space a luxurious appearance.
“The material is very important because you touch it and you form an emotional bond with the home,” Erfan said.
“You won’t love the electricity in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but they will not win your heart.”
As it turned out, high-quality design and an increase in living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work of art.
And like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States is disengaging.
The cultural and political divide between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has announced a travel ban for its citizens to Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee retaliated and announced a retaliatory ban on the travel of its citizens to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense of the word, US citizens can travel freely throughout all fifty states.
California has banned travel to eight other states, including Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
Who will stop this madness?
California is strongly LGBT and considers any expression of opposition to LGBT lifestyles to be discrimination.
Tennessee passed a law on conscientious objection, according to which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the therapy of LGBT patients is not obliged to provide it to them, but is obliged to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have passed laws under which religious charities that have given babies to mothers after birth for adoption are not required to give them to same-sex couples for adoption.
Due to these conscientious objection laws, California has banned the funding of travel by its citizens to eight states of the Union from its own funds.
In practice, this means that California professors are not allowed to have trips to scientific symposia, for example, in Texas, paid for by their universities, because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
They have to get either federal grants for their travels, but it is absurd for the federal government to finance the trips of citizens from state A to state B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has run out of patience and its parliament passed a law with a resolution that it also does not like California’s policy of high taxes, high government spending, high deficits and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but still does not impose a travel embargo on California because of this.
He's imposing them in retaliation for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
The same shall apply to any State of the Union which imposes a similar travel ban on another State for any reason whatsoever.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
These are the facts, now comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to adopt laws on the reservation of conscience, as well as to decide what their money will go to and what they are not allowed to do.
Secondly, what is wrong with the reservation of conscience?
If a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can't he only offer beef, lamb, poultry, and fish?
Why force him to sell pork under penalty of punishment, when there are enough butchers offering pork?
In Colorado, a baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a heavy fine for refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake Halloween cakes or alcohol-containing cakes.
Why not punish him and leave him alone and order the appropriate cakes from hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust their internal, domestic policy in powers that are not federal, according to their own, i.e. according to the preferences of their inhabitants.
Then there is diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California too!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once legitimately sought tolerance for their lifestyles.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of living and letting live, which should be followed by all reasonable people, but some activists strive not for tolerance towards themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance towards others.
According to them, no one should ever show moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do, they should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are modern-day enemies of freedom.
Fifthly, I do not know of a situation in American history in which states have done so on political grounds, except in the case of one.
Even during the struggle for the civil rights of blacks, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of segregation, the states did not impose sanctions on each other.
The only case was in the 1850s, the political cause was slavery and was bent on the war of the North against the South.
Of course, nothing like this will happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political divide between the blue democratic states and the red republican states is deepening, and the US is mentally disengaging internally.
Unauthorized agitation.
Putin’s critics have been fined.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has been fined 300,000 rubles for violating campaign rules ahead of next year’s presidential election.
The court fined him for calling on people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
Navalny has staged two major anti-government street protests in the past two months and has announced that he wants to run for the post of head of state in March next year.
Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but he is widely expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house this morning and took him to court.
He was fined for urging people to demonstrate through videos posted on the YouTube website.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"We will take them off the judge's salary later," the Kremlin critic joked on Twitter.
The Russian election commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential election because he had previously been convicted of embezzlement.
However, Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, considers the relevant verdict to be politically motivated.
The court on Thursday also fined two members of the Navalny campaign team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Lyaskin, 300,000 rubles and 25,000 rubles respectively.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became the dominant figure on the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend Navalny in the campaign in every possible way.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence for robbing the Kirovles forestry company.
In May, the court of appeal confirmed the verdict.
The verdict is thus final, which prevents Navalny from running under Russian law.
The brothers are fighting for an empire worth more than $500 million.
Now, more than four decades after the founding of the empire by their Italian family, the two brothers are vying for one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth more than $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis resides at Toorak Manor, just three rooms away from his younger brother Paul, who has caught up with a dispute over joint property and commercial assets to the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business as early as 2014, but the bitter dispute is constantly being contested before the Supreme Court.
Together with his mother, Anna, the brothers own a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first store was bought by the family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
It was here that the Westco Jeans family founded the company, which grew into a chain with 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million.
The De Lutis family’s portfolio now includes offices, building land in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and commercial centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one-third of the company’s assets, while his father, Colin, who according to Paul is the “significant driving force and dominant personality” of the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
According to court records, Colin owns $316 million in real estate, while Paul manages $176 million in real estate.
For Paul, it was the distribution of assets and funds that became problematic.
“Colin’s proposal came out in my eyes strongly in his favor,” Paul wrote in a sworn affidavit before the court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first session of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers now also compete over who will control the existing business - from which, according to him, Colin cut off Paul.
Colin counters that this is not true and accuses Paul of mishandling some of the properties.
In a previous affidavit, Colin said he believed in a successful resolution of the conflict.
“My Italian background dictates to me that family is the most important thing,” he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of sworn depositions, emails, and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Keck Cramer are flooding lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and advocates for both sides.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicacies since the 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the 1970s.
They bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco "in his senior year of college, Paul was still a little boy, about 10 years old."
Anna De Lutis said she and Luigi, who died in 2012, had hoped the transfer would go well.
“Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court,” she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family group of companies. Colin stated that Mark was compensated for his departure in the amount of $10 million and Luke in the amount of $26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark “were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation.”
Colin has been holding back ever since, despite the fact that he is a former member of the board of directors of the AFL club, as Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and Colin’s best friend, stated in his 2015 autobiography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin responded only via a text message in which he said that due to the fact that the dispute is being resolved in court, “I have nothing to add.”
“It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to take this matter to court,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin said in a court statement that he was trying to adapt to his brother’s demands.
"Our father would be very unhappy if he saw our current situation," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a successful solution."
On Friday, all hope was in sight.
"Our disputes will be settled in court soon," Colin wrote.
A bucket in the Czech Republic.
The teachers are showering the children.
Public transport drivers pack water and summer clothes.
In kindergarten Na Chodovci in Prague 4, where about 35 children now attend, they only go out in the morning.
The nursery is after reconstruction and planted trees do not provide a big shade yet.
There's no pool, but the teachers' kids are showering in the fog.
In the afternoon, the children stay in the classrooms, where the blinds and curtains are pulled down.
The air is trying to cool the air purifier, because they do not have air conditioning.
It is also difficult for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature inside and outside exceeds the hygienic limits for kindergartens, so we should not even have open operation during this period," said the director of the kindergarten, Miloslava Makovi<0xC4><0x8D>ková.
In the nursery there is a glazed corridor, where, according to her, the temperature is around 40 degrees.
We ventilate in the morning after 6 a.m., the windows close and we have blinds on the south sides to protect ourselves.
"But it won't help much," she added.
They have better conditions in the forest kindergarten Na Hrázi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outside.
We have trees on our property, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful walnut tree, there is a table under it, and we do various things there," described the director of the kindergarten, Barbora Kompanová.
Teachers try to walk with their children in the forest, where there is more coolness.
Children wet hats and on the program have a variety of games with water.
“We have a handheld pressure sprayer that is used to spray flowers, and we use it to shower children,” Kompan said.
Jitka Vilimovska, the director of the kindergarten in Novoborská Street in Prosek, Prague, also said that the teachers are trying to keep the children in the shade and sprinkle them with water.
"We have a fairly grown garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then only after 3 p.m.
Every child should have a head covering.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, a little sweetened tea or diluted juice, and in the garden they have drinks with water.
Every day they also have a vegetable salad to eat and always fresh fruits and vegetables for their snack, which sometimes even their parents bring them.
"Maybe one mother brought a ten-kilo watermelon for the children here today," Makovi<0xC4><0x8D>ková added.
Drivers receive water or summer uniforms.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ion drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
In most cases, the cabs of tram and bus drivers are air-conditioned, DPP spokeswoman Aneta <0xC5><0x98>ehková said.
In addition to the cabins, some trams are also air-conditioned in the passenger compartment.
The high-temperature tram tracks have not yet seriously damaged.
Minor damage occurred in a loop in Hostiva<0xC5><0x99>.
At the current high temperatures, we make sure that drivers have a sufficient amount of drinks available.
"Cold drinking water is available in all loops, alternating points and carriageways," <0xC5><0x98>ehková said.
In the carriageways and at some changing places, employees have at their disposal so-called modernists who produce chilled soda.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ionic drinks.
“They can also take advantage of a summer uniform, which increases the comfort of drivers during their daily shifts,” she added.
The hot and dry weather of recent days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters across the Czech Republic eliminated 108 of them, double the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday during the day, when temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed over 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters mainly engaged in the fight against fire.
"Fires in the natural environment, as well as those associated with harvest work, predominate," firefighters spokeswoman Nicole Zaoralová said.
Even the evening weather change did not bring relief to the firefighters, when storms and torrential rains replaced the heat in a number of places.
In connection with the storms, firefighters went to 236 interventions.
It was mainly about the removal of fallen trees and branches.
"They intervened the most in the Central Bohemian Region," Zaoralová continues.
However, firefighters were also needed in Stvol<0xC3><0xAD>nky in <0xC4><0x8C>eskolipsko, where they evacuated 60 people from the children’s camp to safety due to the storm.
Tropical temperatures have also added to the work of Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and Wednesday night, ambulances were dispatched to dozens of cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from carbs.
People should therefore have their water heaters checked, rescuers warn.
Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that is released during imperfect combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling faint.
In case of suspected poisoning, it is necessary to leave the infected room.
Trump's New Chief of Staff Plans to Reduce President's Media Diet
Many have tried before him and have always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico said the new White House chief of staff plans to limit President Trump’s flow of information — including reports on television news reports — in hopes of keeping Trump afloat.
Here's part of reporter Josh Dawson's report:
“When the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, met with staff on his first day in office, he outlined a key problem for the Trump White House that he intends to fix: incorrect information that is getting into the president’s hands.
Kelly told employees that he had to personally approve all information — whether on paper or by word of mouth — because the president could make better decisions based on the right information.
Kelly’s diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors broke their teeth at Trump’s control and media coverage.
Trump’s relationship with the media goes back decades — and now that he’s sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
“If Trump, as a candidate, was upset by honest reporting, it was appropriate for him to show that he was being talked about in a positive light by a lot of other media, which was easier to convince,” Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmer of Politico wrote at the time that “the key to keeping Trump’s tweets in check — at least according to six former campaign organizers — is to ensure that Trump regularly follows the media that sings his praises.”
Okay, okay.
But the idea that Trump’s tendency to post his views on Twitter was ever “under control” is ludicrous.
Perhaps these campaign organizers know something that others don’t – that Trump’s tweets would be more inflammatory if someone didn’t control them.
The tweets that Trump never sent will most likely never be known.
If his employees managed to keep him at least a few times in check, then their efforts did not go to waste.
However, no one has been able to regularly prevent Trump from inciting controversial topics.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which is made up of rival factions, people regularly seek to strengthen their agenda by pushing through materials — which may or may not be reliable — that support their worldview.
The Politico portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report in May on the tendency of advisers to present dubious information to the head of state.
Here’s an example from reporter Shane Goldmancher:
Current and former Trump officials say the president often reacts very angrily to negative media reports, especially leaks, and seeks to find their origin.
This situation occurred at the end of February, when someone planted a copy of an article from GotNews.com—the website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson—who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being “a source of many leaks” from the White House.
Regardless of the fact that Johnson was forever banned from Twitter for harassment; or that he didn’t substantiate his claim with any evidence; or that he had already posted false accusations in the past and later retracted them.
Trump read the article and started asking questions about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter “tried to implement a system to manage and document the information that President Trump receives.”
Would it work?
Now, three months later, Kelly is trying to push through the same strategy.
He may turn out to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump’s impulsivity will not go away and his aides are still competing for power.
These invariable factors will certainly make Kelly's mission more difficult.
Tourists negotiate ditch and return to ‘Millionaire’s Quarter’
Several of the UK’s most active homeowners in West Midland are once again at odds with determined tourists who are negotiating with local authorities about the right to re-acquire the land for their estates.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field on a flourishing street in the town of Solihull, nicknamed the “million-dollar neighborhood.”
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, tourists return after they were banished in May. They were not afraid of even the moat, which was dug on the spot on the basis of the orders of the authorities in order to prevent their invasion.
The tact group found gaps in the defense and penetrated into the field with caravans unprotected gap, which served as a road.
Angry residents of the neighborhood attacked the Solihull city council, saying they were “not able to solve the problem.”
One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ‘They occupied the place on Monday night after being moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones at other people.
The Board of Directors should be ashamed of its inability to resolve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they are back.
Another arrived last night, and more are likely to arrive today.'
She added: “The Birmingham Board of Governors knows how to deal with this problem, and they use court orders to protect the parks.
I live in Streetsbrook, and I don't intend to pay any more taxes until the board of directors has dealt with the tourists."
Another anonymous resident said: ‘It’s ridiculous, we just recently followed the last departing tourists and now they’re back.
And this time there were even more, and this time they brought horses with them.'
A Solihull City Council spokesman said: “We are aware of the unauthorized stay on the property near Streetsbrook Road and are working with local police to take the necessary legal steps to successfully resolve the matter.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many local residents as possible report any unsocial or illegal behaviour to the police at 101.
This will give us the full picture that we will present in court.'
The wife of the MEP was hit by a car in Brussels.
It was brought in by a government special.
A government specialist transported the wounded R<0xC3><0xB3>bert <0xC5><0xBD>it<0xC5><0x88>ansk<0xC3><0xBD> to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and the plane was under constant control of Slovak doctors.
The long-planned flight went without complications.
R<0xC3><0xB3>bert <0xC5><0xBD>it<0xC5><0x88>ansk<0xC3><0xBD> had a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of the summer, according to TV JOJ.
He was hit by a car and has been in serious condition ever since.
After his transfer to his homeland, he was transported to a specialized workplace of one of the Bratislava hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of Slovak MEP Jana <0xC5><0xBD>it<0xC5><0x88>anská from the NOVA party.
She did not want to comment on the incident.
The couple has three children together.
Italians confirm in fight against rescue ships of NGOs with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will stop the arrival of NGO rescue ships arriving off the coast of Italy with migrants from the Mediterranean unless the NGO signs new rules regulating their operations.
“If the NGO does not sign the new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue their operations,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti’s warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a German rescue ship, the Jugend Rettet, on suspicion of human trafficking, making illegal immigration much easier.
The first-year rescue organization declined to comment on the matter because of allegations by Italian state prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosios.
“For us, saving lives is and always will be our number one priority, so we are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the rescue zones,” the organization said in a statement on social media.
“We can only comment on all current allegations after gathering all the information and evaluating the whole situation.”
Italian authorities have been monitoring the Juventa vessel, the Jugend Rettet, since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting immigrants on board, which were handed over to them directly by human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting took place, according to the prosecutor's file, allegedly only 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya.
The crew of the ship is suspected of breaking the law and bypassing the Italian coast guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area - out of humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as the Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta’s MOAS and Spain’s Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The organization said on Thursday that the new rules are not necessary but acceptable because they do not represent a “substantial change or obstacle” to rescue operations.
Doctors Without Borders (MSF), the Nobel Prize-winning organization, has also rejected the new code of conduct.
Minniti, meanwhile, said a sharp decline in recent weeks in migrants landing in Italy as part of rescue operations suggests that efforts to boost patrols off the coast of Libya and co-operation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
“In recent days, we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel,” he said.
He also revealed plans for further talks this month with Libya's mayors on an economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Shameless Mesaro<0xC5><0xA1>ová: Silicone and cellulite crawled out of her overal!
The hot summer days completely entice you to wear only the most necessary things that will cover the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesaro<0xC5><0xA1>ová does the opposite.
At an afternoon meeting at the Prague Zoo, where actors, presenters, singers and everyone involved with TV Prima was just swarming, she wrapped her body in a mini overall.
And just a few ordinary movements were enough, and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her buttocks.
Overal had cut her in half many times, and she had gotten so high that she had to edit it all the time.
There was no need for the attention of the gentlemen and the photographers present.
Michelle Carter Convicted of Sending Text Messages Inciting Conrad Roy to Commit Suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two years in prison for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter is serving 15 months of a two-year prison sentence and then spending five years on parole.
Carter was convicted in June of unintentionally killing Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father told the court on Thursday: “The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was left free until a decision was made.
She was facing up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy were mentally ill.
Dressed in red trousers and a creamy blouse, Carter stood in the judgment seat with tears in her eyes, her hands clasped, and her eyes pointing to the ground.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the judge.
"She ended his life to relieve herself.
She could not accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She showed no remorse."
Carter’s attorney, however, said it was “unfortunate circumstances that I deeply regret.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that "her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder does not have a significant impact on her performance."
The plaintiff read a statement from Roy’s mother, Lynn Roy, saying: “There will not be a single day that goes by that I do not mourn the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me – I care for his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain we will carry with us forever.”
Roy’s sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was being “harassed” by the knowledge that she would never attend her brother’s wedding and would never be the aunt of his children.
“The loss of the person I’ve been seeing since I was born is a pain I will carry with me for life,” she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a law in force that would penalize a person who is aiding and abetting the suicide of another person, so this case sets a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in 2014 in a car seat, poisoned by carbon dioxide.
The case caught the attention of the entire nation after Carter’s suicide-inciting text messages were published.
“Hang yourself, jump out of the building, or stab yourself, I don’t care,” Carter wrote in a text message sent just two weeks before his death, while Roy was on family vacation.
A few minutes before her suicide, she wrote to him, “You have to do it, Conrad,” and “You just have to put on a generator and you’ll be free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said Carter had longed for attention through Roy’s death and ordered her to refrain from any comments in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who sided with Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007.
Ms. Knox, 30, wrote in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not jail.”
Audi will modify up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to a sharp response
Just a day before the announcement, Audi carmaker BMW said it would offer its customers a software update in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes there are “more intelligent options than driving restrictions” in response to European cities – including Munich, which is BMW’s headquarters – considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have largely promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to comply with the regulations on carbon dioxide emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide, which is released by diesel engines, is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in the cost of car manufacturers to install devices to neutralize gases emitted by diesel engines, which makes it difficult for cars to compete.
While German carmakers are facing scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing accusations of spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which in an attempt to meet emission limits installed software in their cars, which during testing reduced the amount of emissions issued, but under normal conditions the software was deactivated.
Several senior Volkswagen officials have been indicted in the United States and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics at Audi’s engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo’s former manager Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality and is not subject to extradition, so he could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi became involved in a criminal investigation by German police into Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system that was supposed to bypass European emission limits — and expanded the charges Audi faces in the US.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation could have an adverse impact on Volkswagen: the luxury carmaker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profits.
The plane landed on the beach in an emergency.
A man and a girl died.
The accident occurred on the beach of Praia de S<0xC3><0xA3>o Jo<0xC3><0xA3>o in the Costa da Caparica area, about 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses told the SIC television channel Noticias that the plane was flying just above people sunbathing on the beach before landing.
Some people from the beach allegedly fled from the danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people did not manage to escape from the machine.
According to local media, a 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl were killed on the beach.
“The plane hit them and they were dead on the spot,” said Pedro Coelho Dias, a police chief.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both of whom escaped from the accident alive, and the police took them for questioning.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
Are the highways in the Czech Republic complete?
I'll give you a riddle.
It is unfinished, although it began to be built as early as 1978.
Even if it is unfinished, it is constantly being repaired.
And it can't be built any further, even if it has a building permit.
What's that?
Yes, the Hradec Králové highway D11.
The construction of another section of it was stopped by the Children of the Earth movement for at least a few months.
We easterners get the highway bit by bit, like sliced salami.
They cut the wheel and then we'll see when and if we get another one.
We don’t want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the driving time and we want to get trucks going to or from Poland from villages and cities.
Endless streams of trucks go straight through the city of Jarom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99> or Náchod, which is not a reasonable way around.
But so far, the last section of our dream highway was put into operation in 2008, that is, an incredible nine years ago.
Not a knock since then.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometers of the unfinished section to Hradec Králové and other sections to Jarom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99> were recently built, archaeological research began with the fact that the construction will begin at the end of this year, you could hear the loud banging of the studs in Eastern Bohemia.
No one believed it anymore.
Last week it turned out that it will not be built this year.
And maybe not next year.
The movement Children of the Earth-Club for Sustainable Transport from Brno has filed for dissolution.
The children of Earth repeat their tactics from D1.
The decision on the building permit was attacked in its entirety.
In the breakdown, they request a review of all binding opinions already issued by all the authorities concerned.
For example, the Hradec Magistrate, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Office.
In the meantime, we descend from D11 near the village with the eloquent name Poh<0xC5><0x99>eba<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
So we go down, we just drive down the highway, and suddenly we stand on the next road and we prefer to subsequently join the column.
The worst thing is that you see similar stories all over the country.
Terrible, constantly clogged road to Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ov, highway D1 or D8.
Everyone has a funeral.
What do the children of the earth want?
What is the nature of the problems of road construction in the Czech Republic?
And why is the highway network virtually inconclusive in the current system?
Read on for a new reflection.
Lavender from Provence is threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in the region of southeastern France, but now they are threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining as a result of dry climates and harmful insects, causing havoc on the faces of researchers and farmers looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: “The cultivation of lavender in Provence is at risk, because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings with it less rainfall in the spring and autumn.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
Cicadas and locusts carrying micro-bacteria, which thrive in dry climates, are also to blame.”
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists, and the oil that is made from it is an important ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants grow.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavenders is, of course, smaller."
A possible solution may be to distribute water more efficiently and slow the evaporation of water from the soil, but also to spray lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and to breed more species resistant to dry weather.
Journalist's murder highlights growing threats in Mexico
Riodoce staff meet regularly on Wednesdays to discuss news of the ongoing unrest in the Sinaloa region, involving organised criminals, corrupt officials and relentless drug wars.
Today, however, under the onslaught of recent events, they meet mainly for their own safety.
They learn that it is important to change their habits.
Two well-deserved journalists talk about what would be safer: taking their children with them to an office that was attacked with a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: adversaries, neutrals, and allies.
They will ask journalists to provide names for each word - no evidence is needed, just use imagination and foresight.
To choose them from - drug dealers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspected of taking money from the government or drug cartels - a catalog of criminals whose job is to cover up criminal acts.
Violence continues and bodies pile up across the country; journalists are on the rise: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, there have been at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto came to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven have been killed in all seven states this year.
Among them is co-founder of Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on the violence associated with the drug trade.
His loss is palpable, though his presence is all-pervasive - a large photograph of Valdez with the inscription "Justice", to which the middle finger points, hangs in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years old, have a T-shirt with a photo of Valdez with a smile on his face, glasses on his nose.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the fact that a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists' cases, so far, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, it has sued two suspects.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur each year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, and journalists' killers go on trial very rarely.
Riodoca journalists insist on reporting on the violence that is taking place in Sinaloa; even though they are devastated and the territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about the killers and without a vision of justice, the security meeting is pointless, says Ibarra.
"It is foolish to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, you can't trust anyone."
On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left Riodoc headquarters in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloa.
He managed to drive a few blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 bullets, apparently because of the name of the article - which can be translated as Twelfth River.
The gunmen then boarded his car and crashed it not far from the scene of the crime.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors seem to be spreading fast in Culiacan.
In Valdez's case, however, there is a suspicious silence.
Since Guzman’s arrest last year and his January release to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country’s bloodiest battlefields as rival factions try to fill the void.
Every day, several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloa, and the cemetery is full of jeweled two-story mausoleums for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word “ceasefire” means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes through which drugs travel to the United States.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately familiar with the risks of his job, Ismail Bojorquez (60), the co-founder and director of Riodoc, still nullifies the fact that he did not protect his friend.
He believes that two errors contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war on the sons of Joaqu<0xC3><0xAD>n Guzmán.
Peace might have angered the sons; the suspected gang members had bought all the copies of the newspaper as soon as they landed on the counters.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of other newspapers in which the same story had been printed.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as an important milestone in the fight of Mexican criminals against journalists.
He had managed to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed it would never change.
He was practically a veteran of the Noroeste magazine when he decided in 2003 to sell his $50 stock and found Riodoc together with five colleagues.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to run a newspaper without mentioning the drug trade,” Bojorquez said.
Riodoc eventually gained a good reputation for brave and truthful reporting; the newspapers began to prosper.
Journalists liked to search for problematic topics and publish uncensored texts - readers were fascinated to read stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoc won the prestigious Maria Moores Cabot Award for its coverage of Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the Committee to Protect Journalists’ International Press Freedom Award for his courageous reporting on the Mexican drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I was afraid for my life," he said as he accepted the award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is a “way of life,” Valdez told Rompeviento TV in October last year.
"You have to take on the role of a journalist - or play the fool.
I don’t want anyone to ask me, ‘What were you doing in the face of death... why didn’t you tell me what was going on?’”
The staff of Riodoc misses Valdez. The man was known for his wit and choosy language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar opposite the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: did this routine cause his death?
His death also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job best and stay alive?
"They don't like you messing with their wives, their kids, their clean stores, their secret landing areas."
"These things were forbidden," said Bojorquez.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel that something is not working here, hands off.
The problem is, Riodoc editor Andres Villarreal said, “smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the Javier thing happened.”
The old rules, he said, no longer apply in Sinaloa – as they do in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No cell phones are allowed in the room where Riodoc employees meet; a few days ago, spyware was discovered that was bought by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two police officers find relief from the 40-degree heat in the shade of a nearby tree.
They were selected by the state to protect the Riodoc offices, which are located in a four-story building in the burghers' district of Culiacan.
Journalists joke about whether these police officers belong to the 50 percent of the defenders of the law who, according to the government, are corrupt.
It has been several months since journalists last ventured into the mountainous areas that essentially control drug cartels.
There are three main stories on this week’s program.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Chávez in Sinaloa.
They also pay tribute to suspicious government spending that took place in the governor’s hometown.
Recently, there have also been several kidnappings at one of Culiacan’s most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the prosecutor’s office.
Officially, no one announced the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the abduction, so journalists were on the alert when they were about to write about what every resident of the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite destination for drug dealers and politicians.
One journalist read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name associated with a certain politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of the political scene for almost the entire last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of high-level corruption.
Villarreal asked reporters to report on previous incidents at the restaurant, including one in which one of Joaqu<0xC3><0xAD>n "El Chapo" Guzmán's sons escaped from an army intervention unit.
A month ago, readers would have read about it in Valdez's column, which was the best source of information on kidnappings.
“Valdez would certainly solve the case,” said Villarreal, 46, who is nicknamed “El Flaco” for his slim figure.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office turned into a warehouse of signs and stickers to protest against the killing of journalists. Employees certainly did not expect them to become activists on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and went out the next morning to demonstrate outside the prosecutor’s office for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez’s murder in the western part of the state of Michoacán.
Only a charred body was found, and authorities say it was Adamea based on DNA analysis.
The activity of journalists is increasing all over the country. Many of them are organizing protests and scribbling on the sidewalks and buildings of the "SOS press".
The director of the newspaper, Bojorquez, is on a day-long visit to Washington, D.C., where he seeks international support and justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after Valdez’s murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and murdering them for telling the truth.
In the meantime, she asked to be transferred to another department for fear that her anger might jeopardize her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are “behind the scenes” of organized crime, corrupt officials and an indifferent public.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that journalists die not only at the hands of drug cartels, but also at the behest of politicians and security forces who cooperate with organized crime.
Media watchdog group Articulo 19 has blamed more than half of all attacks on journalists on police officers and public officials.
"You die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez said.
The murders are clearly working.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Mac<0xC3><0xAD>as, which occurred six years ago near the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note reportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “This is how I ended up with my messages.”
Next to the severed head lay a keyboard and headphones.
Some branches have decided to shut down operations, such as the newspaper El Norte, based on the northern border of the state of Chihuahua, in response to the March murder of rapporteur Miroslava Breach.
Others continue to do so, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after killing its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with an article on the front page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across borders.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as well as getting rid of the feeling that someone is constantly chasing you.
And journalists are being persecuted and killed, as in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their work, it poses a great risk every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
“Mexico is going to hell, that’s why I became a journalist,” he said.
It's midnight on Friday, and Riodoc's employees are sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office -- the latest issue sent to the printer -- sipping a beer when the phone rings.
They learn that 19 people were killed in a shootout between gang members and police officers near a beach resort in Mazatlan.
The war is escalating, just as many of the messages left in this area by syndicate members have promised.
Journalists publish this news from a mobile phone on the Riodoc website.
Not a day goes by and the headline changes again.
The sounds of police sirens indicate another firefight.
Bojorquez takes a quick look at the police patrol to see if they're paying attention.
If they're scared, they don't show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodical - whose middle finger is the eloquent slogan for the entire Sinaloa - all Riodoc employees follow in his footsteps.
"How can we think of leaving," said Bojorquez, "when, on the same day that Javier was killed, an internist asked me to send her out into the streets?"
Dinosaurs Used Camouflage to Avoid Enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, scary as it is.
Researchers have now uncovered the findings of the first findings of an amazing creature the size of a rhino, whose perfectly preserved remains – which experts have dubbed the ‘Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs’ – were found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such a high degree that experts were able to determine the reddish-brown color of his scaly skin, and reported that the dinosaur had a “problematic past.”
An article in Current Biology called it “the best-preserved armoured dinosaur yet found and one of the best dinosaur species in the world.”
The fossil is a new species of the family Nodosauridae. The dinosaur lived in the Cretaceous period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His well-preserved condition literally shocked researchers, who described him as “really remarkable.”
According to National Geographic, the armoured bivalve is the best-preserved fossil of its kind to date.
The discovery was made by Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling in the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He came across something that looked like a foreign object and decided to examine it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working to uncover the animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1,100 kg.
After the work is completed, the dinosaur is ready to be discovered.
‘Just close your eyes a little and you’ll believe you’re sleeping,’ said lead author Caleb Brown and a naturalist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is displayed.
"It will certainly go down in history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur species - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
By studying his skin, the researchers found that this herbivorous - despite being covered in armor and resembling a walking tank - was likely facing a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a cloaking system that many modern animals use.
Experts say that this allowed him to better blend in with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The camouflage system suggests that he was a favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
Reports of a 110-million-year-old dinosaur of the Nodosauridae family first appeared in a newspaper in May. It is currently available for viewing at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, who along with the team spent more than 7,000 hours meticulously uncovering the fossil.
Thanks to the remarkably preserved state of the fossil, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the patterns and shape of scales and armor all over the body.
They discovered a method of masking commonly used by today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, the researchers’ findings are surprising because Borealopelta’s size far exceeds that of today’s animals using the same technique.
So it is possible that the dinosaur was so many predators that evolution preferred masking to confrontation in survival.
Many of today's camouflaged animals - such as deer, zebras, and stragglers - are much smaller and also more vulnerable than prey, suggesting that the nosodaurus had to literally fight for its survivors.
“The transmission of a huge and heavily armored dinosaur illustrates the dangers posed by predators during the Cretaceous period,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic components contained in the scales also revealed that the dinosaur skin was likely reddish-brown in color.
The researchers continue to study the animal and look for further clues about its life, including the preserved contents of its stomach, to find out its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river after death and was taken to the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
Alberta at the time had the same climate as Florida today, and the rivers and oceans stretched much farther inland than they do today.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin and at the same time is preserved in three dimensions so we can see its original size,” Brown said.
“For these reasons, the animal looks practically the same as it did during the Cretaceous period.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; you just need to close your eyes a little and it seems like you're just sleeping.'
During the Cretaceous period, huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, walked the Earth on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could have been the favorite prey of his equally fearsome ancestors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, an 11.5-meter-long monster weighing over 6 tons.
The researchers, whose latest findings were published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelt’s body was washed into the sea after being mummified in the mud.
The discovery was made by Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling in a Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, this is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, which is also complete from the snout to the hip.
The animal reached an average length of 5 meters and weighed up to 1300 kg.
Two 50-centimetre spikes protruded from his shoulders.
Researchers believe this herbivore roamed the territory of present-day Canada until it ended up in a river that washed it into the sea.
His underwater tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
Fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armoured plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic, “Finding a person that survives can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I follow him, the more shocking the find seems to me.
Fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armoured plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
At his side lies his right forefoot with his fingers pointing upwards.
I can easily count the scales on his feet.'
How did one activist find out the answer to the question: ‘Whose Streets?’
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shuddered all over her body.
The day after she arrived in New York, a native of St. Louis sat on her bed in an Airbnb room and browsed Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across the contribution of a high school student.
"Police have just shot and killed an 18-year-old man whose body is still lying in the street," it said.
She was surprised that no one else had written this post for her, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
<0x40>TheePharoah constantly retweeted her wall posts.
The St. Louis rapper tweeted about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old man shot dead by a white-skinned police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's body lying limp on the street, where no one had taken him after four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put down her phone to go back to it the night she watched tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed to be the father of the victim and held a sign in his hand that read "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son"!
She watched the live news - one of the policemen was standing in front of a group of protesters, holding a leash and a barking dog at the other end.
In another video, another police officer, she said, held a gun in his hand with which he aimed at the crowd and shouted, “I’m going to kill you all... animals.”
"That's not normal," Ferrell said to herself.
"This is not the type of murder we are used to and can call normal.
I could feel goose bumps all over my body.
"I was angry and I was crying."
She immediately booked a return flight and traveled home the next day.
After landing at 23:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to head to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years is described in a new documentary, Whose Streets?, which will be released on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and resistance, strength and resilience told from the point of view of the people living in the community, who take to the streets and demand answers.
On her way to Ferguson, Ferrell introduced a dialogue with her daughter – dressed in a floral dress and the same floral headband – about a topic they had discussed many times before – “about the experience with black people.”
"Remember when I taught you how black people had to fight for what they believed in?" he recalls.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"There was no way I wouldn't take her with me," Ferrell later said.
“Today’s events are a climax... that happened in the past.
She had to know it and see it with her own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organizing, but also to learn the difference between the different layers of black experience and what we have to do to liberate ourselves.
Although I am able to provide her with conditions in which she will not experience racism on her own, she is in no way different from another black child-woman.
I feel that if I had protected her from this experience, I would have only hurt her.”
Upon arrival in Ferguson, South Florissant Road was the first stop across the street from the police department, which became the base of activists who were waiting for the words of police officer Darren Wilson about his possible participation in the incident.
Here Ferrell and his daughter met a local businessman who was preparing food for others.
Together, they prepared food in bags and helped distribute it to Protestants.
In Ferrell's eyes, a new type of activism was slowly emerging.
“My activism turned upside down after August 9th,” Ferrell said, adding that while studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of Minority Student Nurses Assn. and sought to introduce health care and food to black communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, Ferrell met the later co-director of the documentary, Sabaah Folayan, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "just document" the ongoing events.
But Ferrell thought, “Are you working on a documentary or are you trying to find a story to use?”
This type of skepticism penetrated the community through many people, often whites, who wanted to make money on pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in an interview: “We heard that the voices of people who are born and raised in Ferguson are very often overlooked, and that’s what we wanted to change.”
Folayan has already established a collaboration with co-director Damon Davis, who is a respected local artist who deals with the topic of prisoners on death row.
His participation in the project also intrigued Ferrell and, along with six other locals, who were followed by the Whose Streets? team in the years following Brown's murder.
"No one speaks for us in this document, but it is our statement," Davis said.
"It was important to me - how these people will be represented - because I will be represented the same way."
While the aim of the documentary was not to focus on Ferrell’s experiences – in an effort to show that the movement “is not about a rescue leader, but about bringing the community closer together,” Folayan said – it turned out that she was the one most open to participating in the filming.
The documentary “Whose Streets?” thus describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell’s life, such as how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said with a smile on her face as she thought of the first moment she saw the final version of the document.
"But I understood that in order to do this job and humanize black people, I had to open up."
Ferrell’s story also highlights the role of the eccentric black woman in the broader aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement – who created the #BlackLivesMatter campaign on social media in response to the 2012 murder of teenager Trayvon Martin – call themselves freaks.
“Black eccentric women in leadership positions are ultimately worth preserving the movement,” Ferrell said, “because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must bear the brunt of these events.”
Folayan agrees with this statement, adding that "the movement is actually supported by black women and a large number of eccentric black women."
However, she insists that "this is not just an affirmative matter" and Ferrell is not the main heroine of the documentary because of her views.
"She was the driving force and the source of energy," she said.
"that she was in the front lines is no coincidence, for life at these crossroads in the skin of a black woman is dangerous.
You can feel the energy in front of the screen.”
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, television cameras have cleared their positions, but severe racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell is serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence for blocking a highway during demonstrations.
She described the social and political atmosphere in the area she calls home as "a mess."
Still, she hasn’t stopped trying, which she’s committed to since she hit the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our chains.”
A field was burning in Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters came to the scene, and a helicopter helped.
Near <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Brod in the Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n region, between the villages of Bylany and Liblice, a field of about 15 hectares was burning from 14:00.
The fire ceased to spread around 15:15, firefighters declared a third stage of fire alarm out of four possible.
According to Ladislav Holom<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>k, a spokesman for firefighters, the helicopter also helped to extinguish the fire from the air.
At 18:00 firefighters managed to extinguish the fire, the fire caused damage for 700000 crowns.
Dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters fought the flames on the spot.
The fire was caused by a technical fault in the engine compartment of the combine harvester.
Hasit was also assisted by a helicopter, which made a total of six drops of water.
"We have handed over the site to the owner, and until tomorrow at 8:00 a.m. it will be guarded by a unit of volunteer firefighters," Holom<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>k said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: Artist Creates Portraits Using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of one of the rooms of the New York Fridman Gallery, there are several faces of different shades of skin - white, black and brown - suspended from the ceiling on the wires. Each of them seems to fall out of the eye of the previous one.
All 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from mouth and hair swabs sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for unauthorized publication of secret cables on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which began on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her experience in technology, computer science and the arts, and Manning, a transgender and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Obama three days before she left office.
By algorithmically analyzing Manning’s DNA and using 30 portraits to illustrate what a person with this genotype would look like, Dewey-Hagborg has created a sharp, if not intellectual commentary on DNA’s malleability – as well as the many ways DNA can be interpreted – and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, as well as the inherent identity of these interpretations.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including violating six spying laws, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photos were taken by the prison staff, and only one low-quality black-and-white photo was leaked to the public, on which Manning, visibly alarmed, sits in the driver's seat in the platinum blonde wig she is now associated with.
In 2015, there were still positive reactions to the 2012 Dewey-Hagborg project Stranger Visions.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create an image of the possible forms of these people.
It was at this time that she received an email from Paper Magazine.
“They were going to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and they wanted to add a portrait to the article,” Dewey-Hagborg said at the opening of the new exhibition.
However, neither visiting nor photographing were allowed, so they turned to Chelsea to ask if she would be interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became friends over the course of two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, which presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea were pardoned and could attend the show in person.
In fact, President Obama asked for Manning’s release a few days after the comic’s release, a welcome change after several unbearable years in a military prison in Kansas.
Interestingly enough, the show comes at a time when Donald Trump is waging war on people who seek to expose government information and transgender soldiers while trying to find new ways to use his tweets to incite resentment in areas he should be supporting.
In response to a question about this special timing, Dewey-Hagborg said that “everything happens for a reason.”
Under the artist’s statement on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls with her huge signature (the letter “i” in the surname is punctuated by the heart) after the end of “self-acting factionalism based on gender, race, sexuality and culture.”
On the opposite side are the sequences of its mitochondrial DNA - the centipedes of the letters C, G and A recorded in pencil.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist’s sophisticated scientific dictionary), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we all are.
“I hope that people get away with it, that our genome doesn’t care about who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and anyone can interpret it in their own way,” Dewey-Hagborg said.
"DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last example of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is a single page from the above graphic novel.
It depicts Manning emerging in the manner of King Kong from the United States Prison Discipline Barracks with a megaphone in her hand.
“As soon as they stop you from speaking, they win,” it says.
"Never be silenced."
"It's a direct transcript from one of the letters," the Philadelphia artist said.
"When I think about it, I get goose bumps."
Manning has not yet visited the exhibition in person - as predicted in the comic - but when she does, she will be greeted in the middle of the room with her masks, her own genomic images, arranged like a crowd of Protestants.
Which was also the purpose of the exhibition, including the almost 160 cm high statue of Maning, on which her genetic haplogroups are recorded in pencil.
“In the past, they were placed on walls, but this time I wanted to make them feel like a crowd,” Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted to give the impression of a mass movement that takes the form of Chelsea and liberates her."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
A professor at Northwestern University and staff at Oxford University are being prosecuted for the murder of a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, a first-degree murder warrant was issued for a man named Wyndham Lathe, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged complicity in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to Cook County court records.
The document states that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died from several stab wounds.
Chicago police said the body was found on July 27.
Upon arrival at the Grand Plaza Apartments, the victim was found in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau has been pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the case as a homicide, while police are searching for both suspects, authorities said.
Lathem has been a professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university’s vice president of public relations, said in an email statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering the university’s school premises.
“The whole matter is now being investigated by the relevant authorities and the Northwestern University is fully cooperating with them,” Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial administrator at Oxford University.
A university and Somerville College spokesman said in an emailed statement: “We have been contacted by British police and are ready to assist the US police as well.”
The statement also said that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wished him to report to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of public relations at the Chicago Police Department, said he was urging suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"Police have information on their whereabouts and efforts to track down the suspects are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities were assisting police in the search for the suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a phone call from the Grand Plaza building manager, who was alerted to the events that were to take place in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lathe and Warren had been caught by security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza issued a statement to all residents: “Police are now working to compile a timeline and profile of the victim and are investigating various motives, including domestic violence.”
“In the near future, we will complete the WADA plan” – Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it would not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"Part of the criteria for the new plan have now been completed and RUSADA has already obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this fact, the WADA plan has been updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of WADA’s compliance plan – which describes the criteria for RUSADA’s renewal – which was recently published on the organisation’s website.
According to Mutko, the code does not contain anything that Russia should be concerned about.
“Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be made available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future.”
One of the criteria, however, calls for a public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation, which was investigated by Richard McLaren, about the alleged sponsorship of Russian athletes by the government.
Mutko said: “We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has clearly failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs in our country, and so we can’t admit to something that never existed.”
Vitaly Smirnov, Director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission, confirmed Mutko’s words.
In an interview with Russia’s RSport, Smirnov acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping officials, but added: “On many occasions, we have stated that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report completely without reservations," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADA of carrying out doping controls within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organization allowed the planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this June.
Following a visit to the organization’s Moscow headquarters in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was “on the right track” to be reinstated.
Police have charged three people, one of whom is a juvenile.
Police have charged three men with setting fire to a rare wooden church in T<0xC5><0x99>inec-Guty in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dek-M<0xC3><0xAD>stek.
One of the accused is a juvenile, all three are Czech nationals.
They face up to 15 years in prison for the crime of general threat.
The Moravian-Silesian police director Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el told reporters today.
According to him, it was an intentional crime.
"This is a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole matter," he said.
He said police would discuss the possibility of taking the accused into custody.
Further information, according to the director, cannot be published.
"I can't say more yet, because the staff of the criminal police and investigation service and the prosecutor who supervises the case are really working on the matter," he said.
The wooden church of the Body of God in Guty dates back to the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
According to preliminary estimates, the material damage will amount to tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Shortly after the fire, the church began to be rebuilt.
Most of the costs should be covered by the insurance, the additional costs are ready to be shared with the Ministry of Culture and the city, a public collection is also being prepared and the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parish, is expected.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabová was also destroyed by a fire fifteen years ago.
This was caused by an electrical fault.
An exact copy was made in its place.
The state counts on the citizens in the defense of the state.
It will support their training.
With financial support for associations usable in the defense of the state, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of training trainers, he counts on the substantive intention of the law on the readiness of citizens to defend the state.
The Ministry of Defence, which was given the task of processing it by the government, promises from him that it will be able to increase the physical fitness of Czechs and their abilities, which could then be used by the state in crisis situations.
This follows from a proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law were passed in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns in support of the military.
According to its authors, the main goal of the proposal is to create an effective system that would help increase the readiness of the inhabitants of the Czech Republic to defend the state, beyond the performance of military duty and on the basis of voluntariness.
For example, the state would financially or materially support associations of radio amateurs, shooters or cynologists and would allow to increase the abilities of their members.
In return, it would obtain data on people who are willing to come to the country for help in times of crisis, if necessary, and on their capabilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to assist associations and other interested parties in training or education.
It also involves organizing words with war veterans or people who have behaved heroically.
One possible option is to create a new office that would be responsible for the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal emphasize that the participation of people should be voluntary and the state would use their capabilities only after the declaration of a state of threat.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual blurring of the previously obvious boundaries between the different types of threats," it said, referring to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials noted that, therefore, it is necessary to focus on supporting the widest possible set of capabilities, not only military ones.
"The basic goal of the plan is to create a very broad base that will allow every citizen to respond competently to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, or to contribute to the protection of others, and by improper behavior not to hinder the performance of tasks by the armed forces of the Czech Republic," the plan states.
Adoption of the law would bring considerable financial claims.
According to the Ministry, their amount will depend on the chosen variant.
For example, the Office envisages financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defense of the state up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were set up, its operation could cost around CZK 60 million per year.
More money would go to salaries or to build an information system.
The proposal also assumes that the scope of the regional military headquarters would have to be expanded, which would employ a total of 42 additional soldiers.
The ministry’s representatives have previously said that the law should also help resolve the disagreement of some Czech politicians with the introduction of a European Union directive on gun ownership.
Its adoption would allow the shooters who will be part of the system to retain some of the weapons that the directive prohibits.
Startups that will help your company not become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of her startup’s e-commerce employees, but she didn’t find the right survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, unhelpful, or even misleading.
And while it promised the anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their distrust of the entire process.
“I was looking for consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, owner of San Francisco-based hair care company Madison Reed, which employs 75 people.
He asked for help from outside.
New human resources startups are constantly appearing on the market, helping companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with the specific intention of measuring employee responsibilities, startups allow companies to conduct quick voting, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer complete employee anonymity and a hotline for filing complaints, and in some cases also allow whistleblowers to bypass superiors and contact directors directly.
“There are tools on the market like Strava and Fitbit that track your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Reedwood City-based startup Glint.
Errett said she gained more awareness of what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years.
In addition to quick surveys and team-specific voting, Glint offers a temperature map of the company and a quick overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of the managers with low ratings - which allows the user to work on the correction.
Companies are starting to realize that it is necessary to pay attention to the culture of the working environment - in case they become another Uber - which is in turmoil after a former employee posted on his blog a post describing the corporate environment and harassment of employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to Let’s Talk Payments, a website dedicated to technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance industry could exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Denver, Colorado-based startup Convert, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before Uber’s scandals.
Convert’s nearly 600 clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has also recently taken over.
Similar to Glint, Convert allows companies to send customisable “flash” surveys, collect confidential information in real time, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, complaints are sent directly to the Management Board.
“The court of public opinion has its regulators in place,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convert.
If a company is convicted of mishandling its employees or unethical behavior — and if regulators don’t intervene — it could face costly consequences as a result of customer boycotts, employee exhaustion or lawsuits, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to raise employees’ awareness of company policies and procedures and provide an easy way to contact corporate executives.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to find a phone number or e-mail to the management of the company, officially file a complaint and hope for a successful solution.
It was often a daunting and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday’s general counsel, according to which there was no reliable way to track employee complaints before.
Now that the company is using Convert, it is ensuring quick detection and resolution of problems that never before reached managers sitting in offices, miles away from the actual resolution of complaints – such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
“It’s close to a holistic, holistic view of employee experience,” said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday group of risk managers.
"At the same time, we protect shareholders from litigation by employees."
Companies stopped taking ethics, values and employee participation lightly in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed after Enron’s collapse over the abuse of employees’ ethical rights, Quinlan said.
But it wasn’t until “social media lit up” that companies began to realize that in the online world, they simply couldn’t hide their skeletons in a closet.
“Before people started using technology to track ethics, they relied on faith,” Quinlan said.
Both Glint and Convert offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and opportunity that is endorsed by the bold capital investors who have supported both startups.
As part of his February campaign, Convert raised a total of $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and eventually raised $47 million.
Glint raised $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and raised $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing body of research clearly confirms that today’s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, the main advantage is not high salaries and interesting projects.
Employees want to feel that they are being accepted and appreciated and that they are devoting their time to a company that strives for a positive mission.
“If people are happy in their work, they feel that their voice is heard and that their work is rewarding, they are striving for the success of the company,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee benefits at LinkedIn, which uses both Convert and Glint.
Investors make money when companies succeed and companies prosper when their employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market to ensure the commitment and commitment of employees to the company, it is not surprising that there are a lot of investors who will support this effort.
According to work culture experts, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is useless unless the company takes the necessary steps.
The fact is that once a company asks for feedback from its employees, major changes can occur.
And if change doesn’t happen quickly – in the worst case, at all – it can lead to disappointment and disinterest on the part of employees.
“Once you’ve asked for 4,000 opinions, you need to be prepared for 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, director of consulting at Kotter International, which has seen many companies rely too heavily on the data itself.
“Because when you don’t get to the end of it, the employees start asking themselves, ‘Did they hear me?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should I care?'"
Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, can solve the problem in one day thanks to Glint, Errett said.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated with slow decision-making and quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and begin communication training to successfully solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday takes a very important look at its employees and hopes that in the long run this will result in high employment in a field that is known for frequent layoffs.
“If you don’t strive to create a transparent work environment, employees won’t trust you,” Vitrano added.
“And once you start losing employees, you lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole society collapses.”
Thursday was the hottest day.
Thursday, with 38.3 degrees recorded in Strá<0xC5><0xBE>nice in the Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>n region, is still the warmest day of the year in the Czech Republic.
It was the warmest day of the year at 37.3 degrees.
This was reported by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
On Tuesday, however, there were not many temperature records.
Vedra hit mainly Moravia, in Bohemia it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records were broken for 35 of the 145 weather stations spanning more than 30 years.
On Thursday, the record was set by only nine long-term measuring stations.
For example, in Strá<0xC5><0xBE>nice, today’s temperature was the same as the previous record of 2013.
In Lednice in the B<0xC5><0x99>eclav region today, 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree, and in Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice in the Brno region, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as in the case of Strá<0xC5><0xBE>nice, came from 2013.
Today, high temperatures have appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strá<0xC5><0xBE>nice, the greatest heat was in Dyjákovice in the Znojmo region and Brod nad Dyj<0xC3><0xAD> in the B<0xC5><0x99>eclav region, where mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not surpass the record.
In contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Bohemia, according to the CHMI website, the highest temperatures so far have been only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures started to rise there only later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subside, according to the CHMI, and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
In most places of Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the south-east of Moravia on Saturday.
We've had such a mess here.
Billionaires don’t get the same vote as every other adult in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not everyone is as brazen as Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of Penta Marek Dospiva, along with other colleagues behind the water Martin Burda and Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Fry<0xC4><0x8D>, sponsors Robej<0xC5><0xA1>ek’s Realists.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also the chairman of his party.
Convicted corrupt and the king of Czech gambling, Ivo Valenta, bought the Party of Private People.
The political movement Agrofert, as the project of Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> was named by the Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE> mayor Jaroslav N<0xC4><0x9B>mec, is a chapter in its own right.
The mayors have also recently caught their billionaire.
It is Dalibor D<0xC4><0x9B>dek, the owner of the company for the Jablotron security device.
In his own words, he enters politics in order to do good.
However, the entry in the mayor's jersey was not very successful for Grandpa.
“I’ve never had small goals,” he told a news conference.
This means that my goal is to make the YES movement, to make the Mayors movement win 20% in the elections.
Some of them smiled.
But my grandfather's disapproval is rather remarkable.
Billionaire Dalibor D<0xC4><0x9B>dek is a man of strong opinions.
Although he intends to run for the votes in the mayor's jersey, he continues to support Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
My grandfather supported Babi<0xC5><0xA1> in the last parliamentary elections.
“Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is not a seasoned orator and does not have a fondness for political snake rhetoric,” he wrote of him before the 2013 election.
He doesn’t go into politics because he wants to improve himself.
My grandmother will be a hero to me.
He's willing to step out of his controlled world and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors presented him as a new reinforcement, he confessed his admiration for Babi<0xC5><0xA1> again.
And he said that he wants the Mayors to learn how to imagine possible cooperation with Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Some may appreciate that D<0xC4><0x9B>dek does not change his opinions and stands by his side no matter what kind of jersey he wears.
Others may speculate that Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is sending someone so clumsy to build his bécha.
Others may wonder if the head of Jablotron, for example, broke up with the head of Agrofert in a bad way in the store and is not looking for another way to defend his business rival.
But his first public appearance wasn’t just about his grandmother.
My grandfather promised to send ten million crowns to the mayors for the campaign.
If they need more money, they send more.
A few years ago, it would have been hard to put a stop to such a statement.
Besides, the court-recognized gauner Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala wasted millions on all sides before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the security agency V<0xC3><0xAD>ta Bárta, TOP 09 and the civic democrats together came to almost thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone from giving more than $3 million to a political party.
When Grandfather entered politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Perhaps then he would not have to ask why politics has such a bad reputation in our country.
D<0xC4><0x9B>dek then crowned his first days in politics with a proposal for tax advantage for families with studied children.
People with higher education come to us about fifty thousand a month.
Those with a base of less than 20.
A man with fifty thousand men is rich in these conditions.
The one with the 20 poor.
In D<0xC4><0x9B>dek’s vision of society, the poor honestly pay taxes and the rich enjoy the benefits of the welfare state, which they do not participate in very much.
In short, the rich need to be helped not to suffer poverty with hardship.
Mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Babi<0xC5><0xA1> can shake hands.
The rest of us, thanks to D<0xC4><0x9B>dek, can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
Then there is the question of who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who do not regard the members of their party or the citizens of the state as their employees and the country as their property.
And finally, those who want to live well in a rich country for all people, not just some.
Nobody wants Trump's paradise.
The villa complex had to be reduced by 234 million.
Selling a property is sometimes not easy.
And often it does not help even 11 bedrooms, a magnificent view of the sea, or the fact that the property is sold by US President Donald Trump.
When selling the villa complex Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price went down by an incredible 8 million pounds.
This was reported by Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure says of the property, "Hello, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to a place like no other.
But even the association of the real estate company with the American president did not defend the extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to cut the price of his Caribbean mansion by an incredible <0xC2><0xA3>8 million.
The original price of the property was <0xC2><0xA3>21.5 million, with the final price dropping to <0xC2><0xA3>13 million.
Even after the discount, the villa complex costs about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And there's nothing to be surprised about.
The stunning 5-acre estate on the Caribbean island of St. Martin features 12 full-fledged bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym, and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The property also features a swimming pool and tennis court.
There are dozens of palm trees planted on the land.
From the terrace there is a beautiful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price showed the fact that the connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to normal property prices on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about <0xC2><0xA3>15 million.
The property was to be purchased for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
However, with the new price, it ranks second.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at <0xC2><0xA3>13.5 million.
The NCAA has decided to end two training sessions a day. For the Bruins, long days are coming
Eleven o’clock in the morning approaches, and UCLA football players are cramming at the sideline of the new school playground.
Some of them take off their jerseys and reveal their sweaty backs, the unmistakable mark of the first day of training camp.
For most members of the team, doing nothing for a few minutes is a substitute for a midday break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will go to their rooms after a three-hour training session to study for their final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that takes place the following morning at 6:30.
“For these guys, the next three days are going to be a tough one,” Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday rolled over on Tuesday.
By eliminating two training sessions in one day, the NCAA wants to make it easier for players – paradoxically, the training days are even longer – at least until Friday, when the final exams end.
That’s why the first three UCLA trainings are scheduled for 7:15 p.m. – to fit into the already crowded schedules of many students.
For the first time in Mora’s six seasons as Westwood coach, training camp Bruins starts a week earlier than last year and training sessions are limited during the summer semester. The decision to limit the number of training sessions from two to one per day also has an impact.
A total of 18 training sessions are scheduled for August 20, followed by formal preparations for the first game against Texas A&M in September.
Mora has been heard to support the NCAA’s decision, despite adding another item to the already-charged players’ agenda.
"For three or four days the players are under a lot of stress and it's very exhausting for them," Mora said.
"But nobody gave up, everybody's trying. They're great.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down.”
UCLA will be closed at the end of the training camp, which will not be easy when looking at the bright lines of the surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and the luxurious Luskin Center Hotel, which was occupied by players after the protective net behind the goal bar was harvested.
Bruins players should occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora admits that once the rooms are emptied during the season, there could be a problem.
"The property will be guarded by the security service," Mora added.
“Safety is taken care of, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our training.
Such material is well traded.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security, as well as parking lot no. 8.
We will use our resources to the maximum.
I believe everything will turn out well.
Everything is planned.”
Facebook Plans More Fact-Checking to Reduce Fake News
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to third parties for review and display findings under the original posts in an effort to combat so-called “fake news,” the largest social network said on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company says it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, send them to third parties for verification, and potentially display the survey results below the original posts.
Facebook has been identified as one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports influenced last year’s election of the President of the United States.
Political debates are raging in Europe, French voters are inundated with fake news about the May presidential election, and Germany plans to impose a fine on the social media network ahead of the September election if it does not swiftly remove angry contributions.
Facebook said in a statement Thursday that it is preparing to launch testing of a new fake news control feature in the U.S., France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to displaying third-party-verified messages, people are asking for more content to be better informed and able to make the right decisions about what they can share,” Sara Su, Facebook’s product manager for news, said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook is continuing to test the “related articles” feature and is also working on further changes to reduce the number of fake messages.
Creating a graphic novel: the story of A Castle in England
The small Scottish Castle recently played a leading role in the Squeeze music video, and Margaret Thatcher also found refuge in it during the 1970s and 1980s.
But from his cozy spot by the Bewl River in Kent, UK, Scottney has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history that inspired the curly Jamie Rhodes of York County – known for his fondness for historical documents – to create a graphic novel.
“Looking at the handwriting of a man who is 300 years after his death fascinates me,” Rhodes says with a serious face.
"When I hold a letter in my hands, I feel a personal connection."
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of families who lived at Scottney Castle from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, this is not Rhodes’ first book inspired by archives: he is also the author of Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection of British Library-inspired documents – a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was intrigued by the thumbprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for the Jacobites," he said.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those days you had to light a candle to read.
When I smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm going back in time.
I love the archives!
For someone who is so fascinated by old papers, the support of the National Trust and Arts Council England and the opportunity to spend almost four months in the castle is almost like a dream.
Rhodes spent time exploring the Victorian "new" castle, traversing archives, and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of a hyena on a wall and bottles that had been thrown into a ditch for centuries.
He walked around the property, examining the ruins of the old castle, talking to the janitors, gardeners, and occasionally also the artists who worked on the illustrations for his book.
At night, he drank whiskey and wrote.
The confidential history of Scottney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust gained access to the documents only in 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff was only beginning to penetrate the archives, which Rhodes described in words such as “for centuries aristocrats have thrown their hands around saying, ‘Take this to the attic.’”
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps showing possessions: "You may think that the land dispute is boring," Rhodes said, "but I came across one case where two families were fighting over birch.
Stop it, people!"
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a springboard and delve deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the English Rebellion of 1381.
“I found a record of a revolt at the castle in 1380, which was called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex in the book,” Rhodes said.
“The English Rebellion actually started in this area and I thought the Rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe they have something to do with each other after all.”
Other stories are firmly tied to the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest, whom Darrell's family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled a coffin with stones (which was only discovered a few years after the coffin was discovered).
Rhodes' favorite family is the Darrells: "I was intrigued by the male generation - the men of that time were always in debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Different generations of the Darrell family have dealt with it by marrying rich or old housewives – I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to shake their heads at their heirs.”
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes searches for other adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week retreat in the Finnish wilderness, where he drew inspiration for his next book about El<0xC3><0xA4>m<0xC3><0xA4>nm<0xC3><0xA4>ki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that was consumed by nature.
This is a very special place for Scotty.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I thought, 'Now I want to go back to real life.'
Washington changes the terms of the green card
The media published the words of President Donald Trump about the new U.S. immigration plan, which will also include a change in the granting of the green card.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to drop by 50,000 year-on-year as a result of stricter rules on temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and the president.
The bill will soon be presented to Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars by changing the rules for issuing green cards to people in other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
“The new application process will prioritize English-speaking applicants who are well-funded and demonstrate capabilities that will benefit our country,” Trump said.
Sex robots are on the rise - we should be on the lookout
Just when it seemed that 2017 could not be more bizarre, a report about the technological development of sex robots will appear on the Internet.
Yes, sir.
Sex robots are very popular nowadays.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a statement on the development of sex robots within the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and FRR co-founder Noel Sharkey, the rise of sex robots needs to be taken seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the appearance of the nails of the robot.
“People are making fun of them, but sales are going up and we need to be prepared to see them more and more often,” Sharkey said in a statement.
Modern sexual aids are changing from inflatable pans to robotic women with silicone skin that is pleasantly warm to the touch - artificial intelligence, which mimics human behavior, is a matter of course.
The user can "adjust" the robot to his image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the appearance and color of the nails.
However, it is very disturbing that many robots have their own “personality” that would embarrass even Stepford’s mistress.
Modern inflatable dolls have evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set his surrogate wife various character traits, among them shyness.
And then there’s True Companion’s sex robot Roxxxy Gold, which comes with pre-programmed personalities, including the “frigid Farrah” who is shy in nature and the “wild Wendy” who is “adventure” in nature.
“Roxxxy Gold’s personality is set up to suit your personality as much as possible,” reads the True Companion website.
She likes what she likes and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
She may be tired, talkative, or in a “mood.”
The rise of sex robots is alarming for a number of reasons - not to be confused with real interpersonal relationships, but rather to be confused with inferior female character traits and violent insinuations - e.g. frigid (read defiant) Farrah.
On its website, True Companion likens Roxxxy to a vibrator for men.
“If a woman can have a vibrator, why can’t a man have a Roxxxy?”
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a sexual aid.
Their emergence and near-perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply ingrained in our culture – a shift away from ideal or gender equality towards a desire for captivating sex with an optional extra.
Of course, most men don’t buy a robotic woman, and while FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the fringes of the general public.
However, this marginal interest may become a mirror set in the modern times.
And most people aren’t weird or violent until they’re given a free market excuse to do so.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when women all over the world are claiming their rights and a president is sitting in the White House, often speaking very defamatoryly of a woman.
The most terrifying aspect of The Handmaid’s Tale is not what we see—hanging bodies and hollowed-out eyes, but rather the reality of those visions.
The Handmaid’s Tale is a step in the right direction, but at present it seems to be a small step.
Sex robots should resemble real women as much as possible (even with the rates of a porn actress).
Their creators construct them in such a way that they are pleasant to the touch and act at first glance like a real woman.
But when it comes to their “personality,” a robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can’t break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no job, no history, nothing to incite their independence or break their devotion to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
The word of the 21st century: maid.
An NBA star on a green chain.
Curry's fighting in California for a cut.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry did not lose despite a botched first shot at the premier start among professional golfers.
The two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Award winner played the first round of the 74-race Web.com Tour in Hayward, California, for the Ellie Mae Classic.
The Golden State quarterback, who won his second NBA title with the Warriors this season, started nervously and his first shot ended up in a drink holder in a golf cart parked by a fairway.
Even after that, he was not as accurate among the holes as under the basketball basket, yet he left a dozen professionals behind with a balance of four shots over par.
"It wasn't an ideal way to start, to have to call an umpire right after the first shot, but then it kind of sat down," Curry said.
It was very nervous to fire the first shot in the tournament, but it was all I had hoped for.
“If you told me I’d play 74 in the first round, I’d take it immediately,” he said.
If Curry can fight his way through the cut, which is likely to be set two times below par, he will become the first representative of another sport to do so on the Web.com Tour.
“I want to play better next time, and now that I’ve gotten rid of my anxiety, I think I can do that,” said the golfer, who has played in celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward, he starts for the first time at a tournament that falls under the PGA.
To participate in the Ellie Mae Classic, he received a sponsorship exemption and retained his amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is one category below the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big win?
Mitt Romney is the epitome of common sense.
The unmistakable hallmark of the Trump era is the political divisions that divide American voters and, on a micro-scale, tear entire families apart.
During the Christmas and Thanksgiving period, the American newspapers were teeming with advice on how to deal with relatives who vote for Trump.
Supposedly, we're just waiting for him to give us a break.
However, less attention is paid to Trump’s ability to cement the family.
I am talking about this because my cousin, a poet and left-wing fan, who lives in Chicago and has been paying for a Republican fool in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that being locked up in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, all of a sudden the entire family — including all of the Republican siblings with whom they have been bickering about politics for years — is on the same page.
Having dinner at the family table is a good thing; but it strikes me that, in a broader context, it presents a significant risk.
Trump is strengthening the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we’re referring to the frightening possibility that his pranks may one day lose their appeal.
But there is an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly embody what can be called rational.
In these today, with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of crazy behavior - a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (at least we were aware of his tax return) - both of which look like very mild misdemeanors compared to Trump.
After Trump’s departure, it will be enough for the subsequent Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be an enormous improvement.
We took advantage of my cousin's visit and took the kids to Central Park on the largest carousel operated by the New York Department of Parks - for your three dollars, you won't find a better use unless you need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the center cylinder is covered with fiberglass - clowns and animals are filmed and look at their own shoulders in horror - a completely gloomy look, and the rattling music strangely resembles public transport.
Many clichés will soon get tired: the view from high-rise buildings, the panorama looks out, instead of breathing in the atmosphere and the reality of the city does not match your imagination.
Thirty-five years later, I still haven't gotten over the fact that Swiss Cottage isn't really Swiss cheese - not counting the themed Ye Olde Swiss Cottage pub - but a London tube station.
The carousel in Central Park, however, evokes a remarkably magical experience, to the extent that it will be a great time for two two-year-old children, as well as two mature women.
If I could rate the carousel, it would deserve maximum points, but fortunately no one asks.
I had a similar experience in a store this week when I was asked to rate my “experience” on a scale of one to five when paying with a credit card.
It's the same thing at the coffee shop on the corner of my street, except I can throw in a 15% tip for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only does it slow down the otherwise fast sales, but the waitress is forced to pry into the shopper’s favor when it’s not needed.
A woman in the store was apologizing to me with a smile when I reluctantly rated my credit card handing over five stars.
Oscar Pistorius has been transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain.
This is the second time that Pistorius has been taken to hospital.
Last year, he was treated for wrist lacerations, which the prison said he inflicted on himself after falling into a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal against the original conviction for murder.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine’s Day 2013 with several gunshot wounds through the door of a dressing room in his Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed to have mistaken her for a thief.
Prosecutors announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius’s six-year sentence, which they said was too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to South Africa’s highest court and the trial would take place later this year.
If successful, Pistorius could face up to 15 years in prison.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, a captive cub was born by a breeding panda that mated in the wild.
The panda rescue program is a huge success.
The center is trying to expand the gene pool of pandas kept in captivity.
A staff member of the Chang Chung Center told the New China News Agency that the breeding of pandas is at great risk of crossbreeding.
There were only 471 pandas in captivity at the end of last year.
In the wild, only two thousand of them survive.
Trying to mate captive pandas with wild ones is thus the first step in keeping the pandas to help protect this species.
Fifteen-year-old Chao-tschao was released into the nature reserve at the beginning of the panda mating season on March 11.
Thanks to the tracking device on her neck, scientists were able to observe her every step.
She met her chosen one Cao-tschao 12 days later.
Sexual intercourse with a panda male lasted a minute and a half and was successful.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, because panda males are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
Males quite poorly estimate the time when the female is ready, moreover, they are often confused and do not know what to do.
The baby was born healthy and, given that Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after giving birth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in the territory of Greece for illegal camping, bTV quoted the statement as saying.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were detained by Sithonian police in the early hours of August 1.
They were all released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules of free camping and impose severe fines on anyone caught in a place where camping is not allowed.
Checks will be carried out throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Spilková is in 50th place after the first round of the British Open.
Golfer Klára Spilková is ranked 50th after the first round of the British Open.
In Kingsbarns, Scotland, she scored one under-par when she played three birdies and two bogeys.
The 22-year-old Czech player hopes to make the cut for the first time at the famous major.
Entering the competition with a grant of $3.25 million went best to American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round in the field record of 64 shots, that is, eight under par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are pulling millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands has already temporarily closed 180 poultry farms due to the incident.
The Dutch food safety watchdog NVWA said it was investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry farms, meaning 80 percent of the eggs on the market are safe.
The Authority stressed that only a limited number of egg types identified by specific numbers pose a risk.
According to German authorities, the amount of the toxic substance in eggs is small and poses no danger to adults, but it is a potential threat to children.
Czech SVS spokesman Petr Majer said that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities have also started to close the farms, have not been imported to the Czech Republic recently.
However, veterinarians will take random samples of eggs and chicken originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, where problematic insecticide brands have appeared on their markets.
Eggs from Belgium were last on the Czech market in April, according to the veterinary administration, and eggs from the Netherlands were last in May.
Chicken meat from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
However, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands in the Czech Republic.
Fipronil is a substance that is usually part of preparations against fleas, everything and ticks.
However, it should not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The World Health Organization considers the drug to be slightly toxic.
Its high doses lead to a feeling of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss it, says goalie Sedlá<0xC4><0x8D>ek and is looking for engagement.
I'd like to catch another ten years.
"Maybe one day I'll go back there," smiled 27-year-old Sedlá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, who could start the season in a Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n jersey.
It depends on whether he gets an engagement at the start of the new year.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to rate it as high school, I'd rate it as three.
I didn't catch much in the first year, I had an experienced goalkeeper in front of me.
I was studying.
In the second year, I started to catch.
Before the third season, I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalkeeper, and I took turns with him again.
Last year, I always thought I’d catch it.
But in the first ten games we got maybe five points, so the coaches started to roll.
At the end of the day, my colleague was more caught.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play him for next season.
How was life in Riga?
It's beautiful.
It is a small Prague.
A beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're in our third year together, and we're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How difficult is the KHL for goalkeepers?
The first 10 teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Slovan who have to change their playing style against them.
The skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more backwards, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem in the width of the field.
The difference is that the Russians want to play into the void.
They shoot less, and even if they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There are more shootings in the Czech Republic.
Did you have trouble traveling and moving over seven time zones?
If you don’t have a family, that’s not a problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is usually made so that you play four matches outside and then you have two days off.
How do Latvians feel about their club in the KHL?
As a national team.
All of Latvia follows hockey, along with basketball, it is a national sport.
Fans all.
Even though it didn’t work out, there were a lot of people there.
Did Dinamo’s performance in the KHL help Latvia reach the quarter-finals of this year’s World Cup?
The KHL has been played since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And since then, their World Cup results have started to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they fell in the quarterfinals with Canada just 1:2.
This was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to the KHL they reached a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech Extraliga.
In Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n, Roberts Bukarts succeeded and Ralfs Freibergs before signing the contract.
Why do so many come here?
They’re not really good players, they’re really good players.
Local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians are among them.
It is a natural direction.
The KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still unengaged?
At the beginning of February, I knew that I would not continue in Riga.
So we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have a goalie budget, we didn't make a deal.
Then it was a classic.
We played with different teams, but in the final they decided for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n and I'll wait for something to appear.
Aren't you nervous?
That was four years ago when I left here and I didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I am home after some time.
I caught something in the KHL, so I take it differently.
The only question is when and where to sign.
How realistic is it that you will start a new year in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens in a month, where something comes up.
Now all I can do is wait for the agent to talk.
Do you prefer a competition?
Last season wasn’t the season to choose from.
So I'm waiting for a call.
The government's flight to Leto continues.
In January of this year, I wrote about the camp in Lety u Orl<0xC3><0xAD>ku, among other things, in the article With the care of a proper householder.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so let me remind you of the key passages of the article.
Camps have been talked about for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what is going on, it will probably be best if they look, for example, at the official website of the cultural monument Pietn<0xC3><0xAD> place Lety.
There, at the beginning of the historical overview, they learn that the camp stood two kilometers east of the village of Lety, that from 8 August 1940 it served as a working camp, from 1 January 1942 it was a collection camp and from 2 August 1942 it became a gypsy camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhuman conditions, until March 1943, when the first air prisoners were included in Auschwitz transport.
On May 4, 1943, the largest transport to the extermination camp was 370 people.
There were 420 in total.
A very sad history of the immense suffering of human beings caused by human beings and perverted ideology.
There is no doubt that these events need to be constantly remembered.
There is also no dispute that this commemoration should take place at the memorial site of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
Under socialism, the camp was somehow forgotten and in the 70s of the 20th century a pig farm was built near and on part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a monument was unveiled in Lety.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy and demolish the pig farm, but this has not happened yet.
In 1998, the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration falls under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the farm.
So many very brief facts about the post-war fate of the camp.
Only last autumn, the government approved the purchase of the pig farm and decided to draw up an expert opinion to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy the farm.
According to Culture Minister Herman, "there are some numbers, but I would probably thwart those intentions if I went public with them."
We’ll see what the expert opinion brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, it may be hundreds of millions, according to others, the price can reach up to a billion.
Either way, it won’t be a cheap thing.
At the same time, only a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a monument, in which the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the entire transaction was beautifully financed by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is apparently not a threat, I think it would still be a waste of money.
Does the government have any other priorities?
The monument, a dignified memorial site, stands by the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy, and anyone who wishes can pay homage here to the memory of those who suffered and were murdered.
I see no reason to change that!
Let's leave it as it is, and keep the place of remembrance with the utmost care.
The entrusted property, including taxpayers' money, should be treated by the responsible person, in this case the Government of the Czech Republic, with the care of a proper manager.
At least in my own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister are not the whole government.
But even so, from the point of view of the above facts, I perceive the slogan of the leader of the YES movement only as an empty pre-election proclamation.
In May of this year, I went to see the place.
Very decent driveway, adapted parking lot, replicas of wooden camp houses.
In one exposure, in the second integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheatre with the possibility of sitting and overlooking its own memorial place, which is made of stones placed on a slight slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place, as befits and belongs.
Archaeological research is currently underway at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether, for example, it would be possible to preserve some of the uncovered foundations and make them at least visually accessible in an appropriate way.
This is the direction that the Minister of Culture, Daniel Herman, could take.
If he succeeds in forcing the government to buy back the pig farm with state money, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already problematic role as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate may ease symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
But a new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease, which affects up to 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 patients in the UK, causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to use meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms. However, researchers at the University of Washington have found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps to create immune cells that support intestinal resistance.
The study’s lead author, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells protect the gut and ensure the destruction of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that support tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
As soon as the bowls of the scale lean to the side of the inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can occur.
As part of the research, the researchers found the presence of immune cells supporting body tolerance in the stomach of mice with a specific bacterium.
This bacterium requires the presence of tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to form cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We found a link between one species of bacteria – Lactobacillus reuteri – which is a common part of the gut microbiome and the development of cells that support body tolerance.
The more tryptophan mice had in their diet, the more immune cells they had.”
He also suggested that if the same holds true for humans, then a combination of L. reuteri and tryptophan-rich diets would help develop a more tolerant and less inflammatory gut environment.
A post-graduate researcher, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, in a study of a type of immune cell that promotes body tolerance, found that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mice bred separately lacked the cells.
She deduced that one group of mice had a different gut microbiome — a community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally inhabit the gastrointestinal tract.
The guts of the mice were tested by DNA sequencing, and the researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells that the second group of mice lacked.
Mice that were kept in a sterile environment and lacked a gut microbiome — so they did not develop this kind of immune cells — were given L. reuteri bacteria — and formed immune cells.
To understand how the bacterium affects the immune system, the researchers cultured L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the fluid — without the bacterium — to undeveloped immune cells that were kept in isolation.
Immune cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After removing the active ingredient from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent. After halving the doses of tryptophan, at the same time, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us keep L. reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in tryptophan-related genes have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan added: “Each of us should probably strive for the development of these cells, because they control inflammation of the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can increase cell populations."
Jose Mourinho says signing Nemanja Matic and his move to Manchester United 'brilliant'
Manchester United have gained a “genius” in the form of Nemanja Mati<0xC4><0x87> to their team – at least that is what José Mourinho thinks after the midfielder made his debut in Wednesday’s match against Sampdoria.
Mati<0xC4><0x87>, who signed a <0xC2><0xA3>40m contract, appeared in his first match with a 2-1 win in Dublin - the last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup, where United will face Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed in his role as a midfielder alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not take part in the team's pre-season Asian tour, Mati<0xC4><0x87> was out of form and played only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, needs to be worked on before the start of the next season of the Premier League.
"He needs time, but he's experienced, intelligent and has a brilliant mind - he thinks football-wise," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get in shape as soon as possible."
Like Mati<0xC4><0x87>, his new teammates Victor Lindel<0xC3><0xB6>f and Romelu Lukaku also played their first match at Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho is slowly starting to form his 11th for the next season.
An independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign three more players, but insists the club has done a “fantastic job” of bringing three of the four most important players to the team.
"Thank you to the club for helping me get three out of four players," he added.
"Four out of four would have pleased me more, but I admit they did the best they could for me."
Life challenge of the king of chicken skins Ladi Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
The multi-pronged image began to emerge thanks to a new show on TV Prima Zdenek Academy.
Pear sniffed the chance at once.
"Dear Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k, I would like to apply to your cooking academy because I think I can learn a lot from you," he said in a video posted on social media.
And since the two of them have been on top of each other for several years, he hasn't forgotten to annoy Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a this time either.
"In return, I can teach you how to make znojemska from diet chicken meat, American cucumbers, or invite you to water and show you why fried cheese is a favorite," said Pear.
They are serious about their participation in Pohlreich’s new show.
It's time to move up the level and learn from the master.
"The question is, what does the boss say?" he said to Blesku.
Pohlreich did not comment, however, because he was filming new parts of his next show Yes, Boss!.
Only Prima reacted to Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka’s participation in the Culinary Academy, taking the whole matter as his personal activity, which goes beyond television.
Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka struck a big blow to Pohlreich in December 2004 with his first cook.
Within a few days, it sold over 300,000 units!
The new show that Prima presented yesterday at the press conference for the autumn broadcast scheme is a genuine cooking school.
Pohlreich selects his pupils from the audience and introduces them to twelve cooking techniques in twelve parts.
In the last part of his show Now the Chef Cooks in November 2014, Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k had a crossed pear ironed on the back of his T-shirt.
If he had my face, I'd laugh a lot.
"I just smile at the pear - the pear is a healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," said Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a.
He thinks his own way about the culinary arts of the Czech Republic.
"Cooking according to Ladi Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka is out of the question even at home, because I don't have gastropunk at home," says the boss.
Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Pohlreich is very much appreciated, even according to him I make chicken on honey.
But his recipes will definitely not appear on my show," Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka said.
He's an asshole!
He's not a chef to me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomical illiterate or idiot," Pohlreich said of Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ek in a lecture.
"I'm not twenty to be able to wave my hand over them, but I don't deal with them either," Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka said on the account of the insults uttered.
A British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock a car and a house with a wave
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip inserted into the body. With a simple wave of his hand, he can unlock the doors of the house and office and even start the car.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam has had a tiny chip implanted between his thumb and index finger and is currently offering the same service through his company BioTeq to businesses and individuals who want to use technology to simplify their lives.
Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, oversees the implantation procedure and adherence to treatment procedures.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam’s company also offers a service to replace door locks and microchip-compatible cars. The price of one lock is <0xC2><0xA3>300.
The married father of one child has had the technology integrated into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which he starts with a simple wave of his hand.
White House props cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
The White House’s decision to fly a Navy helicopter to South Lawn to celebrate the U.S. manufacturing industry, which took place last month, came at $24,000, according to Navy records published by TIME.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter, also called Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the highlight of the July 17 program at the White House, which was a showcase of American design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and several senior White House officials watched a parade of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut helicopter was displayed next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck, and a Mississippi forklift truck.
A White House military officer issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, requesting the presence of a helicopter less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn as part of an "extraordinary" event, Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) records show.
“I wanted to make sure you were aware of such an important event,” the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his superior, the Navy’s deputy commander for aviation, the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at approximately 7:00 p.m. on the occasion of the show, which is scheduled to begin at 3:00 p.m. and will remain in place until the entire site is cleared, which was scheduled to be between 6:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m.
The e-mail further stated that if there is a delay during the departure from the White House, a replacement crew will be sent for the return flight due to the working hours regulations.
The original crew remained in place that evening, along with the helicopter and a unit of security personnel.
From the records - obtained by TIME - it was not clear whether a second crew was eventually dispatched.
The Hatch Act prevents government officials from using government property for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating a possible infringement of this Regulation.
"We were wondering if this was a violation of the Hatch Act and were assured that everything was in order," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you've been blocked," the deputy commander wrote.
This "Made in America" show was designated by the White House as an official event, and the Hatch Act would not apply to it.
But even official events have political overtones.
While attending the event, the president pushed through Senate-sponsored health reform and talked about trying to rein in government regulation.
The use of air vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when they travel.
However, their presence purely for presentation reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered the check in February after the presidential plane rolled in the background during his first rally as part of a campaign in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is swamped with complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
“The White House is pleased to announce the ‘Made in America’ show, which showcases products from all 50 states manufactured by Americans from American materials,” said Lindsay Walters, a spokeswoman for the White House press secretary.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in the Washington area and at South Lawn and rehearse possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump attended the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America show was part of the crew’s current training, a state official said.
The helicopter unit flew for another 11 hours on the same day as part of a “non-presidential support mission.”
The White House said no additional props were being paid from taxpayers' money.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not in any way interested in negotiations to expose the helicopter to South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and the exact cost of the show is difficult to determine, according to the Navy.
According to the Ministry of Defense, the hourly price for the fiscal year 2017, reimbursement of DoD expenses for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit's logs show a time of 30 minutes from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating cost of the helicopter is well below that amount.
“It’s very misleading to put the cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for reimbursements,” Walters said.
“These estimates include personnel, maintenance, and many other hidden costs that are included in annual costs.”
According to a 2015 RAND study, reimbursements for DoD expenses do not include staff costs, but include fuel price, maintenance and contract costs.
The White House press secretary at the time, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for parade purposes.
“The idea of this week’s show is to showcase products made in the U.S.,” Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to the defense of our state, and that they are providing jobs to hundreds, if not thousands, of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that countless American citizens are involved in making.
This is a fact worth remembering.”
It is not clear whether Trump, during his tour of South Lawn, also looked at the helicopter. With certainty, one can only say that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back at the White House, Trump addressed a representative of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own product fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I own three now."
A young woman was trapped in a swamp by Macha Lake, and the police were wading towards her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday around 2:00 a.m.
Instead of bathing, however, she remained trapped in the marshes.
When she decided to ask the police for help with her cell phone, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"For this reason, the police soon lost contact with her," police spokeswoman Ivana Baláková said.
Several police patrols set out for the place she described, but it was not easy to find the young woman.
"Some of the policemen had to wade through the reed swamps hundreds of meters before they felt the solid ground under their feet again," Baláková said.
She was also missing in the same way.
The officers were guided by the direction in which her call for help was coming from.
"In order not to lose at least this connection, they agreed with her that she would count out loud," the spokeswoman said.
Police found the woman at three-quarters to five in the swamps in the Born<0xC3><0xBD> locality.
She was on the verge of physical and mental strength and showed signs of hypothermia.
That's why the ambulance brought her to the hospital in <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Lip.
Grandfather's connection to Stan?
The bride-to-be becomes a sales girl.
That's a little ironic.
With his web project hradameslusny.cz, it seems as if the billionaire basically told voters that STAN suffers from a deficit of decent people.
He also claimed that the politically disparate group of rather less well-known mayors and independents did not actually have a nationwide program for the parliamentary elections.
Her electoral candidate will simply become a decent person after an interview with D<0xC4><0x9B>dek, regardless of any political opinion.
V<0xC3><0xAD>t Bárta started out like that once, and it didn't work out very well.
In his pursuit of decent people and personalities, who may be replaced by some mayors on the candidates, Gazd<0xC3><0xAD>k admitted, moreover, D<0xC4><0x9B>dek also cancels the popular argument of the head of STAN that the greatest value of the movement is precisely the politically proven and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians even according to surveys.
They will now easily replace the hastily collected unknown personalities.
Gazd<0xC3><0xAD>k explained the total break with the People’s Party, after which STAN changed its logo and slogan, by saying that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the People’s Party.
But if only a few people suspected STAN of identity at that time, after the arrival of D<0xC4><0x9B>dek, even the mere game of identity ends.
Not only did Gazd<0xC3><0xAD>k define himself against Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>'s YES for a long time, but at the first joint press conference, D<0xC4><0x9B>dek, who publicly praises Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, stated as follows: "My goal is that the YES movement, that is, the Mayor's movement, gets twenty percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he didn't make a mistake.
My grandfather is a successful businessman, and a billionaire is no coincidence.
He often talks about politics in the same way as Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, but unlike him, he does not build his own political brand.
For some time now, STAN has been more like a reality show than a real political party, and Grandpa’s helping hand seems to make the desired bride even more like a selling girl.
For some time STAN went with TOP 09, then with the people and now for a change is looking for decent people.
Let's hope someone calls.
Police dogs trained in the bridge overflights by helicopter
Explosive search dogs and search dogs rehearsed helicopter overflights at Lake Bridge today.
The police dog must not be afraid and afraid of flying, said the head of police cynologists of the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> Region Petr Tomá<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Training a police dog takes about two years.
At Most, both trained adult dogs and those who are just passing through the training were trained.
In addition to the standard training, during which they were supposed to detect sharp samples of explosives in the vicinity of the lake and search for the lost figurant, all 12 animals had to board a helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test dogs in a helicopter.
So that as soon as the helicopter lands, the dog can go to work, so that he does not have a problem with the path of the helicopter.
"He gets a helicopter, the dog goes and immediately searches," Tomá<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
A dog that is restless or unable to start working immediately after a helicopter ride is excluded from training.
"For the most part, they keep them in the garden," Tomá<0xC5><0xA1>ek added.
The police have 76 dogs in the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem Region with different specialties.
The majority are German Shepherds, but Belgian Shepherds are also on the rise.
The handler takes care of him from the puppy.
"He's raising him himself, preparing him for the service the dog will do for us," Tomasek added.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations that can reveal possible health disabilities.
If the dog is healthy and carefree, it passes the first exams at 20 months.
"It takes about two and a half to three years to get a sharp hit," Tomá<0xC5><0xA1>ek added.
The length of police service depends on the health of the dog.
It usually lasts for eight to ten years.
They usually live with their dogs.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Pablo Escobar Is Out of the Game, and Cali Cartel Becomes the Centerpiece of Netflix’s Hit Series
Despite the conclusion of the second season of Narcos, when the killer of Pablo Escobar is revealed, the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have already received confirmation from the streaming service - the first one has already received the first trailer and a list of other negative characters.
In the third season, the DEA focuses on the richest drug cartel in the world: Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four powerful godfathers, they operate “like a Fortune 500 company,” except that they escalate acts of violence and bribe more government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays the brains of the operations, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of the connection with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a, a character recruiting U.S. and Colombian law enforcement in the fight against drugs.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will return on September 1.
UN says Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
The elections can only be credible if all members of society, including women, participate, the UN representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, a senior official at the United Nations Relief and Works Mission, said hundreds of women are taking part in local council elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overlooked,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can be fully representative and credible only if women participate, as well as all related processes that are related to the elections.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan will be held on April 5.
The Taliban has published several threats against the electoral process, which shifts international combat activity to the second track.
In this year’s elections, for the first time ever, a democratically elected government hands over its power peacefully to the next government.
Haysom said the strong role of women would strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission said that of the total 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
A unique brewery is brewing beer again.
For a good beer in a resurrected brewery.
A few years ago, the enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners brought the brewery in Lob<0xC4><0x8D>e near M<0xC5><0xA1>en back to life.
The brewery, first mentioned in 1586, has a Renaissance core and in the nineteenth century it was converted into a steam engine operation.
Years of prosperity followed, when the brewery was famous mainly for dark beers.
Unfortunately, production was stopped during World War II and the brewery was nationalized in 1984.
Since then, the buildings have served the state farm.
The work of destruction was carried out by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and disassembled for building materials.
In 2007, however, a new hope was born in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouz.
They began to repair the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They have carefully devoted themselves to the study of archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery has the same shape as in the nineteenth century, when its golden era began.
Their work was awarded a declaration of the brewery as a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture, and the building became part of the European trails of industrial heritage.
In 2015, the tradition of brewing beer was officially renewed.
If you want to taste great lobec beer in the picturesque landscape of Koko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>nsko, visit the taproom in the brewery area.
When brewing beer, they use koko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n spring water in the protected landscape area, malt from lobec fields and <0xC5><0xBD>atec hops.
In the bar you will taste traditional light lager, but also dark beers and specials.
And do not miss the tour of the brewery, it takes place on Saturday and Sunday at noon and at half past two.
The largest artillery fort in Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest fortresses of its type on a global scale?
Such a unique structure was to be the fortress of Stachelberg between Trutnov and <0xC5><0xBD>aclé<0xC5><0x99>, on top of the terrain ridge above the village of Bab<0xC3><0xAD>.
Originally, it was supposed to consist of up to twelve bunkers connected by a vast underground.
There was to be a command post, a barracks, ammunition depots, material depots, a power plant, an engine room, and a hospital.
The construction was completed by the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, a single massive reinforced concrete bunker was built and the underground spaces were broken up.
Thanks to the enthusiasts from the Stachelberg Association, who began to reconstruct the unique building in the early 1990s, you can also visit here.
The underground is now 75% accessible!
The complex includes, in addition to the T-S 73 infantry cabin with an exposition and underground, an armed light fortification facility, as well as two built-up infantry cabins, trenches and the educational trail Fortified Trutnovsko.
Refreshments, a cozy gazebo and breathtaking views of the countryside are guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building was included in the list next to such monuments as the Great Wall of China, Traian's Port near Rome or the Assyrian palaces in Nineveh and Nimrud.
Chot<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xA1>ov Monastery originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today consists mainly of a massive four-winged convent building above a beautiful garden.
The list, which he got, but unfortunately belongs to unique buildings that are in danger of extinction.
Enthusiasts, however, do not want to give up and organize a lot of events in support of the monastery.
One of them is the next edition of the Evening for the Chot<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xA1>ov Monastery this Saturday, August 5th, where Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Mi<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>k, Ivan Hlas, among others, will perform, you will see fencing performances and look at the places of wonderful large buildings that are usually inaccessible.
But above all, you will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.
Do you want to look Neanderthals in the face?
The exhibition Welcome to the Neanderthals in the Anthropos Pavilion of the Moravian Museum in Brno invites you to an unusual excursion to the deepest prehistory to the Stone Age, to the world of our predecessors.
You will find out how Neanderthals were able to perfectly cope with a variety of extreme climatic conditions, especially with the alternation of the ice and interglacial periods.
Despite their simple material culture, they were extremely successful predators of their time.
You will also learn what they looked like, what their anatomy, technological skills and hunting mind were like, as well as their aesthetic sense.
You wouldn't say that to the Neanderthals, would you?
Let yourself be convinced in Brno.

Get to know the plant in one click.
Students with the creation of herbalists and ordinary plant lovers will be helped by the new free application Pl<0x40>ntNet.
If they are interested in what plant they have just encountered on a walk, this application will advise them.
All they will have to do is take a photo of the plant and the application itself will recognize what kind it is.
The new application, which is available for iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the Center for Ethical and Environmental Education CEEV in the Bratislava Mountain Park as part of the project Secret Life of the City.
The project involved pupils from 50 Czech and Slovak schools, who took photos and added plants from their surroundings to the application database with their teachers.
The newly created French app is free to download on the Secret Life of the City website.
The main goal of the French programmers was for as many people as possible to contribute to the application with their images, thereby increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
"Children who hold a tablet or a mobile phone in their hands can go to the forest," said Ivana Polá<0xC4><0x8D>ková, coordinator of the project.
Based on a sufficiently high-quality photo of a flower, leaf or fruit of a plant, the application can recognize its name within a few seconds, which it then assigns under the photo in both Czech and Slovak.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech into the project The Secret Life of the City.
It is therefore welcome that users, after creating an account, contribute to the application with a picture of a plant that is not yet present in the database.
"The French will assess whether it is beneficial and then add it to the database," Polá<0xC4><0x8D>ková said.
GMB Concerns Over Investment in McVitie's Glasgow Plant
Unions are demanding assurances from managers of McVitie's biscuit maker about a long-term production commitment at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish trade union GMB has said it is silent on a possible investment in the Tollcross plant.
The factory employs more than 500 employees who produce, among other products, Hobnob and Rich Tea cookies.
The owner of McVitie’s, Pladis, said it had invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the area over the past few years.
She added that employees and union representatives would be "among the first to be informed" in the event of changes to the plant's operations.
In a letter to the company's construction manager, GMB's Scottish unions expressed their concerns that McVitie's "will not get its promises on financing and upgrading production lines."
GMB chief organizer Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we have not received a clear response from the construction manager regarding the needs of the company and the future investment plan for Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Generations of families have worked here, and employees come mostly from the local community and the Glasgow area, where working in the factory represents a critical pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social exclusion.
In terms of work, wages and benefits – and despite the prospect of Brexit, rising living costs and falling slow production – the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous producer like McVitie’s.”
A spokesperson for Pladis said: “Building Manager Tollcross received a letter from GMB only yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible as we appreciate the continued commitment to employees and union representatives.
A regular meeting with GMB employees and representatives in Tollcross was held two months ago and many issues were openly discussed at this meeting.
We talked to employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the Tollcross area, particularly in production lines and streamlining operations.
We greatly appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and the local area, and in the event of any changes in the operation of the factory, employees and trade union representatives will be informed immediately."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar’s move three years ago?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow in their bid to win Neymar to their side after having deposited <0xC2><0xA3>189 million, the amount needed to buy Neymar out of the contract, but has this French team warned Barcelona of its record raid three years ago?
This sensational transfer has stirred up the waters of summer transfers. Ligue 1 is ready to surpass more than twice the previous record amount for the transfer of Paul Pogba to Manchester United, who paid <0xC2><0xA3>89 million for him last season.
After confirming and completing the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world – after taxes, he will receive over <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 a week from the PSG team.
Barcelona is outraged by the way Neymar has pulled out of his contract, despite a confidential source confirming that the club has always tried to accommodate Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was this fact brought to the attention of the football world three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed their interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all the club that would be interested in taking over one of PSG’s top players.
“I’m not afraid, because as soon as someone tries to get one of our players, then we will certainly reach out to one of their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to win one of our players, they will face consequences.”
Barcelona seem to have crossed an imaginary line when it expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marc Verratti in the summer.
PSG has made it clear that it will not allow the departure of the Italian representative under any circumstances, so it is possible that Barcelona is now swallowing a bitter pill with the departure of Neymar.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have widely understandable rules?
Donald Trump has backed anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the US imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And a day earlier, Trump wrote that China is not doing anything with the North Korean threat and that it will not go on like that.
Even from this, the thought of sanctions smells like straw from shoes.
You can't throw those things in one bag.
Maduro’s Venezuela has really set out on a path to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is not behaving the way the US president would like it to.
Russia is a chapter in its own right.
But if someone wanted to sum it all up so that even the ordinary voter, American, European or other, would understand what the sanctions policy is based on and what system of rules it is based on, it would be an almost impossible task.
In the sanctions against Russia, President Trump is only bringing up what President Obama has already prepared, he has just put an implementing stamp on it.
So why all the fuss?
Last year, Europe feared that if Trump won the U.S. election, it would embrace Putin and lift sanctions.
That's a terrible idea.
In practice, however, it is the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are not being eased, but tightened.
But Europe is even more afraid.
German Foreign Minister Zypries says Trump’s sanctions violate international law.
Is it like kosher is just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there are no kosher or anti-Russian EU sanctions.
European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has complained that Trump’s sanctions threaten the EU’s energy security.
Is it as if the sanctions are to be applied only so weak that they do not endanger anyone?
The ordinary voter is groping.
For three years, he had heard that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depended only on the implementation of the Minsk agreements on the ceasefire in Ukraine.
It is now known that this is the EU's energy security.
The electorate is expanding.
Sanctions are coming on Russia for mounting too much where it does not have.
China is being scolded for not doing enough.
The Venezuelan president is being punished for building a dictatorship within the borders of his country.
All these punishments or mere considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see it as a system, an order, or a rule?
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>: I am not considering cooperation with Okamura.
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is married, crosses the republic with his visionary book and finalizes the election program.
In addition to the Pardubice Region, all candidates are already ready.
According to him, he did not interfere with them in any significant way.
He even agreed that the Moravian-Silesian should be headed by the governor and shadow minister of education, Ivo Vondrák.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a deputy or a governor," Babi<0xC5><0xA1> confirmed his earlier position.
You have angered many representatives and national politicians with your thesis that directly elected mayors and mayors should manage municipalities and cities themselves, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we elect the president directly and I believe that we should also elect mayors.
In my book, I'm not talking about canceling MPs, they can be there.
The question is how many there will be.
At the presentation of your book What I Dream of When I Accidentally Sleep, I heard you talking about the abolition of representative offices.
I don't remember that.
I was talking about the direct election and the reduction of the number of representatives.
New York City, with a population of nine million, has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague, with 1.2 million citizens, has 1,171 representatives.
And the mayor is blamed for building little and not preparing big projects, but she has no competence for it.
The same is true of a government that in our history has been run by only two people, Klaus and Zeman.
I’m not saying they did it well.
The current Prime Minister does not control anything, he only moderates the debate.
That's not how it works.
Is that why you want to enforce the majority system?
It would be ideal, but it would be difficult to achieve.
In the program we have only a change to a one-round election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a sliding mandate for ministers and an amendment to the rules of procedure of the Chamber in order to prevent unnecessary exhibitions of Members, who are to work mainly in committees and committees, not to perform at meetings of the Chamber.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
This is exactly what your opponents are afraid of.
That as a dictator, you will run the government, control the 101-member House of Representatives, abolish the counties and the Senate, and, through grateful mayors and mayors, take over the country.
I'm sure it's not.
There is nothing wrong with debating the number of members.
French President Macron announced the reduction of the legislative body by a third, while there are 57 thousand French people per legislator, while in our country it is based on 17 thousand Czechs.
No one is accusing Macron of endangering democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic won the elections by a majority, we have mechanisms to prevent them from making any dramatic changes.
However, for those who have a parliamentary majority, there is a lot of confusion, just look at Poland or Hungary.
There is no such thing as a yes movement.
We just need a team that will work in the government for the people, not for their parties or ministries.
I do not understand, for example, why we failed to agree that only the salaries of teachers, cultural workers and social services would be increased.
Why did I get outvoted and added 21 percent to the GIBS, who are already taking 60,000?
Is that what you would do as Prime Minister?
The prime minister is expected to intervene when ministers misbehave, confuse the government with a travel agency and would like to do business with the state as Marian Jure<0xC4><0x8D>ka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers in the government should not argue, contradictions should speak outside of it.
Finished material must go to the cabinet, there is no place for coalition splits, force voting and business, there is to be decided.
How do you want to have a cohesive team when the ministers are mostly party-oriented?
There is a constitutional law above the parties.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition agreement was not valid, and kicked Babi<0xC5><0xA1> out of the government.
Any Prime Minister can do that.
However, if he is a personality and has control skills, such idle gestures are not needed.
It measures everyone equally and requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you would propose to the Minister of Finance?
I don't think about it at all, because we probably won't even be in that government, nobody wants to cooperate with us, even though I don't know what I've done so terrible.
So much skepticism is out of place.
The mayors have won the businessman D<0xC4><0x9B>dek, who would like to cooperate with you, with the People's Party he may win the wing of the inclined Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC4><0x8C>unek.
I don't think so.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is led by Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaorálek, who does not rule out a coalition with the ANO, and Václav Klaus Jr., who will also not oppose it, may be promoted in the ODS.
I would leave it to the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice-President of ANO Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with SPD Tomia Okamura, for example, in the field of economics.
So the Okamuras come into play as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, he ran as a puppet of V<0xC3><0xAD>t Bárta for the VV, then he received money for his company from Dawn, there was a coup there.
He is, of course, a strong personality.
A little brown, though.
If I take his program, he has a broad involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, you can agree with that.
That's not what I'm asking you.
I wonder if a person who has xenophobic views is acceptable to you, who speaks at gallows demonstrations and wants to leave the EU?
We are not considering cooperation with Mr Okamura's side, I cannot imagine.
It is obvious that he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the silent support of the Communists to your minority government?
I can’t even imagine it, but it’s up to the voters.
It will be about negotiating the winner with the second in a row, but God knows who will be the winner and who will be the second.
Of course, it is important that they are able to agree on a coalition government programme.
Let's go back to your attempt to run the state as a company.
But the government just has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything go, never decided.
Coalition issues such as CEB or EGAP did not work.
I mean, Sobotka's his puppet, and I think that's why he fired me.
As soon as he did, <0xC4><0x8C>EZ controlled the Czech government.
It is unbelievable that the Prime Minister passed a resolution written by the management of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which instructs the Minister of Finance how to vote at the general meeting of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ.
If you become Prime Minister, will you change the staffing of the Supervisory Board and change the top management of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ?
Jesus Christ, if I'm prime minister, we'll see.
I'm not one yet.
It is rumored that <0xC4><0x8C>EZ has already sent signals in your direction.
He would like to exchange good cooperation with <0xC4><0x8C>SSD for even better cooperation with YES.
After the election, everything will go on.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have any Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> or R<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x8D>ek lobbyists, I'm a separate unit and I don't deal with this at all.
Then answer directly.
If you become the head of the government, will you seek to replace the leadership of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, that is, the institutions you criticize?
We want to be a transparent society.
So far, he has done what he wanted for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
It is enough to follow up on Mr Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although the state is supposed to be in the CEZ majority, it never drove it, it was only there in number, which is wrong.
It's a trivial matter for me.
<0xC4><0x8C>EZ is to take Dukovany, appreciate it, put it into a subsidiary, arrange financing, make a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The idea that the state should finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
What about Czech Television?
Some of her shows are running a permanent, purposeful campaign against me, but I don’t and won’t have any authority to fire anyone.
But to dominate, yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay about $7.2 billion a year for public service radio and television, but they don't really know how these institutions operate.
How come they don't know?
After all, the Chamber approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of the CEOs of the Czech Television and the Czech Radio.
Look at the way these reports are handled, the super power pact Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission on leaks of investigation files and to the lex Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he let Kalousek push me to throw me out of the government, which added up to a percentage of TOP 09, but the CSSD took them off.
They are afraid of disrupting their corrupt system, and so they talk about the threat to Babi<0xC5><0xA1>’s democracy.
No one is immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the first vice-chairman of ANO Jaroslav Falt<0xC3><0xBD>nek is building his power base by putting his son on the supervisory board of Tepláren Brno and arranging contracts with related lawyer Kv<0xC4><0x9B>toslav Hl<0xC3><0xAD>n with city and state-owned companies such as the Prague Transport Company or Czech Railways?
We have a constant dispute about that.
I don't like it, and I've blamed him several times.
Falt<0xC3><0xBD>nek argues that the aforementioned lawyer works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As finance minister, I had no one.
We, unlike the Socans, have never had a corruption affair, no Pelt, Kratochv<0xC3><0xAD>lová, B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
If there was any sign of clientelism, we immediately fired such a person.
I am uncompromising in this regard.
If something like this happens, we get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
