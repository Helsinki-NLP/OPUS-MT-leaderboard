Members of the National Assembly of Wales are worried that they “look like muppets”
Some of the Members of Parliament are surprised by the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This stems from plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that it may be subject to ridicule.
A Labour MP said his party was concerned that it was "rhyming with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't speak Welsh: in Welsh twp means "fool/crazy" and pwp means "kaka".
A Plaid member said the party as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the conservative party said his party was "free-minded" about the name change, but noted that the similarity between the words MWP and "muppet" is great.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similar to the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The National Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a law on the introduction of name changes, said: "The final decision on any words to appoint members of the Assembly, of course, will be made by the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals that indicated strong support for appointing the assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the name of Members of Parliament, the committee prefers Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the most support from public consultations.
Members of parliament are proposing alternative options, but the fight to reach a consensus could cause headaches for Assembly Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to table a draft law on the changes within weeks.
The reform bill will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of members of the assembly and the design of the committee system.
The members of the assembly will give the final vote on the issue of their name when they discuss the law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was set up in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name is a claim to its territory and has consistently opposed the country's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not consider the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, however, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells have fallen silent as churches in Harlem face trouble
“Historically, the old people I talked to said there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there is neither one nor the other."
He said the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People are socializing in a different way today," he said.
“Bars are no longer living rooms in neighborhoods where people go regularly.”
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the properties will not last as long as the leaders think, "and sooner or later, they will return to the same place they started."
Churches, he added, could be replaced by residential buildings full of the type of people who would not help the remaining sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
"Most of the people who buy apartments in those buildings are white," he said, "and so the day will speed up when these churches close completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into those apartments will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis—the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A congregation of blacks practicing their faith nearby takes ownership of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a congregation of blacks during the reign of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the 125th Street vendors, the main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but as members of Father Johnson's parish had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carillon.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin’s, proudly called the carillon “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who played the carillon in July called it a “cultural treasure” and an “indispensable historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who switched to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merivetter said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin in the last few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, part brought by the unqualified leaders of the church, and part of the episcopal diocese.
The church board – the governing body of the church, made up of unqualified leaders – wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese would “demand that the costs be transferred” to the church board, although the church board was not involved in hiring architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some members of the parish complained of a lack of transparency by the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old child while diving for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the opening day of lobster season, authorities said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near the beach of Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB television in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowed to the group to help pull him out of the water.
Hamel stated that at first he thought it was the excitement of catching a lobster, but then "he realized he was yelling, 'He bit me!
He bit me!’
The whole clavicle was visible," Hamel said he noticed after reaching the boy.
“I called everyone to come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” he said.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was taken into critical condition.
It is not known which species was responsible for the attack.
The beach rescuer, Captain Larry Gilles, told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but they decided the shark was not of a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim sustained traumatic injuries in the upper torso.
Authorities closed the beach from the side of Ponto beach in Kasablad to Swami in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety.
Gilles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty shelves in the style of department stores full of professional assistants.
As part of a significant entry into the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn UK beauty market, which continues to grow as fashion and household sales decline, large beauty shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and will be rolled out in multiple stores next year if they prove successful.
The investment in beauty came as supermarkets began looking for ways to use the shelf space that was once reserved for TVs, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its beauty product offering for the first time to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands L’Oréal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup series, so most of the products are vegan-friendly, something that younger consumers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, perfumer Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened in Cradon, south London, last week, and the second opened in Selye Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food on a daily basis at local stores means supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the stores will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to combat the Aldi and Lidl discount with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury’s began putting Argos stores in hundreds of stores, and also introduced numerous Habitat stores after it bought both chains two years ago, which they said boosted grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to reorganize its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots shortly after 2000, but the collaboration ended after disagreement over how to share profits from supermarket chemical stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold 281 of its pharmaceutical stores to Lloyds Pharmacy’s Celesio for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty shelves to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a mandatory beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones ‘angry’ after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has left "angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his branded lifestyle business to focus on her new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their brand Truly for household products and accessories.
The couple's business is linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old morning show host said on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, pulling out of their lucrative, last-minute branded lifestyle business to focus on her new major deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “angry” when a television golden girl admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – meant she no longer had time to devote to their brand Truly for household products and accessories.
The business is linked to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and has been said to double Willoughby’s fortune to an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11m.
As 37-year-old Willoughby said on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left Britain for one of his vacations.
One source said: "Truly has always been at the top of Holly's priorities.
It was to be her long-term future that would follow her for the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all concerned caught them absolutely unprepared.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the opening.
There is a warehouse at Marlow’s headquarters full of ready-to-sell products.”
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of the morning program, which is one of the highest-paid stars of Britain, can cost the firm millions due to large investments in products from pillows and candlesticks, to clothing and household products and the potential for further delay.
It could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The two go on vacation together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become the brand’s ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I’m a Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, “We don’t comment on his business ventures.”
A serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making comments that some would consider “non-presidential” and because he is so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump said in his own voice, disguised as a “newscaster.”
“I didn’t give up on anything.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump hailed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward the denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations on denuclearization have been postponed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North sees no “adequate response” from the United States to North Korea’s early disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the United States is continuing sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his speech at the rally.
"We are very much in agreement with North Korea," he said.
“We should be at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a great collaboration.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results — missile tests had ended, hostages had been freed, and the remaining U.S. troops had returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach when talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we’re going to have 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island and took hundreds of lives
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok was displaced, no natural disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they did not seek international assistance, so it is a challenge," Mr. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is a team that will travel to Palu, it is still not certain that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
Due to the earthquakes that constantly hit Indonesia, the country remains desperately unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight in other coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning was issued, probably contributed to the loss of lives.
At the best time, traveling through the many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
A major point in President Yoko Widodo’s election campaign was the improvement of Indonesia’s old infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has engulfed Mr. Yoko's administration in the eyes of next year's re-elections.
Mr. Yoko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other old weapons.
Watch: Daniel Starridge of Liverpool team equalizes against Chelsea
Daniel Sturgeon saved Liverpool from losing in the Premier League in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xerdan Shakiri handed the ball to Sturgeon about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, while his team lost 1–0.
He moved the ball from the left side before directing it to the distant tripod.
The ball moved high above the hex while turning to the right corner of the net.
The ball finally went over the jumped Kepa Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
“He was just trying to get in that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq are always passing as much as possible, so I just tried to make as much time as possible,” he told Liverpool FC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and I just touched her and I didn’t think much about it and I just shot her.”
Chelsea led 1–0 in the half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward gave a heel back to Matteo Kovacic in that attack, before kicking the ball almost to half the pitch and then sprinting into Liverpool's half.
They quickly made their way with Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> in the middle of the field.
He then directed a missile, taking Hazard to the sixteenth.
Hazard passed the defense and finished in the net of the far-right with a left-footed shot past Allison Becker at Liverpool.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll from Indonesia's tsunami has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many people have been reported trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit Friday and caused 20-foot waves, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was overwhelmed by the blast from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. by Grayson Mows on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police asked people in the area who saw or heard something to make statements.
Detective Inspector Brian Ohagen said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I would ask people who were near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask people, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the cameras of the cars to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation."
A police spokesman said the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and was found inside the facility.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and, as police said, they will inform the victim's close people.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mows had just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him that he was not allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents were told it would be hours before they could return.
Someone overheard a police officer telling a man that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears.
She kept saying, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2 a.m., two police vans were in the cordon, and another one was outside.
Numerous police officers stood in the cordon and watched the apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crime Fighters Anonymous at 0800 555 111 citing record 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in parliament has become the latest memorabilia in a row over “rewriting history”
Her persecution would be poetic justice for his "Taliban" destruction of a number of cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclast of the English Civil Wars was neither commissioned nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would sacrifice himself for the works of his ancestor, Thomas, in the previous century.
Cromwell's magnificent presentation of Sir William Hammo Thornecroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many feel, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is the subject of continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th-century conflict shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually identifiable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and mentioning."
Pig-murderer dismembered and killed a Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his last name “Juan”, was found dead with a torn artery, covered in blood near a market in Liupanshui in Gizou province, South China, the Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door of a neighboring pig coop.
He stated that there was a large boar in the cocoon with the blood of the muzzle.
A forensic examination confirmed that a <0xC2><0xA3>550 boar tore the farmer apart and killed him, according to the report.
“My cousin’s leg was bloody and torn,” said the cousin, given the surname Wu, according to a quote in Guiyang’s evening news.
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Juan or his cousin.
A market manager told the evening news that the pig had been locked up to prevent an attack on other people, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and those in charge of the market are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a <0xC2><0xA3>650 pig pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as an "activator."
“They’re just playing.”
They like to nibble, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone on purpose.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rain to the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves through the cold waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring rainstorms to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the next few days.
Rosa brought 85 mph winds, a Category 1 hurricane at 5.00am Eastern time on Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to infuse a large tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture with depression approaching will create heavy rains in the southeast in the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause flash floods, debris flow, and possible landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical moisture will cause precipitation that in some places will be approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in part of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible due to rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is especially recommended not to walk in the desert in case of tropical rain.
The torrential rain can cause canyons to become stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will bring locally strong winds and dust.
The approaching depression will bring a locally torrential rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Rains of more than half an inch in total are possible, which can cause rivers of rubble and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region since its wet season.
Occasional tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads further late Monday and Tuesday.
The torrential rain will spread to the "four corners" on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes are expected across the U.S. due to cooling in the Arctic, but the tropics remain at high temperatures.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
An excellent example of a dramatic temperature difference will be seen in the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is almost a 20 degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moyne, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to re-create and expand.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm start to October with high temperatures of 80 degrees Celsius from the southern plains to the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our forecast for the longer term suggests the possibility of above-average temperatures for the eastern parts of the United States, up to the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brad Kavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people watched the thrilling testimony Thursday of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christina Blassie Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the stalemate in politics continued, with speakers interrupting regular turnaround programs at the last minute on Friday: Jeff Flake, an Arizona senator, drafted a deal with the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee she was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was picking up the piano and trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen, watched it on Friday.
The company counted average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for the other networks they featured, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring people who look at offices.
To put it better, it is an audience of a size similar to that of a playoff game in football or a film academy award.
Fox News, whose anchors strongly attacked Kavanaugh’s appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderately Republican office issued an announcement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught him calling protesters on Friday morning as he was trying to get into the elevator for a hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes as he was being reprimanded, all of which was broadcast live on CNN.
"They're standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth on earth?"
He was told, "You have power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks all covered hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was due to vote to advance Kavanaugh's Senate nomination for the vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if there was an agreement with the FBI to consider the charges against the nominee next week, which was requested by the Democratic minority.
Flake was persuaded in part by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After a conversation with Koons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election was of great importance because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the newspaper's front page, her former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called "Checkers" Brexit plan, saying the suggestion that Britain and the EU should collect mutual costs was "completely absurd".
Wade Simms shooting: Police arrest suspect Ditheon Simson over death of Louisiana State University athlete
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Ditheon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and taken into custody on charges of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, and police said Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson’s DNA on them, a WAFB partner told CBS.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wade and killing him.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The eastern Baton Rouge parish pathologist’s office released a preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head to the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police’s refugee unit, the state police’s crime lab, the Southern University police force, and the citizens of the area for the assistance they provided in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director at Louisiana State University thanked police for their "activities in the pursuit of justice."
Simms was 20 years old.
The 6.6-footer grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 goals per game last season.
On Friday morning, Louisiana State University basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "destroyed" and "shocked" by Simms' death.
“This is what you worry about all the time,” the coach said.
Volcano erupts in Mexico City
The ash ejection from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached southern Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Sunday not to go to the volcano after activity began in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center was followed by more beatings and tremors.
Images on social media show a thin layer of ash on cars in Mexico City, such as Sochimilko.
Geophysicists have seen increased activity at the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with police for public order and peace and after thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of a polarizing vote to secede Catalonia.
A group of masked separatist supporters held by public order and peace police threw eggs and paint into the powder, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would normally be filled with tourists.
Later in the day, fights also broke out, and police used batons to suppress the fights.
For more than a few hours, independence groups chanted “No forgetting, no forgiveness” and, on the other hand, union protesters chanted “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence-loving region, a year after Madrid characterised the October 1 referendum as illegal but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The majority of voters voted for independence, although turnout was low due to a boycott by people opposed to secession.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police violently tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations took place, but they had to change the route.
Sixty-eight-year-old electrician Narcissus Termes, who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia had a chance of gaining independence.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I watched my parents cry with joy because they could vote, but now we are stuck,” he said.
Despite winning a vital but narrow victory in last December's regional elections, Catalan independence parties struggled to maintain momentum this year with many of their best-known leaders either in self-imposed persecution or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic, Hoan Puig, recording the protest in support of police, said the conflict was supported by politicians from both sides.
“It’s getting more intense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders jailed ahead of last year's trial, announced he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
“Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after they drove a car into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly ramming a car into a house in Londonbury.
The incident occurred in Ballinagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blumings said damage was caused to the gate and the building itself.
At some point, he may have been shot with a crossbow at the car.
Menga's goal brought Livingston a 1-0 win against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
The improved Livingston beat the Rangers by signing Steven Gerard, with only two losses in 18 games, as manager of Club Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal proved to be significant as Gary Hold's side climbed one level with Hibernian in second position.
Gerard's side was left without a away win this season and will face the leaders of the Harts next week, behind which they are behind by eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continue undefeated in the division for six games, and coach Holt has yet to face a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed the chance against the cruel guests
Holt's team had to lead for a long time before they scored, and their directness caused a lot of trouble for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way, but pulled the attack around the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only direct his efforts from afar after sliding off to play the head-butt of Craig Halket over the goal.
The guests gladly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause them problems with the set actions.
And that’s how the goal came about.
The Rangers missed the free kick, and Livingston got the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson set up Menga together, who just touched the goal from the center of the sixteenth.
By this point, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but were unable to break through the defense of the hosts, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly for the most part did not play.
That pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos was successful in rescuing Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to score due to the skill of Ranger goalie Alan McGregor, and Lithgow took the ball away from another set-up by Livingston.
Livingstone's sixteenth was repeatedly crossed and repeatedly defended, while two penalty requests – after Halket's challenge for Glenn Middleton's replacement and one for hand-play – were denied.
“Phenomenal” by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont at BBC Scotland in the Tony Maccaroni Arena
Phenomenal game and result for Livingston
They were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on this uphill track.
Their playing style and character barely changed after their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he has galvanized the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was outstanding, managing a super organized defense, but Menga still kept Conor Goldson and Joe Waral on the line.
The Rangers still lacked inspiration.
As good as they once were under Gerard’s leadership, they are now lagging behind by the same standards.
Their last game was weak – they only managed to open the hosts once – and that’s a bit of a wake-up call for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received a mixed reception in the Colony
There were smiles and blue skies on Sunday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They have worsened due to problems involving human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU accession.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then headed to the Colony to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, have also spoken out, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Opposing protesters mirror the separation of the visitor, celebrated as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Traffic Accident on Deptford Road: Bicyclist Dies in Car Crash
A cyclist has died after a collision with a car in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, a high-traffic thoroughfare in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city at around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The collision occurred months after the death of another cyclist in a car crash on Childers Street where the driver fled, about a mile from the collision on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roadblocks have been placed and buses have been diverted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Injured in Riots
Six prison officers were injured in riots in the high-security men's prison, the prison's office said.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at around 9.30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialists from the Tornado unit were brought in to resolve the unrest, which includes eight prisoners and is confined to one wing.
Officers were treated for minor injuries at the scene.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been instructed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend additional time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor had received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, public order and peace police were called to the prison to deal with serious riots in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash floods (may be beneficial for arid areas)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that’s likely to happen early next week when the remaining strength of Hurricane Rosa passes through the desert southwestern region, bringing the risk of flash floods.
The state weather station has already issued warnings of possible flash floods for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, as far as southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Sight Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route across the Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix State Weather Station tweeted that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status in the 200-mile range of the Phoenix since 1950!
Katharina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the State Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches at the edge of Arizona's Mongolon.
Other areas of the desert southwestern region, including the central parts of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated areas of up to 4 inches of rain.
For those outside the risk areas for flash floods, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, part of this rain is likely to be beneficial because the southwestern region is affected by drought.
“According to the U.S. drought watchdog, nearly 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme drought, the second-highest category.”
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa led to landslides all over Mexico’s Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, still hurricane-force on Sunday morning with winds of up to 85 mph, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 12 mph.
The storm is coming into contact with cooler waters in the Pacific and is receding.
Rains are expected in Mexico with a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be intense and pose a significant risk of flooding.
"It is expected to rain 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a possible maximum of 10 inches of rain," the weather agency said in a statement.
Rose will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and in southern Utah until late evening hours of Tuesday.
"The main hazards expected from Rosa or her remains are the very heavy rains in Baja California, southwestern Sonora and the desert southwestern region of the United States," the State Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening flash floods and debris flows, as well as landslides in mountainous regions.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital and is in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old man, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
The police asked if anyone had the cell phone footage of the incident to step forward.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered the greatest malice and anger” of the Democratic Party.
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s most brutal and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the greatest malice and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying allegations by Christina Blassie Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A positive vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable record of public service," he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh’s nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the early election.
“Five more weeks until one of the most important elections of our time.
I’m not running, but I’m really fighting,” he said.
That’s why I’m everywhere and I’m fighting for great candidates.”
Trump said Democrats have a mission to “resist and hinder.”
The first key vote for Kavanaugh’s Senate nomination is expected no later than Friday, a senior GOP executive told CNN.
Hundreds dead in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, total death toll rising
At least 384 people have been killed and many have been swept away by huge waves hitting beaches as a major earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday as waves of 6m (18ft) high struck the coast at sunset, leading many to certain death and destroying everything in their path.
After the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5, a tsunami struck.
“When the tsunami threat hit yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mediation agency, told a briefing in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come on its own, pulling cars, trees, houses, hitting everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled through the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, curved and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent tremors continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said the energy released from Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times more than the energy released from the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The geographical position of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow coast, may increase the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the quake's epicenter.
Communication "was completely damaged without any information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” they said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not informing us that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said the waves came around the same time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floors of a building can be heard shouting franticly, warning people on the street below of the approaching tsunami.
In a few minutes, a wall of water is hammered onto the shore, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees are still in desperate need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport was reopened for aid only and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Widodo had planned to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The total number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
It's really bad.
While World Vision staff from Dongala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees sheltered in tarpaulin shelters in the courtyard of their office, they passed through scenes of desolation along the way, Mr Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses that were destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even as aid groups began dark attempts to start aiding the disaster, some complained that foreign aid experts were prevented from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, financial support, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to arrive if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn’t happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Auliya Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we can accept international aid, but it still has no status."
As the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of the missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that would ease the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The others stuck at the Roa Roa hotel, Mr. Mandagi added, were his students.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recounted how, when the news of the Roa Roa Hotel’s collapse began to circulate in the paragliding community, he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to Palu contestants participating in the beach festival.
But his messages ended only with a gray ticking sign, instead of a blue one.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves Steal $26,750 at Newport Quay to Recharge ATM
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was supplementing an ATM at Newport Pier on Friday morning, according to a press statement at Newport Police Station.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to replenish it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "ran from behind a Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw more suspects fleeing the scene of the crime, according to the statement, but police did not give a specific number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information on their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Yei
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Yea.
He posted the change on Twitter on Saturday. He wrote: "The creature formerly known as Kanye West".
The 41-year-old West was nicknamed "Yay" for a while and used the nickname for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came just before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace singer Ariana Grande at the show, which he had to cancel for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
Although he uses it as an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said the word has religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘her’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible and it means ‘you’ there,” West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“It’s you, it’s me, it’s us.
It started from Kanye, which means the only one, to Yei alone, a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more about who we are.”
He is one of many rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, Jay-Z also uses his name with or without a hyphen and all capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexico’s acting president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed to never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador vowed on Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to repress the Mexican people".
The military fired on peaceful protesters in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly aid to those studying and by opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are attracting young people to criminal gangs.
U.S. to Double Funding for Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding in the field, said AI developer and practitioner Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. has no formal strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be number one in innovation for artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Doubling the AI budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next discovery in AI," Li said.
Doubling the funds could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will be made by the United States, Li said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures+, which invests in one of China’s most prominent companies.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the top-ranked American player at Othello, and later was director of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee thanked the U.S. government for previous technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when the next competition would be, in order to help identify future visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government grants, Li said.
“It’s not China that takes academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Li said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired experts from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Li said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctors of science in artificial intelligence," he said.
The State Council of China issued its Plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s state-run Natural Science Foundation is funding people in academic institutions similar to the way the Natural Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which should include partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of an authorized committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, they currently invest more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation requiring the creation of a National Artificial Intelligence Security Commission has been in effect for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
People in Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to “Republic of North Macedonia,” a move that would settle a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked its bids for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims its northern neighbor’s name is a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's Orthodox population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to allow entry into bodies like the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," Olivera Gjorgievska, 79, said in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout stood at 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came out to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko gave their vote in the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name, which will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, on September 30, 2018 in Strumica.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov was preparing a small stage and chairs in front of tents set up by people who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads held high, not from the rear entrance," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said the result "yes" would be "confirmation of our future".
The poll, published last Monday by the Institute for Political Research of Macedonia, showed that between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters will take part in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian broadcaster Telma, showed that 57 per cent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent will vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, turnout would need to be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policies since it came to power in May last year.
Sergio Aguero at Manchester City has passed the entire defense of Brighton for a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling quickly defeated Brighton in a 2-0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot look so simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a midfield pass at the start of the sequence.
He quickly passed between three defenders at Brighton, before entering the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four "greens".
He bypassed one defensive player before running a few others on the edge of Brighton's hex.
He then passed to the left of him, to Sterling.
The English striker used his first approach to the hex to return the ball to Aguero, who beat Brighton's goalkeeper, Matthew Ryan, with a single shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero has leg problems," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We played 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to score at that point.”
But the initial advantage of the "sky blues" gave Sterling in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received a long ball in Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful straight ball along the left side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched her a few times before taking Sterling to the remote tripod.
The attack of the "sky blue" brought the ball into the net before it came out.
City will fight Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match at 12.55 on Tuesday at the Rhine-Neckar Arena, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a spoiler against Rokis
Since the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to stand in the central square on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who lead by one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
The Rockies had at least a "joker" for a 5–2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still struggling to establish their place in the first division.
“While we’re not playing for anything, at least we’ll be able to throw knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to be played at the highest level of any moment I’m going to face this year.
“Why wouldn’t I want to compete?”
Nationals are still due to announce a starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to allow Scherzer to pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will start for the 34th time, trained throwing on Thursday and will throw normally rested on Sunday.
Washington's right is 18–7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court as he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in early elections.
“Everything we’ve done so far will be at stake in November.
Five more weeks until one of the most important elections of our time.
This is one of the big ones, big one – I’m not running, but I’m really fighting, so I’m everywhere fighting for great candidates,” he said.
“You see these horrible, horrible groups of Democrats, you see what’s going on right now.
And they are determined to regain their power using all the means at their disposal, you see malice, rudeness.
It doesn’t matter who they hurt, when they have to run over in order to gain power and control, that’s what they want power and control, but we’re not going to give them that.”
Democrats, he said, have a mission to "resist and hinder".
"And you've seen that in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry, mean, insolent and untruthful."
He mentioned Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein, appointed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, by name, to which the audience responded with shouts of revulsion.
Do you remember her answer?
Have you published the document?
Oh, oh, what.
No, no, wait a minute — it was a very bad body language — the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
People no longer have different opinions.
No one is tolerating those who express their opinions.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted against me, it was hardly a surprise.
However, I am only the last member of parliament from the Labour Party to be told that we are not welcome – just because he is expressing his opinion.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joanne Ryan, received similar treatment because she took a firm stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
For the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting of Nottingham’s East Labor Party stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a Labour MP, the council meetings on Friday night were just that.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of most meetings today, and the promise of a “softer, gentler” policy has long been forgotten, if indeed it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differing opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and any opinion is being judged as acceptable to party leaders.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought we had previously shared a similar political opinion began to expect me to completely change my thinking and take positions that I would never have taken otherwise, whether it was about national security or the EU’s internal security.
Whenever I speak publicly, and it doesn’t really matter what I say, there’s a critical social media bullying that calls for condemnation, denial of the center’s policies, telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labor Party.
I’m not the only one with this experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexist or racist bullying every day, but never back down.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labour Party should practice a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions, and with every demand for “no trust” or a change in the selection rules, the party becomes more narrow-minded.
I’ve received a lot of advice over the past two years telling me to keep my head down, not to be so loud, and then “everything will be fine.”
But that’s not why I’m in politics.
32 years ago, when I joined the Labor Party as a student, provoked by the negligence of the Thatcher government that literally let my classroom collapse, I struggled to improve public services for those who needed them most, whether as a local councillor or government minister.
“I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused in any way about my political views and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
To those who supported Friday’s request, all I want to say is that when the country goes to the brink of a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I don’t understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But I have one message that is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no matter how many damning threats or political opportunism I survive, nothing will deter me from acting in a way that I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for East Nottingham.
Ear 38 – 17 Melrose: the undefeated Ear goes to the top
The two late points may have changed the end result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ear deserved the triumph in this wonderfully entertaining match on the day of the Scottish Rugby Championship.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the ten.
In the end, everything is due to their superior defense, as well as their improved chances, which the home team took, and coach Peter Murci has the right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested through our games so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose stated, "Praise to Ear, they took their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute point, converted by Fraser Klimo, gave Ear an advantage, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given to the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to improve the numbers, and Jason Baggott grabbed an unconverted point.
Klimo delayed Ear's lead with a penalty kick, before, right at half-time, he scored a point, so he converted a solo point to score 17–5 for Ear in the rescue.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's point, converted by Bagot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was then a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruarid Nott, who was carried on a stretcher, and from the start, Ear continued to struggle with Stafford MacDowell's point, converted by Klimo.
Ear's WD captain, Blair McPherson, then received a yellow card and again, Melrose charged for the extra man with an unconverted point to Bruce Colvin at the end of the time with relentless pressure.
But the home team rebounded and when Struhan Hutchinson received a yellow card to knock Klimo off without the ball, McPherson scored a touchdown from the penalty line on the back of a sharp attack on Ear.
Klimo converted, as he did again almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe took the hit of David Armstrong and sent winger Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the home team.
'Still Game' star looks set for new restaurant industry career
Still Game star Ford Kiran looks set to move into the hospitality industry after being revealed to be named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old is played by Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he co-wrote and co-starred with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphyll.
The duo announced that the next ninth season would be their last, and it looks like Kirnan is planning for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kirnan was trying to get involved in Glasgow's "successful restaurant trade".
‘The sea is ours’: Land-surrounded Bolivia hopes court reopens path to Pacific
Sailors patrol a covert-counterfeit naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings set up a sea-blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with the motto: “The sea is ours by right.
It’s our duty to come back.”
Throughout mainland Bolivia, the memory of the coast lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh, as is the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
Those hopes may now be at their highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by an international court on October 1 after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and calm, and of course expects a positive outcome," Roberto Calzadia, a Bolivian diplomat, said in a statement.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the international court on the big screens all over the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia's lawsuit that, after decades of volatile talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also depends heavily on Monday's verdict.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia's favor and won't change much even in their favor.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to grant territory to Chile and has said it will not decide the outcome of possible talks.
The international court’s ruling comes just six months after the final arguments suggest the case “wasn’t complicated,” said Paz Zarate, an expert in international law from Chile.
And the last four years may have put Bolivia's cause behind it instead of improving it.
"The current Bolivian administration has used the problem of access to the sea for its own purposes," Zarate said.
Morales' bellicose rhetoric undermined Chile's remaining goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Welce, the Bolivian envoy to The Hague, dismissed the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadia also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the sea issue as a political backer.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“A decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says it won’t achieve nuclear disarmament if it can’t trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made during a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on the verge of restarting blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it’s “fictional” to think that prolonged U.S. sanctions and objections to a declarative end to the Korean War will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up its arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of massive hats en route to the biggest stores near you
If you want to improve the size of your collection of hats or completely block the sun, then look no further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown revealed a series of freaky oversized hats for their SS19 collection on the runway that dazzled the style set to Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats launched Instagram this summer and these designers sent out their eye-catching creations across the runway.
The piece that stood out from Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide perimeter in the form of feathers that flooded the head of the model.
Other oversized accessories included zircon watermelons, a magic hat, and even a pineapple, but they’re not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sutured lips and resembled more Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled diving equipment entirely with goggles and a diving tube, and the other looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you are in luck.
Followers of the style predict that huge hats can come to the stores near you.
The oversized hats came very soon after "La Bomba", the two-foot-wide straw hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic fashion house behind the overly impractical hat that has spread across social media has sent another big creation down the runway, a straw beach bag almost equal in size to the height of the model it dragged.
The dark orange raffia bag, with a raffia bordeaux and a white leather handle, was the piece that stood out in Jacquesmus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the big hats and beach bags in stores next summer because the designer has made such a big impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, which only amplifies the individual and group success in sport, the arts, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As an educational center that can design and implement customized school programs, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desired as an elective in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that will make him conceited.
If you talk to him in his own language, it will hit him in the soul.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can see that languages outperform all other subjects with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher score of “5+”.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher "5+" grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also achieved a "5".
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly acquire in the future.
Languages are now seen at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in independent school programs, as well as elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that 17 per cent of the reasons employers cited for failing to fill jobs were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more jobs looking for languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter which career someone chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future having such a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give the polyglot an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults from the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to speak, and French was the only language spoken by over ten percent, i.e. 15 percent of people.
Therefore, investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
Having multiple languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ according to the languages it teaches.
Several schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important in the UK when viewed in the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child’s interests are, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with professors who are specialists in the field.
Scottish Independent Schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
Currently, it cannot be denied, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital for the future of the country, so this must be replicated in schools.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
"Il faut bien le faire" (that must be done).
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will take the Lakers to San Diego on Sunday.
The wait was almost over for fans who wanted to see LeBron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play his first game of the preseason on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How long they will play has not yet been decided.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudeau tweeted that James was likely to play for a limited time.
After training early in the week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game schedule ahead of the Lakers season.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
YouTube channel for Trump rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump began a series of rallies as part of the campaign, tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was the first of five scheduled Trump rallies in the next week, including visits to pro-Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm his choice to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court is at a standstill, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections because Republicans could lose control in Congress with the November vote.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. East Coast Time Zone tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online on YouTube.
This week, Trump is likely to address a hearing with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of misconduct of a sexual nature with an expected Senate vote delay of up to a week while the FBI’s investigation continues.
The primary goal of the rally series is to help Republicans gain momentum for the November election.
President Trump’s campaign said the five rallies next week were aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and House,” according to Reuters.
“Control in Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the campaign season begins,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, who declined to be named.
Scheduled at the Wesbanko Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could draw supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia's Metro News.
Saturday is Trump’s second visit to West Virginia in the past month, a state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrissey, who lags behind in the polls.
"It's not good for Morrissey that the president has to come to improve the popularity of polls," Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: Team USA showed courage in the fight to keep their hopes alive at the start of individual matches on Sunday
After three one-sided seasons, the Saturday afternoon fours may have been just what the Ryder Cup needed.
The twist of luck is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, and most of all in such matches.
Who would have thought that happiness was now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now it's four, so we're a little bit lucky I guess," Jordan Spite said at the end of today's competition.
The Europeans have the advantage, of course, the lead of four points and twelve more games.
The Americans, according to Spit, feel that they have a weak wind in the sails, although they have enough incentive, if nothing else then the form of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Sleep was great and leads by example.
Those strong shouts of celebration grew stronger throughout his game, with a key punch that led to a four-to-four draw when he and Thomas had two misses after two rounds.
His shot at 15 was met with a similar exclamation, one that tells you he believes the American team is not out of the game.
"You just have to go deeper and worry about your match," Spit said.
That’s all that’s left for every player.
18 holes to score a point.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but wonderful duo of Europe are four out of four and can’t go wrong.
The Molywoods were the only pair without bad hits on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad hits on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine on Friday morning.
That series and the way their energy seems to be flowing to and from this noisy group ensures that they are the players to win on Sunday and that there will be no other popular players to provide a potential European victory when the sun sets behind Le Golf National, other than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, the talk of European glory remains unwarranted.
Buba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of doubles, when he merged with Alex Norén.
A missed shot and two doubles from the top nine buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they never managed to get out of.
On Sunday, though, there's no one to help you get out of the hole.
Doubles and quads are so fascinating to see up close because of the interaction between partners, the advice they give each other, the advice they don’t listen to, and the way strategy can change at once.
The Europeans played better as a team and thus achieved a significant lead on the last day, but the four-day season also showed that the US team can fight even though some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europeans lead 10-6 on Ryder Cup final day
Europe will enter with a solid lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's lead in doubles and fours of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two wins while Tiger Woods struggled to take the lead so far at Le Golf National on four points.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn’s European team, which struggled to keep the trophy it lost at Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the American team, which had many early morning doubles misses and won the series 3-1.
The Americans put up more resistance in the fours, winning two games, but could not reach the lead.
Jim Furik's team needs eight points out of 12 individual matches a week to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molywood" after the sensational weekend, are the second pair ever to score four points in the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in doubles, they played great and beat worn-out Woods and American rookie Bryson Deschamps with an even more pronounced score of 5&4.
Woods, who made his way through two matches on Saturday, has at times played great, but has now lost 19 of 29 matches in doubles and fours and seven times in a row.
Justin Rose, resting while the morning doubles lasted, returned as Henrik Stanson's partner in the 2&1 loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
However, the Europeans did not like that pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time reigning victors Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a two-point tally for the Americans on Saturday.
They scored a decisive 2&1 win over Spain's John Rahm and Ian Pulter in doubles and came back later to beat Pulter and Rory McLroy 4&3 in fours, but lost in the opening two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team recovered from a lack of four points in an individual game, although as title holders, Furik's team was equal enough to keep the trophy.
After a second two days, however, the Sunday counterattack seems to remain above them.
North Korea says 'no way' to disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that prolonged sanctions deepen mistrust in the United States and that there was no chance the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body’s annual general assembly that North Korea took “significant goodwill measures” last year, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling nuclear test facilities and committing to countering the proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see an appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way we can unilaterally disarm first."
While Ri echoed North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a nuclear disarmament approach “in stages,” according to which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for the steps taken, his statement seemed significant because he did not refuse unilateral, nuclear disarmament without discussion, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri alluded to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit of the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward “nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula” while Trump gave a guarantee to North Korea’s security.
North Korea seeks a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States argues that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused to give in to tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament first and foremost' and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even opposes the 'declaration of an end to the war'," Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a vain dream of people who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the existing sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the other side in this nuclear disarmament problem was South Korea, instead of the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have ended in such a deadlock.”
Despite this, Ri’s tone was markedly different from last year when he told the U.N. General Assembly that directing North Korean missiles toward the U.S. mainland was inevitable after “Mr. Wicked President” Trump called Kim a “rocketist” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened the “total destruction” of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament steps, but said much remained to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a timeline for that, saying, “Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months — it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council's sanctions must continue in full and without exception until complete, final nuclear disarmament is confirmed."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in order to hinder funding of Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but was denied by North Korea only hours later because of "gangster demands".
North Korea has pledged to meet Moon this month to disarm a missile facility as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the "appropriate measures" he was seeking were security guarantees Trump gave in Singapore, as well as moves toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Attend Courses to Get Enough Vacation
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to teach all graduates more sleep in order to combat the growing macho culture of learning by staying up all night with the help of caffeine.
One researcher found that students at the world’s leading university often know nothing when it comes to basic self-care.
Charles Chysler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, designed the course he believes to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of insufficient sleep on learning.
“At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this now, in the last year?’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep — which surprised me,” he told the Telegraph.
The course, which was offered for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive assignments.
In one section, there is a picture of a dorm where students press on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how insufficient sleep affects athletic performance and the importance of the bedtime routine.
In another part, participants learn about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know — just as you have a right to know about the health effects when you choose to smoke a cigarette,” said Professor Cheysler.
A culture of pride in “working all night” still exists, he said, and besides, modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
To have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student’s “secret weapon” in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even to avoid obesity, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond Sow, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheysler design the course after attending one of his classes last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act for a course throughout the student city.
He hopes the next step is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Chysler recommended that students consider setting an alarm about when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted from electronic screens and LED light, which shifts the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's goal knocked down Gerard's men
The Rangers suffered another devastating, sad day when Dolly Menga's strike sent Steven Gerard's team to a 1–0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first win since the February 4–1 triumph at St Johnston, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving their team eight points behind the runaway leading team Harts in the Scottish First League.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers line-up lost inspiration and chances for a draw.
Now the Rangers have fallen to sixth place, and Livingston have climbed to third and are just behind Hibernian by goal difference.
There may be additional problems waiting for Rangers after line judge Callum Spence had to receive medical attention for a head injury after being apparently hit by a distant object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that beat Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same 11 Livingstons who scored a point with Harts last week and would have been delighted with the way his well-trained line-up stifled opponents at every opportunity.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball than they did.
They were due to score a point, two minutes after Menga's first loss pushed Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the chance.
Then a long-range strike by Kehan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halket, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only play openly in the defense.
The Rangers managed to control the game, but there seemed to be more hope than belief in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should get a penalty in the 15th minute when he and Stephen Lawles clashed, but Judge Steven Thomson did not give a sign of approval to the Colombian's appeal.
The Rangers only managed two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goaltender Liam Kelly didn't get tired of Lasana Coulibaly's head-butt and Ovi Edaria's weak kick.
Although the start of the 34th minute of Livingston may have been the opposite of the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it according to their game.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with Jacobs' blow.
Scott Alfred did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who cold-headedly chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerard reacted during the halftime when he replaced Koulabali with Ryan Kent, and the substitution had a quick impact when the winger overtook Morelos, but the impressive Kelly reacted from his line with a blockage.
But Livingston managed to attract guest players to play the type of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Hackett catching many of the long passes.
Holt's team could have extended the lead towards the end of the game, but McGregor set well and prevented Jacobs from playing head-to-head.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, had another penalty request after clashing with Jacobs, but Thomson again disapproved.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our almanac "On Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and we are counting ... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has become a mainstay of popular culture, as in the 1950 film The Bells of Colorado, starring the seemingly inconclusive, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that again?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put the headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms releasing radioactivity into the minerals.”
Evans: "Say, it's bound to jump now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name still exists.
New cancer vaccine could teach immune system to ‘see’ stray cells
New cancer vaccine could teach immune system to ‘see’ stray cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognize stray cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory
They can “see” a protein common in many types of cancer, and then be returned to the body
The trial vaccine offers promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
In a woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize stray cells, ovarian cancer disappeared in 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory, so that they can "see" a protein common in many types of cancer called HER2, and then returning them to the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that promises a lot.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach by extracting immune cells from patients and “learning” them how to target cancer cells works in treating a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West made a pro-Trump outburst, wearing a cap with his motto, after performing Saturday night live.
That didn't go well.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio during a live show on Saturday night, after a useless performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After the performance of the third song that night, called City of Ghosts, wearing a cap that read “Make America Famous Again,” he began to criticize Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“When I talk to a white man, they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
“If I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
The Saturday night live show began with a satire with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, related to allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not aired, a recording of West's outburst was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the post.
West also complained to the audience that he had a hard time behind the scenes because of his cap.
I was laughed at behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't show up with that hat."
They made fun of me!
Then I was told that I was in a sinking place, he said, according to Washington Exeminer.
West continued, "Do you want to see the sinking place?" he said he would "put his Superman cap on, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?"
“Try with love.”
His comments drew controversy from the audience on at least two occasions, and the cast of the evening show looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one man saying of the publisher: "The whole studio's on hiatus."
The news was brought in as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many with a performance of the song "I Want It", dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from the leader of the conservative TPSAD group, Candice Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU for standing up to the crowd."
But the show's host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West "was his own and that's absolutely wonderful".
“But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or their clothes or supporting their ‘art’) that I believe embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
“So do we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, with him now "formally known as Kaine West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puff Daddy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg is named Snoop Lyon and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist from previously known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder in Belfast restaurant stabbing
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after stabbing a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Balihakmor, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast High Court on Monday.
The charges will be heard by the Attorney General.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington has attacked toxic masculinity.
Keith Harrington is known for his role as a skilled swordsman as Jon Snow in the violent, medieval, fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, attacked the macho hero stereotype when he said that such on-screen roles mean that young boys often feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to the Sunday Times culture section, Keith said he believed “something is wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #SegaI say era.
Keith, who recently married Game of Thrones star Rosie Leslie, also 31, admitted he had "strong feelings" about the matter.
“Personally, I have strong feelings, at the moment – where did we go wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach men when they grow up about the problems we see now?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, thanks to strong male characters.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is learned?
What is learned from TV, and what on the street, what makes young boys feel that they must have a certain side of masculinity?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time – how do we change that?
“There’s something wrong with young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in Game of Thrones sequels when the series ends next summer, saying he "ended up with battles and horses".
From November, Keith will perform in Sam Shepard's True West revival, which is the story of a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks meeting his wife Rose is the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so in a way she gave me my future family and my life in the future,” he said.
Rose played Igrith, a character who had a love interest with Keith's character, John Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 are covered in the country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases were transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of those living with HIV and AIDS in China grew by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because of the conservative values of the country, research shows that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are due to inadequate sexual protection in those relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters has denied the data, which was provided by a staff member linked to a Republican senator, as "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff published the personal information of three Republican senators in the United States on the pages of lawmakers on Wikipedia.
The Democrat from Los Angeles assured that the claims are of "ultra-right" sympathizers and websites.
“Lies, lies, and even more hideous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly includes the home address and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill while the Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to be a Supreme Court justice, was ongoing.
The revelations came shortly after Kavanaugh was questioned by three senators.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and Redstate reported that the IP address identifying the source of the announcement was linked to Waters’ office and information about a Waters staff member was released.
"These unfortunate allegations are completely false and constitute an absolute lie," Waters said.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of those false and false allegations – is in no way responsible for the information provided.
“The allegations are completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“These denials are nerve-wracking,” Fleischer wrote.
“This shows that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
It must not be provoked.
He must not question the motives of the accuser.
He needs to stay calm and calm.”
Fletcher seems to have compared Waters’ reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused by critics of looking too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also took to Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s a big deal,” he wrote on Twitter.
In a statement, Waters said her office had informed “the relevant institutions and police of the false allegations.
“We will allow offenders to be identified,” she continued, “and will be legally responsible for all of their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all members of my staff.”
Johnny English's Opinion Attacks Again - Undermining Rowan Atkinson's Spy Fraud
It’s now traditional to look for elements of Brexit in every new film with a British connection, and that seems to apply to this renewal of the rogue, action-comedy Johnny English franchise – which began in 2003 with Johnny English and replayed in 2011 with Johnny English: Born Again.
Will careful self-pity on the subject of how obviously we are screwed up be the nation’s new export opportunity?
Despite this, the big-eyed, incompetent Johnny English’s face was licensed to “shut up” things for the second time—his name above all indicates that he is a wide-ranging comic creation, made for cinemagoers in places where English is not spoken.
He is, of course, a sketch of a secret agent who, despite his bizarre efforts at careful glamour, bears a bit of a resemblance to Clouseau, features Mr. Bean, and part of the boy playing a note of the song "Cochie on Fire" from the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Its basis is the traveler and mysterious international man Atkinson who once starred in the now-forgotten Barclays TV commercial, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two moments in the latest edition of Johnny English.
I liked it very much when Johnny English approaches a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor blades hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy can be seen, but the humor seems weak and somewhat superficial, especially since "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves contain elements of comedy.
The humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English’s crazy misadventures are not as inventive and focused as the silent stunts of Atkinson’s character Bean.
The problem is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker infiltrates a super secret network of spies in Britain, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the disappointment of the agent on duty – a disappointingly small role for Kevin Eldon.
In the last chance for a prime minister who is a pompous and combative figure and already suffers from a complete melting of political unpopularity: Emma Thomson is doing her best in this quasi-Therese-May character, but there is nothing special in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling up Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a private school, but “in black” gives secret agent classes: there are a few good guys here, when English offers a spy school that resembles a rock academy.
English is quickly summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former collaborator Bowe, played by Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, in a relationship with a submarine commander, a comic role in which Vicky Pepperdine is not well used.
Well, Batman and Robin, for screwing up everything in the Royal Secret Service, are back in action and meet the fatally beautiful Ophelia Buletova, a character played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls under the dangerous influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their odyssey of absurd procedures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they make havoc after smuggling themselves onto a luxury Volta yacht; and English begins a veritable anarchy when he tries to use the virtual reality helmet to get to know the Volta inside.
All the brakes have been removed for the last sequence, but as polite and noisy as it is, there is plenty of children's TV throughout the film.
Nice moderate stuff.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can’t help but think: can’t the British film industry cast Rowan Atkinson as the one who will use his talent?
Labour says they plan to work four days a week but get paid five days a week
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would see Britons working four days a week – but getting paid for five.
The party reportedly wants CEOs to use the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give workers another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend – but would take the same paycheck.
According to sources, the idea "corresponds" to the party's economic agenda and plans to make the country more favourable to workers.
The shift to a four-day workweek is supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A senior party member told The Sunday Times: "A review of the strategy should be published before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a drive that is consistent with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to embrace such an idea, with the Green Party pushing for a four-day working week during the 2017 parliamentary election campaign.
However, the aspiration is not accepted by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not a party strategy and the party is not considering such an idea."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to present his vision for a socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to seize the power of "faceless directors" and "profiters" in utility firms.
The chancellor’s shadow plans also mean current shareholders in water companies may not get the full share back because the Labour government could make “deductions” for unethical behavior.
He also confirmed plans for workers to become part of the company’s boards and create Inclusive Property Funds so that 10 percent of the capital of private firms will go to employees, who can take an annual dividend of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John F. Kennedy give a statement about “60 Minutes” on whether the FBI’s Kavanaugh investigation can change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question of whether the bureau’s findings could consider some Republican senators withdrawing support.
In an interview published Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more outspoken than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I think so,” Kennedy said.
“I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was firm, decisive, unequivocal.”
Graham’s voice, however, looks carved into stone.
"My decision has been made for Brett Kavanaugh and a shocking indictment is needed," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it vigorously,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“Everyone she named could not confirm it.
That's 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be held the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring famous stars and has an impressive mission; an end to poverty.
Now held for the seventh time, the Global Citizen Festival will be visited by tens of thousands of people who will come to the large lawn in the central park, not only to enjoy performances by names like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of ending poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the project against global poverty, an international activist group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless they want to pay for a VIP ticket), participants must complete several tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call, or some other useful work that will help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is the Goalie Citizen because there are 12 years left to achieve the whole thing?
Is the idea of a free concert the right way to convince people to demand something or just another case of “click-activism” – people who feel they make a real difference by signing a petition online or sending a message on Twitter?
As of 2011, Global Citizen claimed to have registered more than 19 million "activities" from supporters, who acted for many different purposes.
They say these activities have helped inspire world leaders to herald a commitment and strategy that has raised more than $37 billion and that will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 promises and hints resulting from their activities, of which $10 billion has already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds raised have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key pledges are the UK-based Power of Food, a partnership of investors and implementers dedicated to “helping children reach their potential,” which has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help tackle undernourishment in the country after receiving 4,700 Twitter messages from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition, a record in history," Ambassador Tracy Ullman of the Power of Nutrition told a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said over 5,000 actions were taken related to calls to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in Britain, the government announced funding for the project, The Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of their website’s frequently asked questions, “Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult road – we will never succeed.
But like the great civil and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborah-Lee Fournes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. may use naval blockade to block Russian energy exports: Interior Ministry
Washington could use the navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinki said on Monday.
According to Zinki, Russia’s involvement in Syria – namely, where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government – is a front for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because of the energy trade, just as they are doing in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe,” he said.
And according to the government official, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, with a blockade, to prevent their energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinki addressed the audience at an event organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group that presents itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that it is effectively the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, raising the stakes and replacing fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as an "inconvenient pony" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statement came after the Trump administration launched a mission to boost liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to back away from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline should double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is only an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s firm opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that customers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position met with resistance from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States not to interfere in European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third party interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kemp, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren ‘will carefully consider’ whether to run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "carefully consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our dysfunctional government, which means a woman at the helm,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will carefully consider whether to run for president.”
Warren praised President Donald Trump’s work during a meeting in the city hall and said he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is open about her criticism of Trump and the man he nominates to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released Thursday showed that a large number of voters in her constituency think she should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey by the Suffolk University/Boston Globe Center for Policy Research.
Thirty-two percent support such a candidate.
The poll showed more support for the nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential nomination and 48 percent opposed.
Other well-known Democratic names under discussion for the 2020 nomination include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would formally decide by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after signing up in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through since he came back, I know how the other families who are torn apart by the post-traumatic stress disorder and the wounds our soldiers are coming back with are feeling,” she told an audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest an "elephant in the room" and said her son and other military veterans "are coming back a little different, they're coming back fortified, they're coming back and wondering if there's any respect for what they and their Air Force comrades, and every other member of the military gave for the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence by assaulting a woman, along with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a police spokesman in Wasila.
18 U.S. states and the city of Washington support challenging new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the city of Washington are backing a challenge to a new U.S. policy that prevents victims fleeing domestic or gang violence from being granted asylum.
Representatives from 18 states and the city of Washington filed a petition with the amicus curiae court in Washington on Friday in support of an asylum seeker who is contesting the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Parliament, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" abused her, but U.S. authorities rejected her asylum application on July 20.
He was imprisoned in Texas.
The attorney general, representing Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many of the U.S. asylum claims originated, as nations with persistent gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturns a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington D.C. Attorney General Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international lawmaking."
“Federal law requires that all asylum claims be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a provision violates that principle,” according to the petition to the court (amicus curiae).
In addition, advocates in the letter argue that policies that prevent immigrants from entering are harmful to the U.S. economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs “to offer the necessary labor.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"There is asylum for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a June 11 policy presentation.
Asylum has never been conceived as a solution to all the problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that people all over the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts are underway in Palu as the death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
“It’s very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she comforted her male baby at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
“There is no clean water.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes and choose from their watered objects to save what they can.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dui Harris, who has fractures to his back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside, due to frequent subsequent minor earthquakes.
Tears came to his eyes as he described the powerful earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was pinned down in the rubble of the wall, I think,” Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife asking for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and the kid.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of ‘bullying’ with ‘propaganda ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily listing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. media to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump spoke last Wednesday about China Daily’s paid supplement in the De Moin Register – Iowa’s best-selling newspaper – after accusing China of interfering in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, China dismissed the accusation.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked a merger of U.S. services with Reuters, a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it’s normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a trade war in which they flatten each other’s import tariffs.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war targeted exporters from states such as Iowa that support Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts confirmed.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing was hurting U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the weekly edition of the De Moin Register, "now doubles the harassment of propaganda ads in our free press."
“In the de-semination of propaganda, the Chinese government is abusing the cherished American tradition of free speech and free media by placing advertisements in the De Moin Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in a nearby newspaper booth here in Beijing, you can only find a limited number of posts and you will not see a true reflection of the desperate opinions that the Chinese people may have about China’s troubled economic trajectory, because the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party’s hard-line hand,” he wrote.
He added that "one of the most widely read newspapers in China rejected his offer to publish" the column, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans are moving away from women's votes ahead of midterm elections over the Kavanaugh debacle, analysts have warned.
With many Republicans silently watching or defending Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court despite several sexual assault allegations, analysts warn there will be negative consequences, especially from women in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already said they want to proceed with the vote.
Of such things there is no turning back,” wrote Grant Richer, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, for Hill, in a column published on Saturday.
Richer said he doubted pressure from the FBI to investigate Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) would be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday — they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November,” Karin Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” at a protest in the Senate hallway when Republicans, who have control of the legal affairs committee, decided to proceed with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats will be high,” Stu Rotenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
“People already say they’re tall; that’s true.
But they can be higher, especially between independent female voters in the suburbs and young voters, ages 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against a Supreme Court justice candidate, analysts suggest there could be negative consequences if Republicans continue to vote.
"This has become a major mess for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the last vote or whether Kavanaugh will go to a hearing, it’s also about the way Republicans handled this and how they treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
Still, Americans are divided over who to trust after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, though more accept the first-mentioned side.
A new survey by Yu-Gow shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying in his testimony, while only 30 percent thought the same about Ford.
"Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one others, against Deborah Ramirez," the Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, under oath, last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez accuses the Supreme Court justice candidate of showing her genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch new internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup business that claims to be a rival to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrapt, is a company built on Berners-Lee's open-source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's intention was "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said of the start-up business.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “data warehouse online” or POD for short.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available on one browser at a time.
What is unique about the personal data warehouse on the Internet is that it is up to the user who has access to a certain type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrapt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is for the company to provide resources, process, and appropriate skills for Solid to be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, several developers with a contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrapt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete overhaul where their business models are completely turned upside down overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrapt’s mission is to enable commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based network.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an influential spokesperson on the Internet’s neutrality debate.
Even with Inrapt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about the new era of the internet,” Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Van: Famous Victorian cross bearer of the First World War
The only Anglican priest to receive the Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighter has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel, Honorary Bernard Van received the acknowledgment on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Belenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had received the highest British military decoration.
A commemorative stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "incredible symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from cannons and machine guns".
He later ran to the firing range and advanced with "greatest courage" before attacking the cannon nest himself and disabling three of the servers.
Colonel Wang was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's works were "something I know I'll never be able to fulfill, but it's something that makes us humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Van also laid a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Youth Imperial Band.
Michael Van said it was "a great honor to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown by the support that will be given by many people".
Combined Martial Arts fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead getting Peppa Pig
Imagine being up all night watching Bellator 206 and not being able to watch the main event.
The San Jose roster contained 13 fights, including six with the main card that aired live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gerard Musassi and Rory McDonald were getting ready to face off, viewers in Britain were horrified when the canal switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after staying awake until the early hours because of the struggle.
One Twitter fan described the switch to a children’s cartoon as “some sick joke.”
“The law is that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to a children’s program,” Dave Schwartz, Belator’s vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the broadcast.
Peppa Pig, yes.
Bellator president Scott Cooker said he would work on a schedule that would include viewers from Britain in the future.
“I think when I think about re-release, I think we can probably find a solution,” Kuker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday and we won’t be able to find a solution on Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, we received a lot of messages during the transfer and none of them were kind.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't, it was a legal issue.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We will limit the number of fights to five, instead of six – as we usually do – we tried to deliver more because of the fans and we overreacted.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Discs on a deserted island: Tom Daley felt “inferior” because of sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daly says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he went to high school that “everyone is not like me.”
Speaking at the first Discs on a Desert Island show on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running show Kirsty Young took a multi-month vacation due to illness.
Appearing as a supporting character in Laverne's first program, Daly said he felt "less" than anyone else growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to have sympathy for boys and girls."
He said, “To this day, those feelings of inferiority and diversity were the things that gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove he was “something,” he said, so he wouldn’t disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medalist has become a well-known supporter of LGBT campaigns and has used his performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without division and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man — American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 — “surprised me.”
Daley married the Oscar-winning actor, who is 20 years older, last year, but said the age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so much at an early age" - he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and depths.
The two became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said "all his views" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about 'I should win a gold medal,'" he said.
“You know what, there are more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie.
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept dying and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to London 2012 – because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You're not going to be here to be in the front row,'" he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died I finally realized he was invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew this was what I’d dreamed of all my life – jumping in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there’s no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song, "Pride of Heather Small", which came to mind in the run-up to the Olympics and which he still resented.
Discs on a deserted island on BBC Radio 4 is on Sunday at 11:15 UK summer time.
Mickelson, the horse is not in shape, was on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
Phil Mickelson is set to set a record Sunday when he plays in the 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to change shape to avoid an unfortunate turnaround.
Michelson, who played at the biennial event for a record 12th time, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furik during Saturday's doubles and quads.
Instead of being the center of attention, as the five-time winner often represents the United States, he split the time to cheer and practice on his game, on the range, in the hope of fixing what silenced him.
Never the best leader, even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal choice for the tight Le Golf National, where distant rough strokes are a regular punishment for negligence.
And if the pitch itself isn’t intimidating enough, Mikkelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces British Open precision champion Francesco Molinari, who is paired with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points short before 12 individual matches, start off hard, the Mikkelson game can be crucial.
Furik expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see anything else.
“He fully understood the role he had today, touched my back and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furik said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is one of the celebrities and has given a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I can’t imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but it went like this and we thought we had to do it.
He wants to play like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career where he never achieved the best results in his individual career.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furik said his presence brings something intangible to the team.
He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s witty, he likes to joke with people and he’s a great guy at team meetings.”
“I think the younger players were having fun playing with him, like this week, which was fun to watch.
It’s more than just a game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead before individual matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable position.
The Dane made his debut at a game in Valderrama in 1997, when the guy led by Steve Balesteros had a lead of five points ahead of the Americans, but "crossed the finish line only with the noses", with the smallest lead of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I remind myself that we had a great lead in Walderham; we had a great lead in Brooklyn, when we lost and in Walderham, when we almost won,” said Bjorn, pictorially, after watching the 2018 class win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday with a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Get ready for tomorrow.
Go out and play it right.
This isn’t over until the game is over.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy and the focus remains on that.
I say all the time, I’m focusing on the 12 players on our team, but we’re fully aware of the opposing side – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn added: "I'm pleased with the results of his players on the heavy golf course: 'I don't want to give premature grades on this issue.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
We’re going to have a game tomorrow, and that’s a different matter.
It’s great to play with a partner when things are going well, but when you play individually, then all the abilities as a golfer are tested.
That’s the message that needs to be sent to the players, to give their best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to do his best.”
Unlike Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn, opponent Jim Furik will require players to play better individually than they played in doubles, with the exceptions being Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furik himself was on both ends of the changes on the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up a loser when Europe performed The Miracle of Medina.
"I remember every word there was," he said when asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, united the players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to start like we did at the last start we saw in Brooklyn, like we did in Medina.
When the momentum goes in a certain direction, it brings a lot of pressure to the middle matches.
We set the line accordingly and the order of the team is based on how we feel, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was given the task of confronting Rory McLroy first and facing the most important match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter with the other Europeans in the most important half of the sequence.
"I decided to play this way with the guys because I think that's how we're going to cover everything," Bjorn said of the selection in the individual games.
The new German warship has been delayed again.
The German Navy’s latest frigate was due to be delivered in 2014 to replace outdated Cold War-era warships, but that won’t happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising prices, local media reported.
The delivery of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the flagship of the new class of frigates Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the troubled issues after delivery hampered the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that they will contain a powerful cannon, a large number of anti-aircraft weapons and naval missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic trace.
Among other important features is less maintenance - it should be possible, the latest frigates, to be absent up to two years from domestic ports.
However, the constant delays mean that modern warships — which should allow Germany to wield power across the oceans — will be obsolete by the time they enter service, Di Zeit notes.
The F125's ill-fated frigate made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to take the ship back to the Blom and Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key "software and hardware defects" that rendered the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important because the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships would have a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is drastically above the planned weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The Rhineland-Palatinate weighs 7,000 tons and is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by Germany in World War II.
Aside from the problematic hardware, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – also became an issue.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – an increase from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems faced by the latest frigates are particularly important because of warnings about Germany’s declining naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, confirmed that the navy was "missing ships that can be deployed".
The official said the problem has worsened over time, as older ships have been withdrawn from service but no replacement ships have been provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class could join the navy.
The National Trust eavesdrops on the secret life of bats
A new survey of property in the Scottish Highlands is being conducted to find out how bats are using the area in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will provide answers to the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
A study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano bats, as well as brown long-eared bats and doubenton bats at Inverow Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
N.H.S. staff and volunteers will also carry mobile research using handheld detectors.
Expert analysis of the sounds from all recordings will determine the frequency depending on the type of bats.
A habitat map will then be drawn up to create a detailed picture of their behavior in the area.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at NBC, hopes the results will reveal which areas of life are most important to bats and how they use each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and Britain have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affect litters and habitat loss.
Windmills and lights also pose risks, as do fly duct tape and some chemical treatments on building materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
Bats aren't actually blind.
However, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to find insects and obstacles in the flight path.
N.T.S., which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land in the state, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, bed inspections, and sometimes rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at Triv Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
Property manager David Thomson says the property is an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Triv we have a great bat area," he said.
“We have old buildings, very old two and very good housing.
But there are a lot of unknowns about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us learn more about what they need to thrive.”
He stressed that it is important to check whether there are bats before renovating properties, because the unconscious destruction of litters can destroy up to 400 females and cubs, and destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or disturb or destroy their litters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Bat Protection Trust, encourages the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and our other species, we just don’t know how they live.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations, lawyers sue German magazine <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations “fake news” and added that people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are suing the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman, Catherine Mayorga, at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were made, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "fake news".
“No, no, no, no, no.
What was brought out today is fake news," the five-time Golden Ball winner told his camera.
“They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added, laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called an "unacceptable transfer of private life suspicions", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Scherz said the player would seek damages for "moral damage in addition to an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the offense, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years".
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed with the court in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was a "99 percent" "good boy" but fell below the "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had had sex, but that there was consent.
Mayorga also claimed that she went to the police and pictures were taken of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to a settlement without judicial participation because she was afraid of reprisals" and was concerned "that she would be publicly disgraced".
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to renegotiate the agreement because of trauma from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack occurred and this summer moved to Italian giant Juventus with a deal worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK will ‘always regret’ losing carmakers
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will “always regret” losing its status as the world’s leading carmaker after Brexit, business minister Greg Clarke said on Wednesday.
He added that it was “worrying” that Toyota-Britain had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at a factory in Burnaston, close to Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant — which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis — produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be a production shutdown at our factory,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s managing director in Burnaston.
Other carmakers in Britain have voiced concerns about how cross-border trade would work if the EU leaves without a deal, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini-factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call risks to the logistics chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a "just-in-time" system, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU, for cars on order.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a border break that the industry says could cause delays and shortfalls in parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than a daily inventory at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely made to avoid such border checks".
"We need to have a deal. We need to have the best deal that will not only give us success that we will enjoy in the present, but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The evidence not only from Toyota but other manufacturers is that we must be able to continue what is a very successful set of logistics chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and cost jobs.
Peter Tsuvalaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a union representative at the factory, said that its members are increasingly concerned: “My experience is that once those jobs are gone, they will never come back.
According to a government spokesman: "We have drawn up a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as the battle over Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election meddling, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and the president’s potential violation of the law.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thus jeopardize Mueller’s independence has fueled gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was considering wearing a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But with the release of the reports last Monday, he went to the White House with the intention of resigning.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he "would not like" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed in order to avoid a clash at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a week-long investigation by the FBI into the Kavanaugh lawsuits, which would further delay the Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date for the meeting has not yet been set, it could take place this week, and it could be postponed for another week, given all the things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see how things go, and I always try to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists dispute the claim: Sanders has not given a briefing to reporters at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the small number of briefings was not due to a lack of "great influence" from television journalists, though he added: "I would agree with the fact that they have a great influence."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president is organizing more Q&A sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We've looked at those numbers."
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to directly question the president of the United States, that’s far better than talking to me.
We are trying to do it more often, and you are witnesses that we have done it repeatedly over the past few weeks, and talks with the President of the United States will replace briefings for journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting senior officials.
Rarely participates in independent press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why this is the case with his uncontrollable and sometimes bizarre appearances in front of the assembled journalists.
Health Secretary with a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland’s national health system on Brexit fears
The Health Secretary wrote a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland’s national health system expressing the country’s gratitude and desire for them to remain after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, a Scottish MP, sent the letter less than six months before the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the cost of resolved status applications for EU citizens working in public services at a lower level.
Ms Freeman wrote in her letter: “The UK-EU withdrawal negotiations continued throughout the summer, with the aim of taking the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up preparations for the possibility of no deal.
I know this is a very upsetting time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the workforce, regardless of his citizenship.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and are of value to the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering head injury
Christion Abercrombie, the Tennessee State Tigers' linebacker, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday when the team lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline of the playground and just collapsed to the ground," Reid said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen off the pitch, then placed him in a stretcher and took him for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/degree of injury" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury actually occurred.
Abecrombi is a second-year student and plays his first season in a red jersey at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He made a total of five knockouts on Saturday before retiring from the game, resulting in a total of 18 knockouts this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the UK
Under Tory’s new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the UK, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters.
A higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The ministry expects this move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year, funds that will be used to help homeless people.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the UK, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
The move would be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters with his promises to provide affordable housing and focus on high-income earners.
A higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay tax in the UK, with additional funds to step up the government’s efforts to improve the situation of homeless people.
The additional amount, which in addition to the current administrative fee includes the higher levels that were introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of property with the intention of renting it, can reach up to three percent.
The ministry expects the move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120m a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built properties in London were purchased by non-UK residents, leading to price increases and causing difficulties for first-time homebuyers to engage in the process.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially the capital, have become ghost towns due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was announced just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of offering high prices on land-holding properties but not using them and asked Mrs May to change the quotas on affordable homes in order to remedy the “shameful housing situation” in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and ending evictions without just cause.
He also wants to give councils more authority to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right for people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to be able to buy homes in the same easy way as hardworking British residents.
The dream of owning your own home has become too distant for many people, and the humiliation of the homeless too real.”
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate ambition is to govern Scotland’
Jack Ross, head of Sunderland, said his "ultimate ambition" was to become manager of Scotland's national club in the future.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of reviving a club in the northeast that currently sits third in the Premier League with just three points less than the club at the top.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that was it," Ross told the BBC's Scottish Sportsound.
“But I grew up constantly watching Scotland at Hampden with my father and there was always something pulling me back.
But I can only do that if I’m successful in managing the club.”
Some of Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Pojet, and Paulo Di Ca<0xC3><0xB1>io.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he did not feel any anxiety knowing he should follow such established names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“My success at the moment is measured by ‘can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Given the structure and facilities at this club, he undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get this club there, but I’ll probably think that I’ve achieved success here only if I bring the club back there.”
Ross worked as a manager for only three years, a career he entered after working as an assistant to the boss at Dumbarton and after a 15-month engagement as part of the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third division and brought St. Mirren back from the brink of losing the Championship title the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he played in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real crossroads for me,” he recalls of taking on Alloa.
“I honestly believed that a career as a manager was the right choice for me, a better choice than a career as a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, I made enough money from it and enjoyed certain high privileges.
But building a career as a player can be really hard.
There are a lot of things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
I still go through certain things in terms of stress and pressure from work, but I just feel good in the role of manager.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now I do, in this role I feel more comfortable than ever throughout my adult life.”

According to one study, the perfect time for a beer is 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in profits for British pubs, which are currently in a very difficult situation, but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurant profits fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA’s business consulting firm, said: “Sunny weather and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Cup meant the situation in July was similar to that in June, when pub profits rose 2.8 percent and restaurant profits dropped significantly.
The decline in restaurant sales of 1.8 percent in June further worsened during July.
Pubs and bars where drinks are mostly sold have seen a much larger increase compared to previous years compared to restaurants where there has been a decline.
Pubs where food was mostly sold were also badly affected by the sunny periods, though not as dramatically as restaurant owners.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and food sales by just three percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s holiday and hospitality analyst, said: “These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling on the market outside the home.
It’s no surprise that restaurants remain in a difficult situation, though a 4.8 percent drop in sales over a year would be particularly striking in addition to the ongoing cost pressures.
The long warm summer could not have come at a worse time for the owners of the locals where food is mostly sold, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide much needed rest."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a stalemate in the release of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which tracks sales in the UK’s pubs, bars and restaurants sector, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with combined revenues of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is an established benchmark for the industry.
One in five children have a secret social media profile that they keep hidden from their parents.
One study found that one in five children, some as young as 11, has a secret social media profile that they keep hidden from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 high school students found a rise in the number of “fake Instagram” accounts.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted on such accounts.
Twenty percent of students said they had one “master” profile that they showed their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, creates a social media profile that they keep hidden from adults.
The survey, which included 20,000 high school students, showed a rapid rise in the number of “fake Insta” profiles, an abbreviation for the Instagram website where photos are shared.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted on such accounts.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clear “master” profile that they showed to their parents, and they also had other private profiles.
A mother who accidentally found the secret profile of her 13-year-old daughter came across a teenager asking others to “rape him.”
A survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in independent schools found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them admitted that one of them is secret.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s really disturbing that so many teens are tempted to create online profiles where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Elid Doyle will be the “voice of the athletes” on the board of Scottish Athletics
Elid Doyle was elected non-executive director of the board of Scottish Athletics at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete and President Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for those who are part of the sport’s leadership to take advantage of her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Everyone in the Scottish, British and world athletic community has tremendous respect for Elis and we are confident that athletes in Scotland would benefit tremendously if she became a board member,” Beatty said.
Doyle said: "I am ready to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games, in addition to winning a total of four Olympic gold medals and who now appears regularly as a BBC commentator, was unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I will recover or to what extent.
The whole process was exhausting, but I managed to fully recover, I can go again and do agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
Breast pump ad in which mothers are compared to cows caused a division of opinion on the Internet
A breast pump company caused a split on the internet when it released an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s hottest breast pump,” user-oriented technology company Elvie has released a funny ad inspired by music videos to showcase the freedom the new pump offers breastfeeding mothers.
Four mothers dance in a cow barn full of hay to a song whose lyrics are: “Yes, I milk the milk, but you can’t see the tail” and “If you haven’t noticed these are not named, these are my breasts.”
The chorus continues: “Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, suck my breasts.”
However, the ad, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it highlighted the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They, like us, need to get pregnant and give birth so that they can produce milk, except for the fact that their children are stolen from them just a few days after they give birth," reads one of the comments.
Elvie's breast pump fits discreetly into the breastfeeding bra ("Elvie"/"Mother")
Another comment read: “It is understandable that this is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?”
Someone else added, “Really inappropriate advertising.”
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was really "ridiculous."
“I think this idea is genius.
I'd buy a pump like this if I was still breastfeeding.
It made me feel like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
“It’s a great product,” said one commenter.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad designed for mothers who milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like 'cows.'
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were dancing while discreet pumps were peed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use milk pumps say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, there are no wires, no tubes, and it discreetly fits into the breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even leave the house while milking.
Anna Balarin, partner and DDR at Mother commented: “Elvie’s pump is a truly revolutionary product and deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between milk-smokers and dairy cows, we wanted to make milk-smokers with a pump and the challenges that come with putting it in the spotlight, while showing the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump brings in a fun and closer way.
This isn’t the first time that Elvie’s pump has been featured in all titles.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski wearing the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children in custody has increased significantly, although border crossings on a monthly basis have remained relatively unchanged, in part due to the fact that harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to accommodate children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors were themselves undocumented immigrants and feared endangering their own stay in the country if they asked to sponsor a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors illegally reside in the country and a large proportion of them are foreigners with criminal records.
That's why we continue to prosecute these individuals," Mr. Albens said.
In order to speed up the processing of children, authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than within 60 days, as shelter workers say was the previous standard.
Many of them will appear via a conference video call, rather than in person, in order to bring their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit to receive relief will be immediately deported.
The longer children stay in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempted escapes, say shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where its size makes it more likely to ignore signs that a child is facing difficulties.
They added that moving the children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could increase the trauma most of them already face.
Syria tells U.S., French and Turkish “occupying forces” to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally stationed in Syria on the pretext that they were taking part in the fight against terrorism and "will be dealt with appropriately."
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he told the assembly.
Muallem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to wage this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territory" from the two terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom are training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on its war-torn territory.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem said conditions were good for them to return and accused "some from Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They are politicising an issue that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive reconstruction aid until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
However, Muallem stressed that the deal had "clear timelines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed at jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who "will be eradicated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Muallem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "considering the members of the current constitution," and warned of the consequences of further meddling in it.
Why Trump will win a second term
By that logic, Mr. Trump will win again in the 2020 election unless impeachment and scandal prematurely end his presidential term, as many liberals probably hope.
In what will no doubt be the “Most Dramatic Presidency Finale Ever Seen!”
As seen from now on, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the ratings in prime time have more than doubled to reach 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to reach 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Nielsen says Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the prime time, up 1.7 million from four years ago, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show reached the top cable ratings with about 3.5 million viewers on the evenings when important news is reported.
“It’s like a fire that people feel drawn to because it’s not something that we understand,” said Neil Baer, the ABC’s chief television producer of the drama “Designated Survivor,” for a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol is destroyed by an attack.
Nell Scovel, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
“He said, ‘Because I think it’s really funny,’” Ms. Scovel told me.
There's a certain amount of fun in all the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade case, whether immigrant families can be reunited, and the well-being of the global economy.
Exclusion from all this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you’re no longer an uninformed citizen when you’ve been watching a panel of experts for six hours debating Bob Woodward’s use of the “deep background” source for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-jacket bomber.
I will never be able to watch Super Mario in the same way.
“Part of what he does and what makes you feel like you’re watching a reality show is that every night brings you something new,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars for the rotating crew of the Trump show and the daily twists and turns (fights with the NFL, praises to the NFL).
You can’t afford to miss an episode because you won’t be able to make up for it afterwards.
When I visited Mr. Fleiss this week it was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was indoors watching MSNBC while he was filming on CNN.
He couldn’t stop looking, at least not when Brett Kavanaugh was due to face the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was in critical condition.
"I remember doing all those crazy shows in the past and people saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

The influx of external funds in the tightest midterm elections in the race for the upper house
Unsurprisingly, the 17th congressional district in Pennsylvania is receiving a large amount of funding thanks to the reorganization of the congressional districts, from which there are two candidates in the race for the same seat.
This recently reconstructed suburban area in Pittsburgh is run by Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another area in a snap election last spring.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th congressional district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th congressional district.
The maps were changed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old areas were being manipulated in favor of Republicans, in violation of the constitution.
The race in the new 17th congressional district is a tough competition to fund campaigns between the major party sponsors, the Democratic Party's (DCCC) Congressional Campaign Committee, and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the early election for the 18th congressional district in March that was characterized by widespread media coverage.
For more than a decade, the seat was held by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the area by a margin of 20 points.
Political experts give Democrats a small advantage.
The United States decided to punish El Salvador for supporting China, and then gave up
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out the Trump organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama based on "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore," State Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But only El Salvador was penalized, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have a damaging impact on the country in Central America and high unemployment and murder rates there.
As internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to hold a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants heading toward the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials stressed they wanted the conference to move forward and put an effective end to any consideration of punishing El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is due to address a conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attributes to the gathering, diplomats said.
The three U.S. officials quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of heavy messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their views were supported by an external analyst close to the administration who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn History
The next thing that could happen is the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, for which there is currently very strong evidence in public records.
Mr. Miller reportedly also directs his investigation to the fact that Mr. Trump’s campaign is associated with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the composition of Congress changes, Mr. Trump will have to take responsibility in that body as he prepares to appear again before voters, and possibly before a jury composed of his colleagues.
There are a lot of uncertainties here, and I don’t want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable, nor that of his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic should make certain choices that will affect the duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed to do so and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of change, and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing several such points of change.
What will we do if Mr. Trump resigns as Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the hot seat since the newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly filming the president and speculated that he was unfit for the job he was doing.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in The Times is incorrect.
“What would we do if Brett Kavanaugh’s new investigation requested by the FBI was incomplete or unfair, or if he proved his innocence before the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will blame Mr. Trump?
If we fail all these tests, democracy is in for a long winter.
But I believe that this will not happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light candles for the Sabbath table with a swastika logo.
With a legacy like this, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Graham Dorans of the Rangers with an optimistic attitude before the clash with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers hosted a clash with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, aware of the fact that after a draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, a victory over the Austrians would solidify their position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
Graham Dorence, a midfield player due to a knee injury, was prevented from appearing in the season until a 2–2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a stepping stone to greater achievement.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old said.
“We came into the game believing that we could achieve something and we came back with a point.
Maybe we could have given a little more in the end, but the draw was probably also a fair result.
They were better in the first half and we did our best in the second half and we were better.
On Thursday, we have another big night.
I hope that we will win three points, but it will be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but I am sure that with the support of the fans we will return and get a positive result.
“Last year was definitely a difficult year given everything that has happened, my injuries and the changes at the club, but now there is a positive factor about the place.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope that now we can move forward, leave last season behind us and achieve success."
Women can’t sleep at night because of this fear associated with retirement savings
Although the study participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study said they had spoken to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don’t take the steps to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
This is where you have to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t share your wishes with them early.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how you can get care because such choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your choices for long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid life insurance policy in cash value, which can help you cover expenses or provide self-insurance with your own funds, if you have any.
Get your legal documents in order: Avoid legal battles right from the start.
Take out a health care authorization so that you can authorize a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that health professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, think about your financial resources.
In this way, you would choose a person of trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and to pay your bills if you are not able to do it yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about the medications he drinks and his allergies?
Please note these details in writing so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just about finances, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin asks.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make a plan like this.”
Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle as he was returning home from an exit.
The victim, aged about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place at around 2:30 BST (British daylight saving time) as an "accidental act".
The victim did not see his assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police are appealing to witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to the disruption of communications, aid workers are unable to obtain information from the Dongala district, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Below are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a district that extends over 300 kilometres (180 mi) of coastline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The district, which is an administrative region within the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency says Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
A tsunami also hit western Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: A major earthquake off the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them Aceh residents.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake strikes an area near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami that reached 10 meters and destroyed dozens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow-focus earthquake struck Pidi Jaya district in Aceh, causing havoc and panic as it reminded people of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time the earthquake did not cause a tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Trek Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering in a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by police officers in Alaska.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in the Mat-Su detention facility with the possibility of leaving if he pays a sum of $500, KTUU reported.
On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he said he was "definitely innocent" when asked how he was pleading before the court, the network said.
Palin faces three Class A offenses, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case before the Alaska Veterans Court is pending.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, meddling in a domestic violence crime report, and possession of a weapon under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he allegedly punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she said her son’s violent behavior stemmed from PTSD, a consequence of his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake hit an area near Central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
On social media, videos are circulated showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for the beach festival in Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for New York terror suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck in October to attack a bike path on the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan and run over pedestrians and cyclists who found themselves in his path.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty delivered to the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, it is possible to impose the death penalty on both of these grounds from the indictment.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of manslaughter for racketeering purposes, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "detailed planning and deliberation," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "horrific, cruel and perverse."
"Sajfulo Habibulajevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov caused, injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, En-Laure Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erly, Hernan Ferucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnu<0xC4><0x8D>o's The State of Pagnu<0xC4><0x8D>o."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since a death penalty case was prosecuted in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was carried out in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being convicted of conspiracy to carry out espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were sentenced to death by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months that followed the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
Police also said he had asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of accepting a guilty plea and imposing a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Lawmaker from the Tory party says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage, during a protest at a Tory party conference, vowed to "mobilize the people's army."
The former leader of the Ukip party said politicians must "feel the heat" from eurosceptics, with one of Theresa May's lawmakers proposing he be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative supporter Peter Bonn told a march in Birmingham that the UK would have been "out of the EU" by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in terms of uniting her deeply divided members was highlighted by counter-Brexit members of the Tory party who joined a special anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is trying to move forward with the Chequers plan despite attacks from pro-Brexit, counter-Brexit and the EU.
The allies insisted that she would continue trying to reach a deal with Brussels despite strong reactions and that she would force Eurosceptics and Labour members to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr. Bon told the pro-Brexit Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to "reject the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge of the negotiations, we would have been out of the EU by now," he said.
The Welshborough MP added: "I will support Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers plan."
Expressing his stance against the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars for now to be subjugated.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bon dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is completely incorrect.”
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Tory and pro-Brexit parties, also attended the march and told reporters: “I’m just saying: PM, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not well-received by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not well-received by our party and our activists who are actually the ones who take to the streets and to whom our election victory is due.
Please give up the Chequers plan and start listening to us."
In a message to Mrs May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the gathering that politicians must "feel the heat" if they intend to hand over the decision that was taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to tell them that ‘we will not let you get away with that.’
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has given us the victory in Brexit and that will not stop until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, counter-Brexit figures marched through Birmingham, before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Following the group's gathering, a small number of activists showed up this weekend carrying banners reading "Tories against Brexit".
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, mocked conservatives for the security issues they faced at the opening of the conference over the party-created app.
“These are people who tell us that they can set up IT systems and all the necessary technology for Canada plus, for a border without controls, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to think carefully about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "think carefully about running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a representative of the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke about her future during a town hall in western Massachusetts this Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run in the November re-election against Republican State Representative Jeff Dill, who co-chaired the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters since Trump took office, which uses the format of a town hall.
One of the attendees asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that “it’s time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes putting a woman on top.”
The suspect in the shooting and death of basketball player Simms from the team "LSU" was arrested
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday that the suspect in the shooting and death of basketball player Wade Simms of the LSU team, which occurred on Friday, has been arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Ditheon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man from the footage.
Simms, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wade Simms had a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade intervened to defend his friends and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present at the scene, owning a gun, and shooting Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
As a junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Simms played in 32 games with 10 appearances last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 goals per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closer to world title after team orders secure victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified on Saturday before Lewis Hamilton it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team will play a big role in the race.
From pole position Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton at a loss while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel came first in boxing and left Hamilton to fight the turmoil at the end of the group, something that was supposed to play a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the pits one lap later and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after a one-on-one action that forced Ferrari's driver to reluctantly leave the interior at his own free risk of staying on the sidelines after a double move to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and finished seventh on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round.
He then led most of the race and steered his car’s tyres to quickly reach the finish line and overtake Kimi Raikkonen, taking fourth place.
He eventually entered boxing in the 44th round, but could not increase the pace in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen came in fourth.
“Today is a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and he was a true gentleman who let me pass.
The team made a really exceptional decision to have their own couple in the race," Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diana Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she had not published a letter from Christine Blassie Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In his speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "malicious and rude and dishonest."
“There’s only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what’s been happening in the last few days in the Senate you can see anger, people who are angry and mean and ruthless and dishonest,” he said.
“When you see posts and leaks and they say, ‘Oh, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you publish this information?
Do you remember her answer... did you publish the document – “oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't publish it."
Wait a minute, then.
Whether we published it... No, we did not publish it," he added, imitating the senator.
A letter was sent to Feinstein with information about the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and they were published in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leaks came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t publish her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to keep them confidential and I did what she asked."
But the president doesn’t seem to believe her denial, so he commented on the same at a rally on Saturday: “I’ll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t do it, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the allegations to achieve their own goals.
“They are determined to regain power in any way they can.
You can see their malice, their meanness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample to regain power and control," the president said.
Elite League: "Dundee Stars" 5-3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in a match against Dundee.
Dundee Stars made up for losing their Elite League game against Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the 5-3 rematch at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were given a two-goal advantage by Patrick Dwyer and Frances Beauvilliers.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney scored an advantage for the host before Dwyer returned the lead to the Giants.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their win with his two goals.
This was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for the Adam Keefe boys, who returned with a 2-1 win over Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides of the season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
The chance for Dwyer came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 a.m. with the addition of Kendall McFaul, which was secured by David Rutherford while Beauvilliers doubled the lead four minutes later.
This was a quick opening of the match, Sullivan secured the host's lead by 13:10, before Matt Mercart assisted Kauni to score 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead until the first break, when he scored the second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The host regrouped and Bushard brought them back with a powerful game and goal, with the result being 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen first secure Dundee's lead in the game late in the second period and he secured his team's win in half of the final period of the fifth game.
The Giants, who lost four of their last five games, will play their next game on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
Air traffic controller killed, helping hundreds of people on plane to escape earthquake
A flight controller in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero after he died helping a plane carrying hundreds of people safely take off.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to ravage the area, with many stranded in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues escaping to save their own lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the control tower at the airport of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri in Palu, which was constantly swaying.
He remained in his position to ensure that the Batik Air aircraft with flight number 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower the moment he thought the tower was going to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision likely saved hundreds of lives, ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"This news has broken our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the Disaster Mitigation Agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sighi and Butong is limited.
"The death toll is believed to be increasing as many bodies are still under the rubble, while many cannot be accessed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching up to six meters have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Emergency ambulances carry bodies every minute.
There is not enough clean water.
The mini-markets are being robbed everywhere."
Ian Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get worse.”
Indonesian President Yoko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
“Are you ready?” asked CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini plane crash in Micronesia says one person has disappeared after plane crash in lagoon
The airline, which operated the plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, said one person was missing after it said 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said it could not find the male passenger as of Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuck Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the exact order of events, remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane crashed into a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low.
"It's an extremely good job," Janes said.
Janes said he and the others managed to cross the water up to half way and head for the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and shouting, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working near the reconstruction of the port also helped rescue people by using an inflatable boat to carry them to shore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Aviation safety data shows that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyst sets time frame for night when woman set on fire alive
Prosecutors finished presenting the case on Saturday for the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He noted that the jury used phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, contrary to his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was interrogated on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth by saying he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said he was “lying because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages and calls, as well as her contact information, from his phone.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defense is expected to present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to decide the case later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscience Hip-Hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to refute the negative attitude about this genre by including positive messages in their music.
Bristol's The High Breed argue that hip-hop has drifted away from its origins as political-message music aimed at solving social problems.
They want to go back to his roots and re-populate conscious hip-hop.
Artists such as "The Fugees" and "Common" have recently experienced their revival through artists such as "Akala" and "Lowkey".
Another black woman?
New York City Nurse Sues Couple After She Was Fired After Sending Racist Message
A New York City nanny is suing a married couple for being fired on grounds of discrimination after she mistakenly received a message from her mother complaining about the fact that she was "another black woman."
The couple denied being racist, saying the lawsuit was "extortion."
Lincy Plasco-Flaxmann, a mother of two, was disappointed when, in 2016, after the first day of work of the new caregiver Giselle Morris, she found out that she was black.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, and twice.
After realizing what Plasco-Flaxman had actually done, she felt "uncomfortable" and fired Ms. Morris, saying that their sociable African-American nanny had done her job badly and that she expected the nanny to be from the Philippines instead.
Ms. Morris was paid for her first day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Morris is now suing the couple and seeking compensation for the $350-a-day layoff over a six-month period, an engagement that will involve her living with her family, something she was originally hired to do, but without a contract.
"I want to show them that you shouldn't do these things," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the claims that they were racist, saying that the dismissal of Mrs. Morris was a reasonable procedure because they feared that they could no longer trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
But would you trust your children to a person you were rude to, even by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's be real."
Calling the lawsuit “extortion,” Plasco said his wife gave birth to the baby just two months ago and was in “a very difficult situation.”
“You’re going to attack someone who’s in that situation?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public immediately condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers fear readers won’t be able to connect with a talking bear, new letter reveals
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's really hard to put yourself in the place of someone reading the book for the first time before it's published.
It’s very interesting that we now know all this about Paddington’s tremendous success.
After saying her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the book from a small bear-shaped toy, would still be optimistic if his work wasn’t well received, she added that the book’s 60th anniversary was “both bitter and sweet” after his death last year.
For Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she adds that her father felt a quiet pride in his potential success.
"He was a really quiet man and didn't want to brag at all," she said.
But because he felt Paddington was so real, it was almost like having a child who had achieved something in life: and you’re proud of him, even though success isn’t due to you.
“I think Paddington’s success was perceived that way.
Although it was a creation and a figment of his imagination, he always credited Paddington himself."
My daughter was on her deathbed and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
On landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called me regularly to tell me that the situation is very bad and that he is not expected to survive,” Ms. Ednan-Laperuz said.
“Then Nad called to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did to her.
And I said, "Tashi, I really love you, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the drugs given to her by the doctors to keep her heart pumping was slowly diminishing and they were coming out of her system.
She died early, and that meant all her systems were failing.
I just had to sit and wait, aware of the fact that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family members and people.
I really had to stay calm.”
In the end, Mrs. Eden-Laperouse, grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
I bowed my head and the tears didn’t stop.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt immense compassion for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her."
Women put cards on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide make an effort to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers where people can call for support.
Ms. Davis’ son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, said her son had great potential to become a chef, as well as an infectious smile.
Everyone remembers him by his smile.
People have always said that his smile can light up any room.”
However, he gave up his job before he died because it was "in a really dark place."
His 11-year-old brother was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after taking his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly afraid that it will have a consequential effect."
Mrs. Davis makes the cards "to let others know that there are people out there they can reach and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don’t sit in silence, you have to start talking.”
Ms. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Ms. Davis's, lost her partner Mark, whom she married 15 years after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was unhappy or depressed, or he didn't say anything," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas Day when the children opened their presents, and he didn’t look them in the eye at all and didn’t make any contact with them.”
She said his death was a huge trauma for all of them, but they must find a way to get through it: “Such a thing destroys the family.
It leaves us broken.
But we have to keep going and keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh’s future is uncertain after the FBI opened an investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually get something that looked like what he was asking for, that is, a limited-time, limited-range investigation, maybe we could achieve a little unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he fears the committee is "falling apart" in the face of an ingrained partisan stalemate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their hesitation is due solely to the timing.
The midterm elections are due to take place in just a few weeks, on Nov. 6, and if Republicans are expected to face failure, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man to the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush calls the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who in turn worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can win at least 50 votes in the Senate vote, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to change the tie-breaking result and enter the Supreme Court.
North Korea's refugee population 'decreased' under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Beyong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 border crossings last year compared to 2011, when there were 2,706.
Park said tougher border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs on human traffickers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
Most of the refugees from North Korea eventually acquire citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 people from North Korea have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and which can be crossed more easily than the well-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people illegal migrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss topics that focused on stalling denuclearization talks.
This followed a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work toward the goal of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday blamed U.S.-imposed sanctions for stagnating progress since then.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and in such conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm first," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
The House minority leader called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that given his temperament, he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman acted that way, they would say she was 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blassie Ford when they were teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional at his opening remarks, sometimes even shouting and sobbing as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him “a grotesque and coordinated destruction of his reputation” orchestrated by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony was evidence that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because he had been shown to be biased against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi did not respond to a question about whether she would try to remove Cavano from office if the allegations against him were confirmed and if Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this: if he's not telling the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he's not only not fit to serve in the Supreme Court, he's not fit to serve in the court where he's currently in office," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible rulings by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because he was seen as subject to conservative justice.
In hearings to confirm his candidacy, Cavano did not answer questions about whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court rulings.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased man to go to court and expect us to say, 'that's really wonderful, isn't it,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to use it too.
It's a really harsh criticism, months and years of amassing anger that she can't get rid of without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do you?”
She continued, “I was helped a lot by a woman who was in an executive position somewhere, who told me that she also cries when she’s angry, but she managed to develop her own technique, so when she gets angry and starts crying, she tells the person she’s talking to, “You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continues to cry.
I think that’s genius.”
Tears are allowed as a vent for anger partly because they are essentially misinterpreted.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office was when I once began to cry with inexpressible anger and an elderly woman, a cold manager from whom I had always had a certain fear, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me to the stairs.
“Don’t ever let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll enjoy the fact that they’ve been able to touch you.”
Patricia Schroeder was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado at the time and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a ship called the Monkey Business and withdrew from the presidential race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she should not consider running for president.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," he told me 30 years later through laughter.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Given the fact that the campaign was launched a long time ago, she did not have enough financial resources, so she promised that she would not enter the race if she did not collect $ 2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000 each, would only give her $250.
“Do they think there should be a discount for me?” she asked.
During a speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions, that is, gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters, not delegates and anger at sexism, she began to cry.
“If you saw me, you’d probably think I was having a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalls of how the media reacted to the incident.
“You would have thought that Klinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my tombstone.
"She's crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be a good thing for Beijing
The opening of fire with the start of the U.S.-China trade war has been muted, and while the battle is far from over, the conflict between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by taxing key exports to China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation escalated significantly this week with the introduction of new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of the goods coming into the United States from China.
Beijing has repeatedly backed down, imposing tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has promised to return the United States to the same extent, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will give up on the same in the near future.
Getting Washington to back down means accepting its demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well, the pressures of a trade war with the United States could result in positive support for China in the long run as it would reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for the start of a sharp decline from an economic point of view in any of the countries is much more dangerous than was previously determined by observers," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for a New American Security, which
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help rebuild a country ravaged by a long war that has lasted more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas ravaged by terrorists in order to bring the situation back to normal.
All conditions have now been secured for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilaterally imposed economic measures that have affected their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime welcomed help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team defeated the United States team in the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six European titles in a row and has not won a Ryder Cup title in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its primacy after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mikkelson, who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, hit the ball in the water in par-3 on the 16th hole on his first shot from a hole, losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari rose to prominence in all rounds, becoming one of four players to score 5–0–0 since the tournament began in the current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spite lost 5-4 to the lowest ranked player of the European team, Torbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olessen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's top-ranked player, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have last played in the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, a participant in eight Ryder Cups, became the European who won the most titles in the tournament with 25.5 points during his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stop today.
This year has been really hard.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
“I’m very happy to have the title back.
Team play is the most important thing and I am happy that I was able to help," the emotional Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a said after winning Europe.
He is now ceding his place to fellow countryman John Ram, who on Sunday defeated Tiger Woods, the American golf legend, 2-1.
“I feel incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play,” Ram said.
Woods lost in all four matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
This is an incredible statistic of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, ranking after Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team spent the weekend trying to steer the game to low-grass pitches, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
Team USA captain Jim Furik said after his team's disappointing game, "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
At one point this morning, we gave the European team a hard time.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the Professional Golfers' Association of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going to move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to confess to them.
We've been outplayed.
