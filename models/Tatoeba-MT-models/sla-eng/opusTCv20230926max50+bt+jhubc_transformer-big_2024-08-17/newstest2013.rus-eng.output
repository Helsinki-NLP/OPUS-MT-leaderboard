Republican strategy to resist Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, arguing that election fraud cases in the United States are more rare than deaths from lightning strikes.
In addition, the lawyers of the Republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is for sure: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing U.S. federal elections.
That is why most state governments have enacted laws since 2009 that make it difficult to register or vote.
This phenomenon gained new momentum after the November 2010 election, which brought the Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were passed in 2011 alone, restricting voting rights in 41 states.
The new election laws require voters to show a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws shorten the period of early voting, abolish the right to register a voter on the day of expression of will and take away the right to vote from citizens with a criminal record.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of a law passed in Indiana.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated bills requiring voters to show photo IDs in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have such a universal identity card as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, that is, 21 million people who have reached the age required to vote, do not have an ID card with a photo issued by their state’s government authority.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds one hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 percent of African Americans, 15 percent of people earning less than $35,000, 18 percent of citizens over the age of 65, and 20 percent of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
But that's not all.
Students who vote for Democratic candidates are not allowed to use a photo ID issued by their school in several states.
But these same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, which vote mostly for Republicans, to use for voting the certificates issued by these clubs.
Until 2004, no state required proof of U.S. citizenship for voting.
This was the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at restricting the voting of Latin American citizens.
It is estimated that two-thirds of Hispanic voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated legislation in 2011 to abolish voter registration on election day in eight states.
They have also restricted the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register.
This restriction has not gone without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to add about 10 million citizens to the lists.
At the same time, measures taken since 2009 have resulted in a 17 per cent drop in the level of new voter registration in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other states have passed laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted early were African-American, although the latter accounted for only 13% of the total number of voters in the state.
The same thing happened with Latin Americans.
Representing only 11% of voters, they constituted 24% of citizens who voted early.
Unlike whites, who formed 76% of voters, among early voters were only 46%.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters are actively opposed to the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills were vetoed by Democratic governors.
The most controversial laws were suspended with the intervention of the United States Attorney General.
This allowed to partially limit the negative consequences.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring photo ID.
However, the new rules that have come into force will certainly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Critics of the Democrats condemn the bias of the laws that were passed, seeing them as clearly aimed at influencing the results of the 2012 election in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral College to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with confidence that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Prostate Cancer Screening: To Pass the Test or Not?
In fact, a PSA test produces sometimes false-negative and sometimes false-positive results that lead to useless medical intervention.
For men who are reluctant to undergo a medical examination, there is something to doubt even more.
To take the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, there were numerous cases of infection among the study groups, so the findings are difficult to interpret and it is difficult to make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found different mortality rates in those patients who underwent screening and those who did not.
This study also showed, after a 12-year follow-up, that metastases are 30-40% more likely to occur in those who have not been screened.
Therefore, I would recommend taking the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at increased risk.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as the cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and sluggish.
The patient needs to explain the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him possible options, without the mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a danger to life in the long term, and making a choice, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance of the disease.
To date, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer will not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to life.
We will offer them active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we will begin treatment.
Increasingly, we define the criteria for deciding who should or should not receive treatment.
Therefore, I would recommend taking the test.
But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not you need to take this test.
In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Movember created a tool to assess the pros and cons of taking a PSA test.

Prevent the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, following a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of the disease.
It is believed that if all people ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
“If no one else smoked, that number would have risen to at least 50 percent,” said Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cancer cases are caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite a decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous harm to human health.
“Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Quebec government.
After 10 years of quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
Weight
According to CAR data, overweight and obesity also contribute to the appearance of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Studies show that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the association added.
Meals
The association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities, it increases the risk of colon cancer.
Sausage products should also be avoided.
Preserving meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can harm the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," the Association explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have been studying the effect of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.
But at the moment, the results of these studies can not be called unambiguous.
According to the SCC, studies of vitamin E give conflicting results.
If one of them showed a decrease in the risk of developing prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.
The impact of vitamin D on cancer development is also unclear.
However, Mr. Bollier stresses that it is important to discuss your concerns and family history with your doctor.
"Analysis does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
Last summer, reports that scientists may have discovered the Higgs boson caused a stir — and not without reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all particles in the universe, neither much nor little.
Furthermore, it is the last particle whose existence was predicted by the Standard Model—our best, or at least “least imperfect,” description of the nature and behavior of matter—but which was previously undetectable by experiment.
But physicists are still not entirely sure that it is the Higgs boson.
We know, without a shadow of a doubt, that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it strongly resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, although for full confidence some data is not yet enough.
Imagine, however, that we are talking about the Higgs boson, since the chances of making a mistake seem minimal, and we will see what this means.
There is, in this world, one law which is absolutely inevitable, which says that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way around this rule, do not even try too hard, otherwise you will harm yourself.
But although the physics of elementary particles is a rather strange world, it turns out that it also has one law of a similar nature: the Pauli exclusion principle, which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" lies, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
Therefore, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find decent citizens, called fermions, who prudently obey the Pauli principle.
In the other, bosons, an abominable gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything — at least this principle, which means that they can calmly be in the same place at the same time.
According to the Berkeley Laboratory's (by the way, quite extraordinary) Particle Adventure website, these bosons are, in turn, divided into two groups: the mesons, which we will not talk about here, and the "force particles", through which the main forces of nature spread and to which the Higgs boson in some way refers.
These very bosons, it should be emphasized, are not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly banal boson: the photon, or “particle of light”, which is the “courier” of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one particle that has an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "violates" the electromagnetic field at that particular location, roughly like a stone thrown into a pond.
From this "violation" an electromagnetic wave is born (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the bosons of the "force carriers".
A more stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the only difference that in order for this boson to appear, another field, the Higgs field, must be “broken”.
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to achieve very, very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond, the surface of which could shake only a very large stone.
That’s why a huge particle accelerator like the one operated at CERN – the Large Hadron Collider, which is a ring 27 km in diameter! – is needed to achieve such enormous energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, will never keep itself on the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (like a photon, by the way) do not.
So, what can all these studies “bring” to you, asks Ms. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to test the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to sense the discrepancy between the results of observations and the predictions of the SM.
In addition, some of them are eager for such a discrepancy to be discovered, because the slightest discrepancy can open the door to "new physics" and shut some holes in the Model.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant drawbacks, offering no explanation for gravity (oh!) or for dark matter, which forms roughly 80% of the universe (oh-oh!).
But so far, no such differences have been found in CERN.
Implications
The benefits of these studies for the everyday life of the average person are more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it does not exist.
In the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser research in Bell’s labs could not have imagined what a revolution their work would bring.
They anticipated their applications in science, but nothing more.
Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the previous ones were pulsed) in 1962, said that initially the laser was seen more as a “laboratory gadget.”
Imagine...
And in addition, the application can be found for the tools that accompany the study.
For example, the same Willyard Boyle during his optical research in 1969 developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, while not at all its original purpose, now serves as the “eye” for all digital cameras in the world and earned the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Large Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative care is the best way to die... <0xE4><0xB8><0xAD><0xE6><0x96><0x87> "Debt"
The Commission for a Decent Death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is due to resume soon, and at this time a bill is being prepared.
Nevertheless, much remains to be done in this crucial area.
"Debt" tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montereggio.
Prostate cancer, which destroyed him from the inside, gave him a delay of two years.
“I was given five years, I lived seven,” he says, between life and death, lying in bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloy, where he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, it’s impossible to prepare for it,” he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the toilet on your own and even eating on your own.
Sitting at a table with an appetizing lunch, he gives up and agrees to be helped to eat.
He invigorates, even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicine, take him to the bath.
Courage before ordinary death.
“My greatest desire to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating,” he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for the disease.
“We are taught throughout life that a man should urinate standing up,” says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois shelter.
Regressing to the state of a child is an unbearable humiliation for some.
“It all depends on a person’s ability” to come to terms with decline, he argues.
Since, according to many people engaged in palliative care, important events occur in the midst of this decline.
Patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palliative home are all cancer patients.
Forecasts give them a maximum of three months to live.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses no longer provides assistance called “medical.”
Mrs. A., 89, is most afraid to die “consciously from suffocation.”
But the disease allowed me to get to know my children.
“I have good kids,” she adds.
“I don’t want anything else in life,” she says, before allowing her to put on a breathing mask.
She is still waiting for the last visit of her son, who came from Italy, in the coming days.
In the shelter Victor-Gadbois with the help of a group of volunteers provide body care and assistance with nutrition.
This is the palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, for every 11,700 inhabitants, there is one place in palliative care facilities.
It's a very small thing, given that sooner or later we're all going to die.
Here, life continues in the best conditions possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors of the shelter.
Whether it is physical, emotional or emotional comfort.
To the dying, we will agree to provide oral rinsing of brandy or Pepsi, depending on what he asks.
Diabetics are no longer forced to control their sugar levels.
Death is a part of everyday life.
Last night we brought a beer to Mr. H., who died tonight.
In the morning, his son finished this beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We are helping loved ones as well as patients,” says Natalie Savar, director of patient care.
In the shelter of Victor-Gadbois, no day is like the previous one.
Next to a 93-year-old man who is enjoying his last meeting with his family in the yard, lying on his pillows during a toast in his honor, a 36-year-old man tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children and trying everything to survive.
“In the last six months, three to five beds have always been occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois shelter come from home, and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is estimated that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care that is provided to alleviate the suffering of patients who have entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in a shelter.
And some institutions, such as the Victor-Gadbois Shelter and the Society for Palliative Care at Home in Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is this large gap in Quebec’s health care system that causes many palliative care professionals to fear the passage of a law legalizing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by palliative care luminaries Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe has been circulating, attesting to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec’s health care system is not effective enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
“Recently,” she says, “I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room, in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to relieve them.
I'm afraid that patients only want to die because they don't receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists until the last day are trying to save patients, despite pessimistic forecasts.
Hopes of survival for Ellen Richard were already minimal when she stopped debilitating chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me she regretted that I was stopping the fight.
She told me that my days were numbered.
There is no omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask for death thank the medical staff for not fulfilling their request after the palliative care team relieves their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Home Palliative Care Society of Greater Montreal, patients are not susceptible to pain relief in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until the moment of his death, either from time to time or permanently.
We can no longer pretend that we are not aware of these sufferings.
More and more often, patients who fail to relieve pain will be able to have access to palliative sedation.
Patients suffering from pain always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But it doesn’t necessarily mean “I want to be euthanized,” it means “I want to feel better.”
The creation of this report was made possible thanks to a journalistic grant from the Institute of Health Research of Canada.
Large-Scale Real Estate Scandals in Quebec
Road construction officials, construction contractors, political party fundraisers, and Italian mafia experts tell us day after day what they know about the colossal “system” that is entangling the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists, and mobsters.
"Industry", which was very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in 1990 and 2000.
“It’s curious how this system falls apart after all the money has been put into it,” joked Jacques Duchenne, a lawmaker and former Montreal police chief.
It was thanks to him that a scandal broke out in 2011 as a by-product of the investigation of official crimes related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the Prime Minister of that time from the liberals, Jean Charet, agreed very reluctantly.
The Duchenne Report established a direct link between industry, secret funding of political parties, and corruption.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, the Department of Transportation alone would have kept a billion dollars in contracts” if some held back their instincts to take a cut.
Charbonneau’s commission “has already displaced two mayors,” he adds, hoping it will be able to “open up the schemes behind individual personalities.”
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, which was established in 2011, included a large staff of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, the staff of the special unit “Molot”, which after 2009 forced the “merchandise cartel” of Montreal, to stop overestimating the value of contracts.
In recent weeks, a series of searches have been carried out, and some municipal officials, in particular Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of the small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
The next is Gilles Vaillantcourt, who recently resigned as mayor of Laval, the third-largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving bribes when placing government orders.
In addition, a number of Montreal Railway Service engineers and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have been formally indicted.
The latter blew up a real bomb, telling the investigation about the "system" of obtaining state contracts.
For several years, Zambito gave 3% of the value of the contracts concluded in Montreal to some intermediary associated with the mafia, who, in turn, transferred money to the party of Mayor Gerald Trumble “United Montreal”.
In the 2000s, Zambito poured money to the right and left. He transferred more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various parties in the province, mostly liberals in power at the time.
He also admitted to illegally raising funds for former Liberal Party deputy prime minister Natalie Normando.
Sewerage contracts in which the value was overstated
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked flawlessly.
Gilles Surprenant, a former civil engineer, described it in detail before the commission: in ten years, he received gifts from construction firms, invitations to travel, to golf tournaments, to restaurants, to hockey matches and bribes in total of $ 736,000 in exchange for sewer contracts, the cost of which he inflated.
Other officials in charge of road construction admitted to getting their hands on it by inflating the bills by 30-40% with fake additions.
Then one organiser from the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Trumble of deliberately turning a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party’s coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Trumble resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Roulot was one of the first deputies in Montreal to sound the alarm.
The mayor of the riviera de prairie district in the east of the island, she has resisted since 2010 the sale of a municipal plot bought for $5 million and resold for... 1.6 million developers in the midst of a construction boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She says that in the investigation that will eventually be launched, she will “pull the string to understand the functioning of the system infested with ants to stop gangrene and identify the culprits.”
She described the process as “painful but positive.”
We are in the process of clearing the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigation team and observer to avoid a return to questionable practices.
How we clean the house.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchenne notes for his part that “officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars,” but he is particularly concerned about the role of “elective officials who knew about the scheme” but were not involved in the machinations.
Given that the share of dirty money in campaign finance in Quebec reaches 70%, he jokes: “I was told that it was just a pale reflection of reality.”
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties to $100, but it will not change the situation, he said: “Until we strictly limit election spending, there will be dirty money in politics.”
He demands a complete overhaul of the system of granting state contracts and financing parties: "We can not go below; boldly understanding the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and legality."
If this story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchenne urges those who laugh to look into their own backyard.
PSG is not FC Barcelona.
This season at PSG you have achieved an extraordinary scale.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual consciousness, but it can also be explained by a new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I grow with them every day.
The technical staff also contributed a lot.
These factors make me raise the level of my game every day.
During the game, it’s easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I'm not burning up.
From the very beginning in the pre-training centre at the NIF in Clerfontaine until my arrival in Saint-<0xC3><0x89>tienne, I always took a step forward.
Thus, you benefit from the competition established by Carlo Ancelotti...
The addition of this summer is not a novelty to play matches of a very high level.
They also know that every workout is very important.
This leads to the fact that a player like me is eager to be on the level and to give his best.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti provides support in my positioning.
He is assisted by substitutes like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the master of the situation?
Oh, sure.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technical staff.
Today in the First League he has no equal and he is among the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience and has won many titles with top clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had a very encouraging conversation with him.
Then I walked away from a series of injuries.
The trust he places in me also explains my accomplishments.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In the Premier League, Lyon took our place as a leader.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have effectively qualified for the eighth final.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, anything can be.
We will be able to say our word face-to-face with very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, before Porto, to be able to take the return match in one eighth final.
Can PSG become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for that.
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and consolidate its position for the long term.
It's not like that today.
Financially, PSG has the means to make this project a reality.
Not taking the Premier League title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year we really want to win this championship.
We were close to that last season.
In May, there was disappointment because we had everything to get to the finish line first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points implies the title of champion.
But another team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think everything will be fine.
Despite the fact that such strong teams as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux have entered the fight for the title, I think we have the strength to win.
Don’t you think the media expects too much from PSG?
It’s normal to expect a lot from us, given how much has been invested and what kind of players we have.
We are fully prepared for this.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 against Troy at home and we still find something to criticize, of course, it's a little frustrating.
We wonder what people expect from us in the first place.
We will never be able to win every weekend with a 4-0 score.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to implement a game project.
The team is formed over time.
We have proven in the Champions League that we can meet today’s challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who have not managed to make it to the eighth final for two seasons, although they have also spent a lot of money!
Given the amount invested, we represented you 15 points ahead of the winter break.
It would be disrespectful to our opponents and to the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not at the top last season, were “awakened” by this new PSG.
It shows how exciting the Premier League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, as a result we won.
PSG seems to depend entirely on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s exploits.
So what if they say that there is some kind of "golden dependence".
This only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He came for this and he proves that he is the star of the First League.
Everywhere he’s played, he’s shown he’s a great player and a world-class star.
We respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did was truly exceptional.
This encourages others to improve their game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro 2012 with the French national team?
It's a disappointment.
I really wanted to participate in the Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from taking up some of my playing time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I came out stronger.
Today I am able to play good qualifiers.
That's what I've been hoping for since I was baptized by the Blues.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine and now we must behave in an exemplary manner.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
They are effective for him.
He has a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
He is a strict coach, he is close to the players and inspires to win.
How was Laurent Blanc?
But I don't want to compare.
“Blanc has achieved his goal, he has qualified us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps brings the Blues to Brazil.
A well-deserved draw (1-1), snatched on October 16 in Spain is a fundamental match?
This game gave me confidence in myself.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, there were no such matches in my career.
Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The exact opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, numbered transactions between receiving parties with commission fees for their processing.
In addition, as is often the case with these technologies, the political vision is clear: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros ...) and a secure exchange protocol of the type BitTorrent, which allows you to exchange files between participants of the same level.
About 200,000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousand sites accept bitcoins for donations or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin exchange rate, peaking at $30 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later before returning today to about $10 (rates are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
There is nothing special in comparison with the world exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on virtual currency, published in October, was interested in this system.
He describes Bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency,” “competing with the dollar or the euro,” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, like the “credits” used to promote a video game that are earned during the game or that can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But exchange operations are always controlled and handled by a central authority.
In Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are simultaneously ledger holders, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses, like an e-mail.
Only for each new payment, the user can choose a different address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically, using a double-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that the bitcoins used in the transaction actually exist in a public ledger distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this book.
It goes through the solution of a mathematical problem sent to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, gets the privilege to add this new line.
We are talking about the hashing phase of the file, that is, the conversion of a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "take" a new transaction and add a number to it before "hashing" all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes easily check that it is correct.
The transaction thus turns out to be inextricably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for the purpose of cheating, the user very quickly (in less than ten minutes) would want to pay twice with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed, since they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the problem receives 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the prize is regularly split in half, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible by one hundred million, which leaves another reserve.
The complexity of the task also increases with the increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already experienced ups and downs.
Sites that provide Bitcoin services have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen from reserves.
“The defect used does not concern the protocol itself,” assures Pierre Noiza, who recently launched Paymium, a company that makes real money payments using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this disadvantage.
Major players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, allow them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and found that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
The “giant sales” were announced in November.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” rejoices Jon Holmqvist, who works at Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Nouza, another author of the manual on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
Its system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or contactless payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to verify transactions, which is thus cheaper.
The owner has better control over their personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It is enough to provide an address that can be “photographed and recognized” by the phone, Pierre Noisy said, assuring that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to revise hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal ones.
“It will take some time before Bitcoin is established, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
The ECB’s report suggests, by the way, that the various risks considered elevated today should the system succeed.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapis and Surobi).
NATO and the U.S. are expected to follow suit in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future without relying solely on us.
We suffered mainly from Afghan peasants, whom we regarded as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 soldiers killed, both wounded and maimed.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often of peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case under the Soviet Union.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are tolerated, they are sometimes helped by local rebels, but they will no longer be as soon as the West behaves more delicately.
The withdrawal of French troops from Nijrab, which I observed from the height of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French loans, was in order.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles escorted by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
There will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul by the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their insurmountable advance from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the struggle between the various factions.
Taking control of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women paid for the obscurantism of these peasants, in which they were surpassed by al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved in our days.
The former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have turned into dealers taking over state land to resell for development to returnees from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of huge US subcontracts.
They are discredited; most of them, by the way, did not even fight themselves.
The people, as I have heard in the countryside, want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have managed American generosity: the outflow of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its benefits.
About 65 per cent of the population is under the age of 25; there are now 5 million inhabitants in Kabul, one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in cities are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people who will not want to return either to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militants, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world and that are watched everywhere.
We currently have an army.
Will the authorities that will command it be considered legitimate?
The old commanders, leading the anti-Soviet struggle, are already taking measures to restore the provincial squads, which would not obey the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, should be to some extent decentralized, following the example of Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, removing the post of prime minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially ahead of the April 2014 elections.
But his country, since the 1950s and even earlier, has been dependent on foreign aid.
The industry has not been put on its feet, no dam is functioning, no irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country destroyed by thirty years of war, state control over infrastructure would be necessary.
There were rumors that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
This only heightened the feeling that Western countries were there only to take possession of them.
Without the energy to process iron ore or copper on site, without the means of transportation to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak copper field, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and remain the province’s largest employers.
It is also necessary that, one day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports depend to a large extent, return to normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat units ended on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: a lyceum for girls, for boys, the Faculty of French at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural spheres, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to "conquer hearts and minds" and to accomplish the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the service of "military-civilian activity" under the Ministry of Defense (Cemic), abolished in 2012, together with a small French public organization, contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at the restoration of agriculture in the ten mountains.
These works, with the intensive involvement of the local labor force, were able to help contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, restoration of forests, fruit trees, soil protection and an increase in the area of arable land.
What will we leave in our memory after spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would help to improve the living conditions of the local population, very harsh in these valleys, often located at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural work coming from local communities in the province of Capisa.
In order to get rid of the uprisings led by foreign groups, which the farmers have told me they want, they need a little non-military support that is well-controlled and direct to them.
The Difficult Births of the Egyptian Constitution
This is a risky new move by President Mohamed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever, on the issue of a constitutional declaration that temporarily gives it emergency powers, he has decided to play wa-bank.
Taking everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the next day.
Exactly a week ago, the head of state gave the Assembly two additional months to complete the work.
It is almost two years since Egypt has relied on a preliminary text that has been amended several times, weakening institutional stability and leading to legal contradictions.
This new initiative only strengthened the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his “autocratic nonsense”, continuing to “violate the word” and “violate the law”.
The camp of his followers believe that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis, speeding up the transition process.
The referendum must be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time, which causes the Brothers to abandon the intention to explain to the Egyptians the text, article by article.
For the president, it is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages across the country.
Mohamed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Moreover, the call for accelerated voting is like an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: “Either you vote for my text, or I reserve myself extraordinary powers,” which are supposed to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.
Most liberals did not respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to convey their opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
To achieve the required quorum, 11 reserve participants were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that in most cases the articles were voted unanimously.
Commentators, by the way, amused by the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day arose around... time for prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the clock of the Constituent Assembly was set incorrectly.
The text, which was voted on yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
The object of general attention, Article 2 eventually remained identical to the Article of the 1971 Constitution, which states that “the principles of the Shari’ah are the main source of law”.
Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the main requirements, hoped to replace “principles” with “rules”, which would make it possible to apply them more strictly.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," replied the liberals, who saw it only as PR.
Because, in their opinion, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to verifying the conformity of Shariah laws.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pomier, this is alarming because “people called to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.”
We can observe the birth of theocracy.”
Many liberals are also agitated by the fact that the next rector of this university seems to be far less moderate than the current one.
“There is currently no specific religious intervention.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulemas, but people with university education, some were trained in the French system,” said Alexis Bloe, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that “ambiguities may arise around Article 220, since the terms used in it are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, - ed.].
And in the future, the question may arise as to whether civil judges are competent to make decisions about this.”
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is criticized because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers claim that they have significantly decreased compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another controversial point: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defense budget will be held not in the Parliament, but in the National Defense Council.
Also, the trial of civilians in military courts will not be prohibited, despite the requests of human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they consider detrimental to freedom.
Blasphemy remains the responsibility, and henceforth insults are prohibited, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles anymore talks about the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Moraef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy places, the navel of the Earth and the sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the grandeur of biblical truths, modern comfort and the primordial nature.
AIF has identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Let's go to the holy places
It is worth visiting the Jordan River, in which Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that everyone who enters this “bath” receives God’s grace.
And Galilee is the place of Jesus’ miracles: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on water, calming the storm, and filling the nets.
Here Jesus appeared to the disciples and after the resurrection.
But most of all the holy things in Jerusalem.
Believers here go through the Path of Sorrow or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (Latin - Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Praetorium - where the judgment was, and through the streets of the Old City leads to the Temple of the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha - to the place of the Crucifixion, the Anointing Stone and the burial place of Jesus.
Here is the symbolic Christian Pup of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was erected on the place where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew, from which they made a cross for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the holiest place for Jews - the Wailing Wall, left over from the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different confessions leave here notes with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Make a journey on the vertical
The ruins of the fortress of Massada remained from a secret shelter from enemies, which Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on steep cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And only those who are fond of mountaineering can get to them by their own path.
The rest to this historic peak is delivered by a lift on a cable car.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, which in the winter months - a huge influx of tourists.
A shuttle bus takes him from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, pagan gods supposedly lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit the unique museums
There are about 300 museums in the country.
You don't get to see them all in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses the oldest Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the caves of the Judean Desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological artifacts.
You should also visit the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his exposition are widely presented paintings of Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akko, you can visit the Al Basha Bath Museum, which is a few halls of ancient Turkish baths with masks of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea, it is worth going to the unique private Rally Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no guides and souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are not accepted.
The fifth - the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section - the children's memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk into it, and you're in total darkness.
The stars are blinking.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Heal
Israel’s three main resort areas are located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of them has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, the Red Sea is bathed even in the winter months, since the water temperature there does not fall below 21 degrees of heat, and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and they swim there all year round.
By the way, this most extraordinary sea in the world is located at the lowest point of the planet - at 417 m below sea level.
The azure water in it is a brine that easily keeps afloat even those who do not know how to swim at all.
The scenery around here is incredibly beautiful.
Come here to undergo a course of treatment with salt water - rapa, and healing mud, and treat health with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes to put in order the shaken nerves.
Touching the Mysteries of Antiquity
They are kept by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through it passed the famous Sea Route, connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists love to wander through the narrow streets, named after the signs of the zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls on the street "your" sign, Fortune will be favorable.
In Jaffa, you can meet newlyweds coming from all over Israel and even other countries for a photo shoot.
And in Caesarea - the city of King Herod - you can wander around the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
During the Roman period, Caesarea was the principal city of Judea and the seat of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
the Tourist on the note
When going to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: in the country about 30% of the population know Russian.
It is better to take money on a trip not in euros, but in dollars, which are easy to exchange for shekels (now 1 dollar - 3.8 shekels).
Public transport is mostly buses, but there is a high-speed tram in Jerusalem, and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower City with the Upper.
It's basically an underground funicular.
Travel in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can travel with transfers for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets, shops, public transport stop working.
On Sunday morning, the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels - only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes that combine milk with meat.
It offers a large selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts made with coconut milk, traditional Jewish hummus paste, a variety of sauces, balls of ground chickpeas - falalel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israel.
But there are a lot of fed cats, which "walk on their own".
In the evening, they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Ants love crowded places and do not refuse treats.
Car rental, depending on the brand, will cost from $ 37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance, $15 a day.
A bicycle rental will cost 15 shekels. per day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Numerical language
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most come to travel and rest citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than in 2010, before the abolition of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Great and powerful" to Moscow will lead: migrants save money on language
While deputies and human rights activists argue that the law on mandatory language testing will give, fraudsters have already appeared in the country selling “lip” certificates.
Every year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support the families left at home.
From December 1, the law came into force, according to which every migrant will be obliged to pass the exam for knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the field of service, housing and communal services, household and retail trade.
However, over time, - the FMS promise - tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
At the same time, it will be necessary to pass not only the language, but also Russian history, and the foundations of legislation.
Knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed both for obtaining and for renewing a work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of those countries where Russian is the state language.
People who managed to obtain certificates and diplomas of education before the collapse of the USSR in 1991 are not subject to the law.
Use, Doom and Protection of Rights
The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, Peoples’ Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to pass tests in all cities; more than 160 such centers have already opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce testing was supported by both deputies of the state Duma and the FMS.
But human rights activists, before the law came into force, many times managed to ask the press the question: what will it actually give?
What will change the obligation of knowledge of the language for both Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all, - the representatives of the migration service answer, - this will reduce the number of people suffering from "labor slavery".
A lot of people are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the head of the representative office of the FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment system will solve the problems of foreign workers by 90%.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession, education, who do not know the language, who do not have medical certification.
Without an understanding of the language, the future migrant is doomed to face unscrupulous people who, under the guise of help, will throw him a “trip” into a terrible cramped barracks, where he and dozens of others like him will languish for months without food and documents, injecting 12-14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our immigrants.
"At home, they are promised one thing, and on arrival they are deceived, they take passports, they do not pay the promised salary," confirms Tolib Sharipov, head of the General Department of Labor Migration of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Tajikistan.
Don't fight me, asshole!
However, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics, going to work in Russia, admit that not only do not know the language of the country in which they aspire, but also on their own, they write with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as a misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get even a good primary education.
After all, their families have nothing to even feed their children, not to mention to properly dress them, put on shoes and equip them for school.
Growing up to adolescence, such guys at the first opportunity go to work.
It is difficult if you have poor knowledge of the language, - they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
However, with regard to the language law, human rights defenders note one important point.
Testing will only be carried out for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no exam or subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or Foreigners are not allowed in."
Many of the visitors claim that getting an official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is in the bureaucratic obstacles and all the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be done quickly and for only a thousand and a half.
Russian police officers know that we have mostly fake documents, no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
"Ask a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," - shared with journalists the citizen of Tajikistan Umed Khuskadamov.
"Fly, do not be stingy, buy a painting"
On the very first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it turned out that not only migrant registration documents are fake.
Several "lip" certificates of language tests have already been seized by the employees of the FMS.
Fake papers are printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, they got the new owners not for free: each of the migrants, hoping in this way to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as expensive as the official testing procedure: it will cost a labor migrant three thousand.
The fact that the main task in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that the “crotch” can not simply be bought, and the representatives of the authorities and human rights activists agree.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise guest workers who failed to successfully pass the test the first time, time to study the basic language course.
In addition, visitors who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not take into circulation the illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is extremely low
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to tighten the law on the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: To press the shots at weddings, when there were no victims, and the massacre staged by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, as a result of which seven people were killed.
Police want to ban the wearing of injuries in public places and raise the age at which you can obtain a license for weapons - from 18 years to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on security and anti-corruption Irina Yarovaya and promised that amendments to the law on weapons will be made to the state Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by “twisting the nuts”.
An open letter appeared in the network, the authors of which - representatives of various public shooting organizations - demand to abandon the "meaningless tightening".
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said the Russian service of the BBC criminal lawyer Vasily Lesnikov.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, during the six months of 2012, 142 crimes were committed with the use of firearms registered in the internal affairs bodies, while in the same period, 1,168,000 crimes were recorded.
The authors of the open letter believe that the tightening of legislation in the field of civilian weapons does not allow the criminal to go to the “black” market.
Now, according to them, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs claims that they control the situation with the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The “black” arms market is replenished through several channels.
The main such channels are five, says retired Colonel Viktor Baranec, who worked for ten years in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of the site that accepts orders for weapons
The first is an “army or military footprint”, that is, weapons that were stolen during the hostilities in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were carried by both Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranec said.
The next type of “black weapons” is stolen by criminals from representatives of law enforcement agencies.
Baranets explains that this includes both those taken from police warehouses and those stolen directly from law enforcement officers.
Illegal "barrels" go on sale from military warehouses.
Explosions frequently occurred in many military depots.
“There are proven versions that some of the arson was made specifically to cover the shortfall,” says the former military official.
According to Barants, weapons manufacturers make their contribution.
"Private weapons factories are now breeding, which can not stand the competition in the international market and throw weapons from under the floor to the black market, including Moscow," the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
Especially a lot of guns and assault rifles come from poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
“It has its own production, sometimes handicrafts, and the mafia was formed, which organized the flow,” explains the former military.
Where'd the gun come from?
Experts estimated the approximate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the “black” market.
A report on this in 2011 was prepared by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Management Design.
Experts analyzed the reporting of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological literature and open data portals on weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers write, come from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market were “at the fault of officials whose work is related to weapons,” the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of cases of weapons come from places of armed conflict, in 14% of cases there are thefts at the stage of weapons production, 5% fall on “black archaeology”.
A salesman-consultant of one of the gun shops, who asked not to be named, assures that the weapons found by black miners have not been bought for a long time - too old.
Most often, as he says, after the new party, sellers go to a military warehouse.
Through the ensign, a person buys a unit, for example, a TT gun.
It's written to him, transmitted through the fence.
“He transports it to the city and here he sells 900 euros for a piece with two shops,” he says.
"However, the police are aware of all cases, so periodically when a plan for the disclosure of crimes is burning, they conduct a control purchase from dealers of illegal weapons," the consultant adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through acquaintances.
I looked at the sites, blogs, until a friend responded, who offered to come to the platform "Begovaya", where there will be a person who will take me to the "corner", where we will bargain.
I only found out the price of the gun there.
Viktor Baranets
To get the gun, I need an acquaintance who has a way out, - says the sales consultant. - I have such an acquaintance, but I'm not sure about it.
There are sellers in the markets, but you also need to come there, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to convey that his daughter's tooth fell out."
I'm even getting a couple of castes now through a man I'm sure of.
He also supplies them only to me, because he knows that I will not give him up.
Newbies look for weapons in a variety of ways.
Former military Viktor Baranec tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing to publish an article about it.
Schemes, he said, have not changed.
He was given a photo album with "anything."
“I felt like I was in a luxury store,” recalls the military man.
According to Barants, the buyer is not offered a cat in a bag - everything can be tried.
I, a potential client, do not just buy - we go with the seller to the forest, there we put a target.
“I am given the opportunity to shoot, and when I am convinced that the weapon is hitting well, we begin to bargain,” the expert describes the procedure.
Shop on the couch
Search engines on the Internet are displayed on sites and groups in "Vkontakte", where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
This does not require any documents and personal meetings.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," - write in the advertising cap on the site "Buy a combat gun or machine gun."
On it, users leave their applications and ask questions.
Will they be sold to minors?
"Without a license of course," asks the user "Ivan" (the spelling is saved).
"I buy TT.Moscow" - concisely formulates the request "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has now scattered a huge network of fake sites and wishing to buy combat weapons paddle shovel.
People go like hungry fish to feed, and then extract coal in Siberia
Military Observer and Former Military Victor Baranec
I have heard about such schemes: usually the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes a payment through an ATM.
“In response, they send a photo and instructions where the weapons are hidden,” said Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the Right to Arms NGO.
Victor Baranec claims that leaving the application on the site, you can remain unarmed and get behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has now scattered a huge network of fake sites and wishing to buy combat weapons paddle shovel.
“People go like hungry fish to feed, and then they extract coal in Siberia,” he says.
Macarons for $100
When buying illegal small arms, according to experts, it is possible to settle in the amount of from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the organization "Right to Arms", the Makarov gun can be purchased for $ 100-300.
We'll have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from long-term storage warehouses by the management of these middle-level warehouses.
According to the official statistics of the agency, in comparison with January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousand, and the number of revealed facts of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States strike workers fast food and supermarkets
Up to a quarter of all American teenagers go through McDonald’s.
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages has swept across America at Walmart’s department stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as McDonald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy’s, and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
So far, no one is going to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth shaft or it is destined to exhale in the early stages.
The action is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries that ordinary Walmart employees and fast food systems receive, the goal of the organizers of the protests is to create trade union organizations in them.
So far, this sector of the economy is almost not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The action began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called “Black Friday”, when an orgy of cheap sales hit America, capturing millions of ordinary people and sometimes accompanied by brawls.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs and picketed along with trade unions and left-wing activists the stores of the corporation, whose goods are designed for people of modest and average income.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many low-wage Walmart workers only make money at work.
The availability and range of products made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the product to the retailer in part because it pays little to its employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, for example, the lack of forklifts or hand scanners.
Black Friday participants demanded a pay rise and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation jumped from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee receiving $9.5 an hour is out of pocket, they said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley prove that if Walmart raises the average salary to $ 12 per hour, it will cost the corporation $ 3.2 billion.
That’s about 1.1 percent more than she spends on wages now.
If Walmart completely shifts the increase in wages to the shoulders of customers, then each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
In a year, they will spend some $12.39 more than they do now.
Supporters of Walmart quite note that the protests occurred in only nine states and did not cause the corporation the slightest damage.
“Black Friday” lasted in her stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers made almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
In an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post, Dan Vogelman said that fewer than five Walmart employees had left their jobs and that the protest was just another PR stunt organized by the union.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their target was not Walmart stores (they are not to be pitied in this progressive city, and therefore they are not here yet), and McDonald’s and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s says it sells billions of servings, and after that it doesn’t even give you sick leave and doesn’t pay you for honest work!
Jumaine Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage, under federal and New York law, is $7.25 an hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing it over time, but not much, and on average their ordinary workers receive in New York 8.90 dollars per hour.
No one earns less in this expensive city.
How it is possible to exist in New York for such money is incomprehensible to me.
Once through McDonald's passed almost a quarter of American teenagers who worked on their shelves after school, while living with their parents.
Few saw this as the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I constantly come across interviews with McDonald’s employees who complain that they should live on this salary and sometimes even feed their children on it.
On the other hand, on the forum of the Wall Street Journal there is a comment, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you will feed them.
Protesters, who began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and cooks of the fast-food system start paying at least $15 an hour, more than doubling their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be established in the field of fast food.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing and punishing union activists with pickpocketing and firings.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes their lives easier.
But to cover the union fast food is difficult and for objective reasons.
One of the main ones is the unusual fluctuation of personnel.
Disagreements
Noisy protests took place on this day and at a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The rally culminated in a mid-day rally at McDonald's near Times Square, which was attended by several local Democratic politicians, in particular, City Council member Jumaine Williams, who said: "McDonald's" says that he sells billions of servings, and after that he does not even give you sick leave and does not pay you for the honor!"
Other prominent New York Democrats, such as New York City mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, supported the demonstrators, saying that “we must stand together in support of fast food workers so that they get the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!”
As described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But it involved only a few hundred people, and not all of them were employees of fast food, which in New York employs tens of thousands of people.
It is not yet clear whether this spark will ignite the mass movement.
"While cheating the brain turns out to be average"
The topic of augmented reality, which is popular among fans of modern technologies, has recently been perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At first, in the summer at its annual conference, the current model was shown by Google, and then in November it became known that Microsoft also applied for the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the group of interactive 3D-technology in the Cambridge laboratory Microsoft Sharam Izadi, it follows that for scientists of this company glasses - passed stage.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
Can you tell us more about what your research team is doing?
- We are engaged in human-machine interaction, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
While humanity in the mass is stuck in the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes ticking them with your finger.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate fundamental changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not sold without Kinect, because everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else is ahead of us?
Despite the fact that Kinect has moved the interaction to the physical level, a lot is still happening on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is not yet very good.
We are trying to change this, we are working on true three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projective ones.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world, make it more tangible.
To do this, however, you need to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all - to hell with these stupid virtual reality helmets!
What do you think about voice control?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it overrated?
- It definitely can not be called a panacea - the question of privacy arises, because you do not always want to notify others about their actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interactions with computers are good, but each in its own niche.
For example, for the management of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about sweeping, but about such stingy, short ones.
At the same time, the gestures were not removed by the camera of the device, but by a wristband that recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
While it is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future is a mixed type of control, for example, gesture + voice.
- Is that what it is?
For example, how are you going to ask me to give you this can of soda?
You say it and show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it's gonna be very hard to tell.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can not at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think in the near future we will mainly have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to more accurately determine human reactions.
It can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, this is very important.
- Speaking of your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your complaints about modern cameras?
Lack of resolution, depth, or anything else?
- In principle, the current generation is something that can be started in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixels 8 at a speed of 1000 hp.
But it is not about the megapixels themselves, but as a matrix and depth.
From the latter point of view, all the current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the designers of algorithms.
That is, it is necessary to remember not only about the resolution on the axes X and Y, but also Z.
Also very important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 hp is frankly not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen Bettiches from our Redmond laboratory made a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay - from 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction of humans and machines.
I would be very useful in my work the equivalent of such a device, only it does not require touching, so that the frames per second were larger.
Do you need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the second is a receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is, in fact, the usual sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or increase it by increasing the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue of Kinect, play with the curvature of the camera location and see how this will help in the three-dimensional determination of the position.
As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that in terms of everyday use of augmented reality technology, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking around all the time with your smartphone in your hands is not very convenient, but here's what I think: the coolest option would be a "transition" augmented reality, when based on a cloud platform you could switch from glasses to a smartphone, a projection display and then everywhere else.
Glasses are a very personal device, this is their strength (private things only you see), and at the same time weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from "Iron Man", but also to a mere mortal.
There is one problem that is often pointed out by critics of such an idea: there is no tactile response!
The hands can't feel anything!
What answers is your group preparing for this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction of man and machine.
I think the eighth may well be the addition of tactile sensations.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a kind of substrate for the image.
She's a great presser!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at giving these "pictures in the air" palpability - for example, the interference of several directed ultrasonic rays at a certain point where the finger is, gives a feeling, but so far it is very weak - as if you were blown to the pillows.
There are bracelets on the wrists, which affect the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
Have you tried to trick the brain?
Make him think he feels what he's supposed to feel the moment he sees something?
That’s a good idea, we haven’t tried that yet.
Here lies another task, which has to fight for a long time - how to make a person physically in a very limited space, to believe that he is walking on an open, almost endless - we are working on the concepts of treadmills (not at all like in clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
While cheating the brain turns out to be average, the work is still very much for many years.
That’s what makes working on virtual reality so appealing to a researcher – many things in an absolutely rudimentary state.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
“Rosbalt” continues the project “Petersburg avant-garde”, dedicated to the citizens who are in front, in the vanguard of culture and art.
This top list has already included bright figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing all-Russian fame.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the outrageous artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller - a bearded man dressed in all red, which is found either at the Russian Museum, then at the Summer Garden, then at fashionable parties and vernissages.
The paintings of Kirill Miller always gather crowds of spectators, wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of the purely St. Petersburg socio-philosophical storytellers, the creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, his appearance on the streets causing a smile among the townspeople, lifting everyone's mood.
Recently, he took in the hands of a charmer and became a Petersburg charmer, as he matured for this complex role with all his bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why do you still walk around the city in all the red, and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose red as a fashion designer, engaged in the view and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, the image maker, and society.
Although in society everything that is not a little gray causes aggression and arousal of an unkind property.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in DK Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I knew this was my path.
Then the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and the new, free ones like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-Gaza region, which led to Pushkinskaya-10, and there was no more wave.
I am thrown into the theater, clothes, music, into all genres except the word.
- It was important for me to find myself in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces should gather.
In 1995, I occupied the territory on Pushkinskaya-10, and there, until there was no repair, there was a music and art club, a bohemian club, the house of the St. Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: NOWe, Tequila jazz, remember how the Cord was brought with the project "Van Gogh's Ear".
The cord and his friends sang light songs under the plywood, they were in a tight-fitting leotard, among them was the fashionable now composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was the host of many programs until the Hali-Galivian times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career went on, and he received basic education and upbringing from us.
Gallery "D 137", the club "Griboedov" are echoes from the Art Clinic.
That's where our employees and regulars went.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the award was "People of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was named, my climax ended.
In the new times, according to the old rules, it is uncomfortable to work, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our years, it is easy to become popular, but the culture and popularity are divided, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work has a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a pronounced relevance and sharpness.
I'm going to have a program exhibition, The Russian Museum in Clowns.
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, now to be social is painful and scary.
But in clowns everything is smeared, tragedy is removed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through totalitarian dressing in order.
Now on clothes meet, focusing on external mechanics, and not on the inner man.
Or maybe he can't give a hand and spit in the face.
And the deception will be removed with the help of changing clothes.
- And recently we saw you as a city charmer. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, if not me, they are.
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art should be neat, tactical, sweet.
There is a disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people used to fight in packs, bohemians loved one thing, and simpletons loved another.
Now everyone is broken into microcommunities, now it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar piece of paper to be liked by everyone.
Now you have to think about who will like you.
Now each cult hero has 100 fans.
- And on Stas Mikhailov comes several thousand!
- It's where the sex and social sphere works.
And on cultural soil, 300 people will come, and 10 thousand will not come, and as a result, less management, money, everything will die.
I have fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the gain.
I wrote such paintings in my youth that one collector had them on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with the pictures that usually end.
Concepts are often confused.
They say: spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
There's no culture of consumption, it's from another opera.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money for the sake of painting.
I am for that culture.
- Kirill, what's missing from St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a concept: an official from culture.
However, not all of them can be involved in culture.
With the right kings, things were not like that, the kings may not have understood the culture very well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are pushed, because we need higher experts who will correctly evaluate these experts and give them a way.
Now the taste buds are flourishing.
The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What is it for you - Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is soil there.
And on our stones, art is difficult to grow.
We need cultural ground, and we have more writers now than readers, it’s wrong.
Here in Europe there are a lot of people who are curious, who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer of thin.
We need to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented with the help of a grant from St. Petersburg
Giving birth in space
The land is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earthlings on board are sent in search of a spare planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question arises, how to continue your kind in the conditions of weightlessness or on the same reserve planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact, these planets are only two that can be mastered at least hypothetically.
“This is Venus and Mars,” said Vladimir Surdin, a senior researcher at the P.K. Sternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAISH).
But if conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, then on the surface of Venus - temperatures of 500 degrees.
You can live only at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Approaching the issues of reproduction in space began with the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of pea grown in orbit were no different from their terrestrial varieties.
Then - the introduction into orbit of insects, tiny fruit flies-drosophyll.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to test how an embryo develops under weightlessness.
We get a perfectly normal chick at the exit.
And then the problem begins.
"The problem related to the fact that this chick should find support, he should stand on his feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Unable to find any support, the chicks squirmed wildly.
And after 10 hours, the newborns had a complete atrophy of instincts.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was that after four days they just died.
"And twice we hatched the chicks, then refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," says the failure of the experiment with chicks in space Vladimir Sychev.
With animals, the last time a biological “mini-chicken” flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" will be only same-sex individuals.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space already with the fruit.
In principle, there was nothing supernatural.
"It was on biosatellites, but again - this is a single experiment, and such studies should be carried out," - said Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
But to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space is not yet possible.
It's not an easy task.
Animals, losing their habitual habitat, simply can not realize their sexual instinct.
Humans, unlike animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is able to create a proper emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not conducted.
Women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female body.
Our Seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could say whether it would survive after the flight into space.
Will she be able to have a baby after this flight?
“No one answered this question,” says Vakhtang Vachnadze, a veteran of the rocket and space industry.
In June 1964, just a year after the space flight, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child Andrian Nikolaev was also an astronaut.
In 1988, the second woman-cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice visited orbit and even worked in outer space, had a son.
But the risk remains.
We have a small number, there are cosmonauts who, after long flights, everything has cost, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," sums up the pilot-cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
And yet, humanity needs to look for some new ways in biotechnology, protection from radiation, the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrolaboratory CPC - a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in conditions of zero buoyancy, astronauts are practicing their skills in open space.
Water imitates weightlessness.
If for adults water, albeit comfortable, but still a foreign environment, then for infants - a native element.
Small ichthyanders seem to confirm that life on land came out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months in the mother in the amniotic fluid, it is easier for him to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first bathing, it takes only 2 weeks.
“It’s very little to forget something,” says baby swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short, if for the born child weightlessness is a more natural state, then for a woman - gravity, gravity is necessary.
Very quickly in weightlessness, the muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, the ability to push the fetus falls.
Okay, let's drop that, too, relying on birth stimulants.
You can, of course, in a special cell to go to the birth, she will push him.
"And then what?" asks non-trivial questions Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earth's attraction, the body will not form a skeleton and a muscular system.
It is impossible for a newborn in orbit, as an adult, to wear a special training suit.
He will simply be deprived of what he needs.
"And this experiment, which we will go to, allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring to Earth a disabled, completely maladapted person," predicts Igor Pestov, head of the Bioethics Committee of IMBP RAS.
So far, the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, after a while it will be a reality when earthlings on their ships will go to a distant planet, which will be home to their descendants born in space.
Chief of the Main Control and Audit Department: The check of the Schwartz system failed due to the fault of politicians.
In the public procurement sector, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the existence of quality legislation, lags behind in its application.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kal, Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview for the website Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
“The law will never be perfect, but it should be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have enough”, – commented on the current situation Kala.
Such conclusions are provided by the joint inspection of the Czech and German control authorities.
As an example of incorrect practice, the approach of Peter Nechas to the so-called swartz system is cited.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP (Civil Democratic Party) will not bother entrepreneurs with inspections - is it prohibited or allowed?
“The law should be established in some way, and if it prohibits something, then the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of the institutions, which are charged with the duty to verify and enforce the fulfillment of obligations,” says Kala.
At the meeting of the audit committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German sides, in which the legislation on public procurement of both countries was compared.
What specifically was it about?
This is a parallel check that we started probably two years ago.
Simply put, European law states how public procurement should be carried out, followed by national legislation and then also the application in practice.
All the information was collected and, even with the still incomplete verification, interesting differences were found - in other words, the legislation we have can be "accurate and infallible", but in practice we are inferior to Germany in some respects.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
How can this project help you, what does it mean to you?
It is precisely such joint control that can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of laws, reduce and improve restrictions, because this does not lead to a positive result.
Economics means getting the right thing for a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But not the fact that we will achieve this by reducing the restriction of orders.
Perhaps this system will be filled with “papers” so that those who wish to find loopholes in this system will find them much easier than if the restriction had not decreased.
You are talking about internal problems of practical application of the legislation on public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there such an organization as our CRO (Control and Audit Office) or does it work differently?
As far as the institutions are concerned, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is based on our principle, serves as our CRO, and there is also a collegium that works a little differently, but basically both institutions function in a similar way.
In addition, the powers are to a certain extent similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units at the level of the federal states - in this their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the Federal Accounts Chambers.
As for local legislation, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a model, but it can not be definitely said that it is better in everything.
Is that because they're better at controlling?
Definitely not, but again, I do not like such comparisons.
But it must be said that even exemplary countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any benefit from working with our office, right?
If we talk about domestic legislation, how did the amendments to the Law on Public Procurement affect your institution, how do the consequences manifest themselves?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is rather short, it has not yet manifested itself in our control work.
Since we are monitoring the fact, it is necessary to take into account some delay.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future audits - we began to use our new tool "detection of the risk of non-economy", through which we drove almost 14,000 government contracts. We analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will manifest themselves, because the restrictions change, the conditions of some types of tenders and so on.
Do you think that the adoption of this law will bring benefit or additional burden on the system of bureaucracy?
I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules will become “harder” and it will be impossible to comply with them.
In the functioning of the previous rules, controlled enterprises are associated with the supplier (for example, regional operational programs - with the regional council) in that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement means a violation of budgetary discipline.
Is it necessary to tighten the law in this way?
I don't think it's that way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system will only put more pressure on the bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP will not bother entrepreneurs with checks of the so-called Schwartz system. What does this mean?
Is the "Schwarz system" banned or allowed?
The law should be established in some way, and if it prohibited something, the Prime Minister could not resist the work of the bodies charged with verifying and enforcing compliance.
You can say, "We will change this law and solve it," but you can't say that we will pretend that nothing is happening.
The Law on Public Procurement contains quite strict rules on how and what should be formally conducted, and this is correct. This will protect public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack.
The roads are slippery in some places, but mostly passable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowy.
They are mostly passable, but in some places with more caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
This morning in the Karlovy Vary region the roads were passable, but in some places frozen and snowy.
The temperature has dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day should be slightly warmer.
Snowfall in the region has stopped, only in the lowlands lies a small layer.
However, on the ridges of the Ore Mountains lies about 30 centimeters of snow.
From the information received from regional road workers, it became known that in some places there was lower visibility due to fog.
The R6 expressway and first-class roads in the region are currently unrestricted.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges, where the surface can be frosty and slippery.
Also, all roads belonging to the second and third classes, including mountain trails, are passable.
But in some of their areas, there are still remnants of frozen and snow-covered places.
You need to be especially careful on the roads located on the hills.
Pardubice and Kralovegrad Region
The Roads and Highways Administration of the Czech Republic on its pages on the Internet informs that some roads in the eastern Czech Republic are threatened with ice, and on mountain roads and roads located on highlands, there may be a run-down layer of snow.
Regional road workers warn drivers about ice, which can form especially on the heights of the Pardubice region.
The ice can be near Lanschkron, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlice, Polica, Svitavy or Vysoké Mito, especially on second and third class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34, located in Svitavy, are treated with chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads of the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e and Orlicke mountains.
The snow-covered layer is located on the roads located on the hills in the areas of Rihnov nad Kneznou and Trutnov.
In the eastern Czech Republic today variable cloud cover without precipitation.
The temperature usually varies from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, light wind.
Plze<0xC5><0x88> Region
The roads in the Plze<0xC5><0x88> region are passable this morning, but in some places you need to be careful and adapt to the weather.
In the morning it is frosty, the temperature ranges from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling, it can be slippery in some places.
In some places, drivers may face fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
Information was provided by regional road workers.
The D5 highway is now almost unlimited, however, road operators recommend to be careful between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In southern Plze<0xC5><0x88> and Tachov can get frozen areas.
The roads of the second and third classes are wet, and also in this case there is a warning in connection with the possibility of the appearance of slippery areas.
Drivers should be careful, especially on the little-used roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava area.
Olomouck<0xC3><0xBD> kraj
Drivers heading to the heights of the Olomouc region, today should take into account the snow on the road.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Chervenogorsk saddle and on the road in the direction of Videlsky Krshizh.
At night, snowfall forced to go out on the street road workers, according to information from the road management, in Shumperk fell about three centimeters of snow.
In other areas of the edge of the road, as a rule, pass without restrictions.
"On the heights of Shumperk lie the remains of snow.
Drivers heading towards Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k should keep in mind the presence of snow porridge in the Chervenogorsk saddle," the dispatcher of the Sumperk road management told CHAN (Czech News Agency) today.
At night, their colleagues from Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k went to clear the roads, they assured that the roads on the hills after treatment with chemicals remained naked and wet.
In Olomouc, the roads are passable without restrictions, but in Sternberg drivers should be careful in forest areas where there is still moisture.
<0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem Region, Liberec Region
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia report that there are several hard-to-reach places left.
According to the information from the police database, in addition to several places with ice or fallen snow, a mountain road is closed at the site of the Telnitsa clinic in the Ustets region.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the lowlands, so snow and ice remain on the roads. In the lowlands, especially south-east of the Czech Srednegora, on the contrary, there are no problems, the roads are mostly dry.
Complications on the roads have not yet been reported.
Road workers report the appearance of ice in the vicinity of Shtety.
According to meteorologists, ideal conditions were created for its formation at night - it rained all day and melted snow, at night the sky cleared and frosts began.
Unfavorable conditions are reported on the main highway and on the I/13 highway on the border of the Ustecky and Liberec regions.
Due to the branches of trees that were bent under the snow layer, which were connected to the road itself, they were forced to close the road in Telnica on Kninica.
Simon Ornest: We want to accumulate positive energy at concerts
What do you think the end of the world should be in less than a month?
This is just one of the many disturbing news that we humans find so easily.
Together with The Tap Tap, we constantly joke about this topic and say that we are the only group in the world that will be able to collect enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell the readers more about this?
This is a nationwide fund-raising event that we have been planning for two years now.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that the Mayan calendar has, the end of which is announced on December 21 at 11:10.
The day before this event, on December 20 at 21:00, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava will start in parallel.
They will end, roughly speaking, when the May calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, whose time zone is 12 hours earlier than ours.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially, this was my idea, then we all came up with our artist Gonza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state in which this world we will one day pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we have created a unique collection of items from shoes, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These things can be bought on the website www.e-tap.cz and thus at the same time provide us with support.
The band The Tap Tap along with other musicians also performed the anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The end of the world is canceled".
Will the anthem, already beloved by YouTube listeners, be played at these benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if in the end everything works out and the end of the world does not come.
It is sung by all the performers at all the concerts at the same time.
The anthems will also be played live on Czech television.
The words to this song were written and played the role of Jesus in the clip Tomas Ganak, also involved in the performance of Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We also cooperate with other persons of Czech cultural life, as we hold many charity events and concerts.
We try to actively involve them in these projects.
It turned out that many people like to work with us, they are interested.
What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world?
For the purchase of equipment for the barrier-free educational center STUDIO, for the sixth year we have been working with the Tap civic association at the Edli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the schools of the Edli<0xC4><0x8D>ki Institute and hold fun and interesting events with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and in this way we try to provide them with this opportunity.
As part of the project of additional construction of the Edli<0xC4><0x8D>ki Institute, a separate building will be built in the future, to which we will move with this project.
Several musical groups and performers will perform at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We have tried to create a program that will interest all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiri Suchi will perform in Prague.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such “great events” in the future?
In May, we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring Festival and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would love to perform at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the United States, would very much like to perform in Washington and Chicago.
You have serious plans for foreign countries, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you deal with the road in terms of organization and logistics??
It is not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five participants in electric wheelchairs, their strollers must travel in the luggage compartment, plus a large number of cargo and tool boxes.
Nevertheless, so far we managed to do it without any problems. Czech airlines <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways have always been excellently prepared for us, which surprised me many times.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went without problems.
Thanks to traveling abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes towards people with disabilities, and so on.
What have you been facing so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where everything works better than ours, in Russia we have witnessed that in the east is still at a basic level.
Compared to Prague, there are a lot of barriers in Moscow, and here is still a wonder of independent movement of a person in an electric wheelchair in the city center.
Also, there are no such banal things as giving way to a disabled person in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already public organizations that are trying to draw people’s attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And what, on the contrary, do we constantly have to catch up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things whose level of performance is far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those people to whom it concerns.
In London and Madrid it is quite normal that people with severe disabilities move on their own on the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, and anywhere else.
It is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, in this we are a little ahead of them with The Tap Tap!
Respecting the public or being barrier-free is one thing, but the moment there are famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers among us, then everything will really start to change.
So far, these are isolated cases - people with a strong will.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but back two years ago, what made you organize it in 1998?
I entered the Institute of Edli<0xC4><0x8D>ka as an educator, there were many young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I am a musician myself and play, including the saxophone, I, together with a colleague, organized an interesting music club.
Well, over time, as our host Ladja Angelovic says, it got a little out of control (laughs).
Has the popularity only come in recent years, or am I confusing something?
It is true, we were helped by the fact that we began to join the famous singers and actively work on the propaganda of the group.
We have come to the conclusion that work that no one can appreciate, in fact, as if it does not exist.
Thanks to the funds of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Did you have a goal to promote The Tap Tap so well?
From the very beginning, I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
Show business is full of things imitating each other.
This is logical, everything new is taken with caution, and it lasts for a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us, of course, pity, it is natural ...
But this pity is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not some suffering and all abandoned personalities that we should pity.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities succeed, it is a shift not only for them, but for society as a whole.
Has being a strict leader, as you are considered by many, ensured success?
If we want to do the job well, we must be uncompromising in many things and keep a certain discipline.
But I think that's normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and fly in the clouds, and when they find out that twice a week they have to go to rehearsals, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose enthusiasm.
But this happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
There are currently 20 members of The Tap Tap.
How many were there in the beginning of 1998?
There's only one Lady Angelovich.
We are an open group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.
For those who have the desire and strength of will, our doors are always open.
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will be held in Prague at the Incheba stadium, in Brno - at the Fléda club and Ostrava - in the center of Plynojem with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians of the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by a teleconference at the time of the performance of The Tap Tap's song "The End of the World is Cancelled".
The purpose of this project is to raise funds in the amount of 25 million crowns for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDIO educational center at the Jedlicka Institute in Prague.
The concert ticket costs 400 CZK, admission is free for children under 12 years old. Tickets can be purchased in advance at Bohemianticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was accepted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on September 12, 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and in the following years took an active part in a number of projects of the Agency.
But the path to space Poland began much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in space flights, but this was not always met with understanding.
Let me recall, for example, the lecture by A. Sternfeld, who on December 6, 1933 presented at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory the ideas from his groundbreaking work “Introduction to Cosmonautics”.
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after a few years Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltri and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for "Introduction to Astronautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966), mentioned above, later became a great propagandist of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and has written a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became a well-known global space propagandist, and his contribution was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925, a railway track was built in Poland, equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether a rocket was to be used to accelerate or brake the cart.
Information about this train is known only from the press of that era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to think about missile arrows.
The research was carried out by the Section of Armament Engineering in cooperation with Professors Mieczys<0xC5><0x82>aw Wolfke and Gustav Mok<0xC5><0xBC>ycki.
From the preserved materials it can be seen that the studies have reached the stage of practical tests.
But with the arrival of the German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, in a specialized press, the idea of a photoelectric fighter rocket, which was proposed by an engineer Rogozinsky, appeared, and the following year the work "Air Torpedo Rocket and Air Bomb Rocket" by Leliva-Kzhivoblotsky was published.
Both projects were developed for the military use of rocket engines.
Before the war, all projects for the military use of rocketry were carried out by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all work.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, the work ended due to the outbreak of war.
The next scientific work devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautychne).
For the first time about society is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the magazine "Problems", which publishes four voluminous articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich proposed to organize a society that would be engaged in astronautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already gaining momentum, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (POA) has been trying to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951), and already in the fall of the POA became its full member.
The following year, Kazimierz Zarankevich (1902-1959), the first chairman of the POA, became deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained in this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, POA has made a significant contribution to the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket RM (Meteorological Rocket), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The missile, capable of covering a distance of 1800 m, was about 80 cm long, and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, a two-stage RM-2 missile was tested on the Bled wasteland.
This rocket was about 1.4 m long, and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was already able to engage in real scientific work - the RM-34 missile could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was to monitor the high-altitude wind.
But in 1962, further development was suspended.
The successor to the first RM-type missiles was the Meteor-1 missile, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was conceived as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (designated Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in the size of the chamber for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B - 0.34 liters, and Meteor-1C - 0.62 liters.
The maximum flight range of all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Institute of Aviation carried out the development of the Meteor-2 rocket, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with a starting weight of 380 kg was able to bring a payload weighing 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Then, versions of Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to COSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
In addition, within the framework of the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
Repeal of the public works law is not the solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the Public Works Act.
The decision sparked a lively debate in the community.
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader point of view.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital along with unrestrained financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the cost of labor (wages), price tension arises.
Under this concept, we need to understand the state when the producer, through the delivery of cheap goods, tries to withstand economic competition by “disrupting” the value of the competitor in order to take away most of the market and, thus, increase its own income.
On a massive scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either moving production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearing. As a result, unemployment increases in those countries where the cost of labor, compared to others, is high.
Since private capital does not bear any social responsibility, including for the unemployment it produces, the inevitable expenses of the state for social needs grow.
In general, the situation reinforces the reluctance of employers to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the social and economic damage caused by their pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistical data.
Unceremonious methods of private capital create at the level of the economies of individual states situations when the governments of countries are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments surrender their own populations to private capital, despite social decline.
This is reflected primarily in changes in the current legislation.
The aim is to economically force its people to submit to the dictates of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
It acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for reducing the rights of workers in the field of labor legislation.
As a result, the level of poverty increases, and at the same time the gap between the poor and the rich increases.
In Germany, for several years, there has been a public distribution of food to the poor, who are unable to feed themselves with their own labor.
The number of these people is already approaching one million.
Within the framework of improving the competitiveness of the German economy, there are constantly cases when employed people receive such a salary that the state must pay them extra to get a living wage.
Such a scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional employees of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in social status are forced either to emigrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or to exist on a beggarly wage in the margins of society in the hope that private investment capital will one day come to the country.
But the question is, where will it come from?
If the capital comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, since a Chinese, a Hindu, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian, an African still works for a share of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media are sickeningly asserting that the state cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that a managed economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital persists in insisting that the state should not intervene in the economy by controlling actions.
The next question to be answered is whether private capital, which now practically governs politics and the state as a whole, is acting for its own selfish purposes?
The unequivocal answer is yes.
The proof is the existence of almost all-powerful and ubiquitous lobbies in all states.
As a result, we have a desperate situation, manifested in corruption, ensuring mutual benefits, in legislation, where almost everything deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is such that government ministries, due to a lack of financial resources, entrust the development of draft laws to private law firms that are closely connected with industry.
Then these bills are approved by the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people, as the constitution of the Western type says, but from financially powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that liberal-oriented democracy is now rapidly finding itself in a situation as described by Appian in The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Days of Caesar and Pompey: “The state has long since disintegrated, and agencies are engaged in violence.
Bribery, illegal taking of favors with stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold vote "... decent people did not run for the post of ruler at all, in the end one day the state itself was left without a consul for eight months. . . . "Seriously began to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation was the autocracy and the need to choose an energetic person ".
As in ancient times, modern society is dominated by its own reckless interests without taking into account public interests.
Private capital is no longer inherently intended for public use.
The current result is no different from the past: the unprecedented decline of the elite without any effort to carry out reforms of a deeper nature.
Hence the cause of fascist and communist regimes must be sought in the reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal democracy can be perceived as a certain pause, after which the next round is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the governance of the state and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
“Nothing comes out of violence, and nothing can ever come out of it” – Sting, the song “Fragiles”, where the main verse of the refrain are the words: “we do not forget how fragile we are”.
“If my sons didn’t want wars, they wouldn’t exist.” – Meier Amschel Rothschild’s wife Gutel Schnaper
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, has elicited many responses.
Some argue for Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defence, while the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that it is the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is credited with the role of a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on who, in these recurrent waves of killings, is the perpetrator and who is the victim, after all, today's citizens of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born at the time of the current political situation and did not witness the onset of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look behind the curtain, to look at who is primarily served by the 95-year-long tension (counting from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of land in the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is supported by historical facts, some of them are derived on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is above all the history of the struggle for power.
In each epoch we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear - whether these people have always taken their own steps, or behind their throne was someone who directed their actions to predetermined goals.
It must be admitted that we are living at a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of a few persons, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have taken place in a generation.
Among the astronomically rich families stands out one that could be regarded as the head of a squire (I do not know if anyone is standing above them, but this is not excluded) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Of course I do.
The first news agency (Reuters) they bought in the 90-ies of the 19th century to stop the rumors linking their name to criminal activities in the higher spheres in which they were in the shadow, and which have always led to the strengthening of their power, the multiplication of wealth or both.
They have large stakes in almost all central banks in the world, and against countries in whose central banks they do not have their share, they are waging or preparing a war (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but at the same time the Russian government took the central bank of their country into their own hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain the status of a central bank behind the Rothschild Bank of America, during the Civil War he began to issue his own (you know - government) money and was assassinated in 1865 in a theater.
John F. Kennedy began to issue his own money and wanted to abolish the FED (Federal Reserve System), was killed in 1963. Deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for unleashing the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to the development of a plan for three world wars, created by the great 33rd level Freemason Albert Pike.
The task of the first war was the destruction of the monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially Great Britain, and the third was to reduce the world population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number of slaves would be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they would not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism can be absolutely nothing but a prerequisite for such a project).
The method by which the group of the richest families, led by the Rothschilds, works is to challenge the crisis and then propose solutions (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the Fed’s founding, which was supposed to prevent a repeat of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they succeeded in unleashing the First World War through the assassination of the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed tsarist Russia, starting the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified capitulation of Germany (there was no longer any need for war to destroy tsarist Russia) and, as a result, the Central European power, Austria-Hungary, was split.
To facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation by imposing huge military reparations on Germany, which created a prerequisite for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then it remained only to give the Germans a strong enough, convicting the guilty and offering simple solutions to the Leader, further creating a multinational Czechoslovakia with a really strong German minority.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the foundation of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created the precondition for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes with the local Arab population began to occur.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke out of the chains in which he was originally held by the bankers, or everything he did was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by war reparations for World War II, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create a hotbed of war for the third.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish people, as in the Second World War, will fall victim to the fighting on the front line, now together with the Arab or, more simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only inside the country, but also at the international level (take only the sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence, if it all began with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
Here, it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers push people to vote exclusively for their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of a fascist, loyal to international bankers politician, doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will also threaten to grow into a world conflict, and given Iran's control over the Strait of Hormuz 2 percent of the world's oil reserves.
David Rockefeller said in 1994: “All we need is a general crisis, and people will accept a new world order.”
The New World Order in their view is a world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every born organism is implanted at birth with a chip, with which it becomes a being under total control.
“And he causes all small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to have a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, so that a man who is not marked with the name of the beast or the number of his name may neither buy nor sell.
This is wisdom: everyone who has understanding can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to the name of a man, and the number is six hundred and sixty-six.
"Operation Argo": When there is nowhere worse, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist student protesters seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the ousted Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution in the United States, which had been the patron saint of his regime for decades.
For the US administration, the positive outcome of the situation was not expected - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it could fundamentally undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, to achieve the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was unable.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by an unsuccessful attempt to free the hostages by force.
The prisoners were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
Their fate caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
The defeat in Iran contributed greatly to Jimmy Carter's defeat in the 1980 presidential election, which culminated in the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, directed by actor Ben Affleck, “Operation Argo” describes one episode of the story that brought America small victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six employees managed to escape.
After difficult journeys, they ended their journey at the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, with the help of an extravagant cover legend, according to which they traveled on Canadian passports as members of the filming team, looking for a place in the country for filming a sci-fi epic.
Combination of genres
The plan, which was invented by “evacuation” expert Tony Mendes, demanded Hollywood’s cooperation.
In order for the legend to be true, specialized magazines wrote about the project of the film, held press conferences, a fictional production company had a real office.
Details of the operation have long been kept secret, a film based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
Affleck’s film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political thriller, the so-called "film-cinema opus", the story of a successful idea, a scam - an example can be a number of films about Ocean's friends.
The film constantly changes the mood - on the one hand, documentary scenes from Tehran (the credits show iconic historical photos of events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, lightened Hollywood passages intersect with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then scenes from CIA headquarters and other agencies - men in suits discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, on the stairs of institutions, by phone ...
Ben Affleck has had a great career restart.
From a derided actor, he became a respected director, and his play ceased to be an object of ridicule.
"Operation Argo" is his third feature film, after the dark detective "Goodbye, Baby, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The City" (2010).
At the same time, this is the first Affleck film that is not shot in the director’s hometown of Boston.
The feeling of the atmosphere of the place at the same time refers to the qualities that elevated the earlier films of the director above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck is showing it in Argo, where Tehran is playing Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, during the reconstruction of real events - the opening scenes of the fall of the embassy impress with their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arise when somewhere suddenly the story changes.
Affleck and his colleagues achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (a fake headquarters in a Tehran bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not involve many exciting scenes of cinematic significance.
He works quite successfully with this few, sometimes something comes up - there it all does not work out so elegantly (the scene in which a phone call in America prevents the impending crisis at the airport of Tehran, and the chase on the runway look quite far-fetched).
The disadvantage of Argo is the distraction associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues are really very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are not the only ones in the film.
Affleck’s film lacks a bit of drama, it’s a film that can be watched with moderate interest, valuing the staging and retro-style recreating the thrillers of the seventies.
But it's hard to capture.
However, this is enough to remind of one, still in a certain sense of living history, as well as to testify to how exaggerated the idea of omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually conducts a survey on the most absurd banking fees, has now decided to announce a competition for “the most absurd regulation or project from the EU workshop”.
“We were motivated by this latest event, in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the administration of large European companies,” said Patrick Nager, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities already put forward for nomination is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to combine the rate of insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, women have had life insurance benefits because they are objectively less at risk for insurance companies.
“Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be submitted to the competition by the end of this year.
The vote itself will take place until the end of February 2013,” Nager said.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which as a result is harmful to nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively small amount of dangerous substances, or a directive on the size of the cage for chickens, as a result of which eggs have significantly risen in price this year.
Also criticized was the actual ban on the use of the term "butterfly oil" or the withdrawal from the sale of classic light bulbs.
High-quality bananas should be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European apparatus often makes decisions under the pressure of a trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually defended by a state or a group of states (thus the Czech Republic now even under the threat of a veto defends the demands of its banks).
The interests of the lobby are as follows: for example, bananas of the highest quality in the European Union had to reach a length of 14 cm and did not dare to show "abnormal curvature".
At the same time, the European Commission justified itself by only harmonizing existing fragmented national rules that complicated trade.
The EU, despite the resistance of some states, has still relaxed standards for fruit and vegetables, citing that existing directives will lead to food waste.
A candidate to win the poll could be last year's EU regulation, according to which the balloons sold must be equipped with a warning that children under the age of eight can not inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU has turned to American studies, according to which balloons when playing are a potential cause of death of children through suffocation.
Such a restriction now applies to children under 14 years old, who are prohibited from blowing in fair pipes.
Funny ideas are born at home.
The rule concerning the European officials themselves is also quite absurd: anyone who has any official position in the EU cannot, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, use the name of Macedonia, and should instead say “FYROM” (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The portal Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com in cooperation with the association of liberal economists "The principle of non-interference" (Laissez Faire), proposed for voting, in addition to several of the above absurd rules, for example, the EU rule on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a member state.
The EU has established the maximum amount of food reserves that can be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its accession to the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volumes of canned mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a large fine.
The organizers of the questionnaire were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for the fact that they do not have a sea, and the idea of providing subsidies for the application for subsidies.
But these ideas originated in Prague, not in Brussels.
“We are at a disadvantage because we do not have the sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation," said then-Minister of Agriculture Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Palas (CZSDP) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the country had a high grain harvest and, as a result of the so-called intervention procurement, the State had full stockpiles that needed to be taken out.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from the ports, the EU, according to the Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission met with the Czech Republic, organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from landlocked countries.
Subsidies for the subsidy were offered to the villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Nemts (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were to be used to draw up an application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Strange orders are an exception
Although regulations in member states are easily criticized, the EU’s efforts to regulate, as well as to improve the functioning and development of the EU, according to many experts, deserve rather recognition.
A serious problem, according to experts, is the drawing of EU subsidies for projects that do not even have a hint of something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which Member States have achieved during the discussion of the budget.
It evokes emotions among the Czechs and the fact that, as in other EU countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to a specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians, retained the name "Olomouc cheeses", however, "Tuzemsky rum", the traditions of which in our country go back to the 19th century, our producers had to change their name to "Tuzemak".
Rum can only be called products from cane distillate, and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products of the EU, along with the world-famous cheeses "feta" and "gorgondzol", marzipan from German L<0xC3><0xBC>beck or Parma ham, were, for example, Karlovy Vary crackers, Pogorzelice and Trebon carp and hops.
Also, the trademark of the EU can be proud of Pardubice gingerbread and Gorzhitsa tubes.
“People want me to protect the republic, but I’m an amateur,” Okamura said.
Mr. Senator, how does a person come to mind to run for president?
I'm not thinking of becoming a senator or president myself.
If everything in our country functioned without problems, I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch how the country has been plundering over the past 20 years, how thieves are busking here, people are raising taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to figure out how to change it.
And since I’m in my forties and I’m an independent with no party, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You were in the Senate, but you soon went to the presidential castle.
Do you turn your back on the people who elected you?
I have always said that I would fight for the presidential castle depending on the outcome of the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified that if I was elected a senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not a position, a position is a tool by which I can realize my views.
Therefore, I need the greatest influence and the broadest authority.
But the difficulty is not only that we, as a nation, grumble in our bar or at the TV, but are ready to trample on anyone who tries to change something.
To this is added the media, which denigrates a person, and which confuses freedom of speech with freedom of lies.
For example, I was told that I gave bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Jiri Paroubek.
Let’s move on to your views.
You began the struggle for the presidential castle with theses about the material and criminal liability of politicians and about reverse property declarations worth more than twenty million.
To do this, the law needs to be changed.
You don't have that kind of authority as president, and only the Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I, as a citizen, lobbied for excursions to become a free enterprise, this was promoted.
The problem is politics – when someone comes up with a good proposal on the left or right, they are deliberately obstructed, and this deters citizens.
As an independent, non-partisan person, I have much greater potential to get support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country and apply it without party laying on the shelves, without looking at the dogmas.
Do you consider yourself more of a leftist or rightist?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people refer to me more as a leftist.
It doesn’t matter if it’s a little to the left or a little to the right.
It is important for us to move forward.
It’s not that someone is on the right, but someone is on the left, I want to bring people together.
I will always support any good decision for society, whether it will be proposed by the HRCM or the GDP, and I will also be against a bad idea.
You get angry when someone says you’re a populist.
But do you not prove it by what you have said?
When you create a business plan for a firm, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
You can call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about are already functioning in the world, or they are being talked about by prominent experts.
But without the support of parliament, you will only have slogans.
And with this in politics you will not last long.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to realize criminal and material liability?
I have no other choice.
Only to convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to lure them to our side so that we achieve ours.
If I had been elected President, it would not have been a problem to organize a live television broadcast in which I would appeal to the chairmen of parliamentary parties to legitimize material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they will have to tell you why they don’t want it.
If there is a strong personality that voices abuse, then it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president - it was the merit of the pressure from the public.
I am an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies to defend my beliefs and views.
I am only a beginner in politics, and for my program I will try to get the support of the majority.
I try to promote things on my own; if that fails, in six years I will finish and return to the private sector.
It sounds in part as if Okamura is supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I’m not going to do anything alone, so I bypassed a number of famous people with an offer to run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Yanchur, he refused due to the large amount of work.
I also at least supported investigative journalist Yana Lorentsova, who uncovered the light fuel oil fraud.
I put forward my candidacy because people are really dissatisfied, but now I feel on the scales.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the polls, and the majority of those who went chose representatives of the establishment.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
The people have chosen the Senate in such a way that changes will be difficult to implement.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, for example, for direct elections of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking about starting your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet because I don’t have time to check the purity of each potential supporter’s past, and I don’t have the money for that.
There is no money for the presidential campaign, in my transparent account only twenty thousand crowns.
You don't have any money?
You are talking about property declarations, and how are your own affairs with this?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, a collection of works of art for about 10 million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and Skoda Superb for a million, well, several million more on the account.
By the way, Aston Martin appeared to me because it was my boyhood dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove a car, was gallant with women and at the same time fought against meanness and lawlessness.
You drive an Aston Martin, you own a $60 million fortune, and you don't have the money to campaign?
You say that you want to change the republic, but you do not want to invest your own money in this.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to get into debt?
I've already invested $2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have sponsors suggests that my program isn’t that interesting.
And I don't have to pay for a campaign out of pocket.
The cost of the campaign will essentially be covered by the senator's salary.
But I wouldn’t live on that money, for example, I couldn’t pay my son for an English school that costs $30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for office.
So you're going to continue to do business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd cut back?
But it does not depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activity.
For example, the managing director of the travel agency in the spring will be my deputy.
People would have wanted me to be the unmercenary who would keep the republic.
But I need to live on something, too.
As an entrepreneur, how much do you get paid each month?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I get further.
If I were president, I would have finished my business.
You will find the full interview in the Saturday edition of the Pravo newspaper.
MVRDV architects prove that real adventures happen not only in the imagination - on the example of Speikenisse and his newly built Book Mountain - 2 photos
“To me, this building seems fun, it looks futuristic, finally we can see something interesting again,” says Lisette Verheig, passing on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist at a nearby large enterprise, thinks, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself: why do we need another library today?
Everyone has an Internet, an iPad, and e-books.
No one wants to go to a library like this anymore, right?
Spekenisse, a small bedroom town near Rotterdam, holds an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this unfortunate circumstance, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to general education and build seven fictional bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes, in the form of picturesquely painted miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative has been modest.
And then the fathers of the city realized that they had the only way to overcome the statistics: to build a library here!
Vini Maas of Rotterdam’s MVRDV architectural bureau, a master of bold bar charts and author of witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, approached the task with his usual equanimity and appeared at a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the members of the jury looked around puzzled and shrugged, the bold Maas folded from his original gift a pyramid in size and ended the speech in defense of his project with the following words: "Dear citizens!"
Here it is, my proposal: "Book Mountain" in Speykeniss, the so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, this <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million mountain has grown.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential buildings and townhouses for a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, Book Mountain was awarded the second prize of the “Best Library of the Netherlands 2012” competition.
The project also participates in the national Dutch competition of wooden structures in 2012.
Thus, a faceless suburb that previously had nothing to offer but a postmodern pedestrian zone and a surprisingly ugly town hall, the white facades of which suggest the idea of a dairy, has become richer for one modern piece of architecture.
But most importantly - in Speykeniss appeared the first in the history of this town public building of cultural purpose.
The Long Road to a Book
First impression: book Eldorado under the cheese cap.
There is only one elevator in the center of the mountain range, because true fans of architecture and reading will prefer to explore this area on foot.
The glazed room on all sides is bright and easily visible, the floors of burnt brick and elegant street lights unmistakably create the feeling of a public city square.
The urban environment is recreated perfectly.
Involuntarily looking for benches, dogs and playing football boys and girls.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
“Usually, bookshelves stand along the facades, and in the middle there is a large dark hall, usually uncomfortable and faceless,” says Winnie Maas.
We put the classic configuration of the space on the head and pulled the reading area from the inside out.
The interior space of the book mountain is used skillfully: in the center there are offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an ecological center and technical premises.
Especially please black bookshelves, which serve as a wall decoration, then railings, then stair railings.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and construction engineers are lost in guesses, what kind of unknown material.
“We were committed to working with secondary materials,” explains Joppe Trauborst, project manager representing the Speikenisse community, as required by the standard.
And one day, at an agricultural enterprise in Friesland, we found a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, an artificial fibrous material of millimeter thickness is used as a substrate for the roots.
It is cheap and saves time.
Thin textiles serve one or two seasons, after which it can be thrown away.
For the library, this canvas - for the first time in such volumes - was pressed into a panel four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called landbauplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material, smelling a little like a new car and a little sneaker.
There are 105 steps to the top.
Whoever overcomes the path of almost 500 meters in length will be rewarded in a literary cafe not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and wood ficuses in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and first of all about the proper humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
The cost of a new soul
“It’s hard to believe, but this building, despite the many glass surfaces, is an exemplary project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
For its heating and cooling, the heat of the earth is used.
Although the Book Mountain stands under a glass cap, even on clear days the sun only gets inside for a short time.
Wide farms of glued wood, located perpendicular to the glass facade, give shade and take on most of the sun's rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is provided by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned IT skeptic, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verheig was already here.
Cynthia Bogard, a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine, called Bukenberg “the soul of Speikenisse, which has been missing for a long time.”
The reason: a few weeks before the opening, each resident received an invitation to donate one book from their own collection.
These books were supposed to take up empty spaces on the shelves of a not yet fully stocked library – at that time it had 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The regiments are forced to the top.
“There’s nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Vinnie Maas.
“I think thanks to our invitation now every resident is connected in some way to this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal problem, which in professional jargon is called identity creation.
Spiekenisse wrote his literary history.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
This is just the starting point for identity building.
Sabo: "The Germans must play a more important role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany first made clear that it would vote against the Palestinians’ application for observer status with the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained from the vote.
Why? Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Now Germany needs to be careful about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I do not believe that she supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the introduction of a no-fly zone.
In the end, NATO made the offer.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, moving from the policy, which, so to speak, was controlled by the United States, to the German foreign policy itself.
In addition, the situation is complicated by the fact that the Europeans do not have a coherent single policy.
Thus, the Germans again find themselves between two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that while they are only finding their role, they are on the way to a “more normal” foreign policy.
Such a foreign policy, which is carried out by France or Great Britain.
What exactly does “normal” foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
This is a willingness to take a position in their national interests that does not depend on the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, on exports and ties with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests differ greatly from those of other major states, and Germany must therefore defend its interests.
Did these economic interests influence the position in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful not to offend the public and the elites in Arab countries.
Either way, it plays a role.
But I wouldn’t put too much emphasis on that, it’s not a completely one-sided relationship.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Has Germany harmed its relations with the United States by refraining from making important decisions, such as voting on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe, and even in the United States, the understanding of the German position prevails.
So I don’t think it was as dramatic a fiasco as it was in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect in this way.
After all, this signals that she should be taken seriously as a player on the international arena and that her interests should be taken into account.
In Europe, there are differing views on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, strongly supported the veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the United States and many European countries?
Because of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration has a deep understanding of the European position.
But due to the local political situation, the government cannot openly take such a position.
I believe that significant differences of opinion are not as significant as they always seem.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policies.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and its position as an important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that’s what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a single, consistent European policy, but this is not the case now.
They are therefore unable to take a broader approach and are forced to act instead on their own view of the situation.
This is what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take the lead in developing a common European position.
It is clear that this is not easy for Germany, at least because of its ties with Israel.
This topic has always been sensitive.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they must play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it not really assume the leading role?
Or is the leading role still difficult to give to Germany?
Germany is not yet used to it, it is still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is always difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany takes on an important role, a variety of anti-German feelings are manifested.
The Germans don't just deal with it.
Actually, it’s an old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult situation than the United States.
It should take into account a variety of neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
So, the US influence in European politics is constantly weakening, but at the moment the EU is not filling this vacuum, who then remains?
The Germans will have to play a bigger role.
Even if you do not like it, it is unpleasant or increases the dislike for you - this is life!

‘Trademark protection’ in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, and Polo Ralph Lauren is one too.
What is Armani Polo?
This is a completely officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the firms from whose names it is formed.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names file a lawsuit.
But even then, it is unclear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
“Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing who specializes in trademark infringement in the Far East.
There's a new case like this on my desk every week.
It is enough for imitators to add only a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci you get Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German enterprises, for example, the manufacturer of sports goods Puma, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens a folder with the records of the Office of registration of trademarks in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma trademark there, an artificial name that also uses the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities, there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively fakes.
However, Pattloch's cases are not like that. On the instructions of his trustees, he opposes that Chinese enterprises should officially receive the right to use the name, which is already protected somewhere else, from the Office of Trademark Registration.
The Chinese call it "Ban Minpai," a passenger brand.
This word is associated with "ban daquan".
That's what they call women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese government does not admit guilt.
“This is damaging to business, and it needs to be addressed,” Pattloch said.
“The brand is blurred, the unique position is lost, the image suffers very much.”
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are estimated in the millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to market research firm CLSA, China, with sales of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion a year, is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods.
However, it is difficult to obtain the removal of questionable entries in the trademark register, and it is expensive.
The process can last up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court rejected the lawsuits, since after a long time the contested name became "the reality of the market".
If the plaintiff is not lucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarist, as he damaged his trademark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also famous cases about graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, a company that had recently acquired concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use an emblem similar to a Mercedes star.
The company that bought Volvo, Geely, initially used a blue and white logo that resembled BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
Fashion goods manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, where the famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese government is not to blame.
The CTMO trademark registration office in Beijing confirms that there were difficulties in 2010 due to the lack of staff and equipment of the premises.
But last year there was a “return from an emergency in the working process to the norm.”
Thus, the number of unprocessed objection cases decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 percent more than last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending in the department.
Fighting it is expensive.
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China has topped the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth time in a row.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan of fees were paid.
To simplify, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
It is worth many times more to protest it, as the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the concern has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans managed to ensure that the illegal production of fake car parts was eliminated.
However, the imitator secured the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
This was a personal omission, as surnames in Germany are not protected, says Hanno Ventzler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the CTMO trademark registration office rejected the Munichers’ claim.
True, Freudenberg won in both subsequent instances, but the opposite side continues to struggle to this day.
You need to be vigilant
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Ventzler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: “The process is extremely expensive and takes up a lot of our time, money and nerves.”
Internal costs are unlikely to be accounted for, the company's archive had to be reviewed even by acts a century ago to bring evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing party a “big six-figure sum in euros” for the settlement.
“It’s clear from this how much it costs us,” Ventzler says.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spread even to Europe.
Namely, if the imitators register unprotected trademarks there.
So, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather goods.
The concern has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this was able to prevent registration.
“You have to be careful,” Ventzler says.
Both he and Pattloch’s lawyer recommend that German businesses be very careful with China.
It’s not enough to rely on international trademark protection provisions, rather foreigners should “all that is worth protecting in some way, register also in China,” Ventzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the opposing party license fees for his own name, Ventzler explains.
Otherwise, we will be forced out of the market in the controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: to drown, to sing, to help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are happy about it.
The history of relationships that have covered a distance of more than 8,733 kilometers.
First of all, drowning is distributed: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's boats and men's slippers pick up the clock on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Only after that slowly grow the voices of the singers - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they advance, charm and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost jumps out of his fabric shoes as he guides them with flexible and expressive gestures.
On Monday evening, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
Fifty participants of the choir from 23 to 69 years old came to the rehearsal, from a specialist in human genetics to a janitor.
"Om"Obani" is a difficult thing, every voice of the choir has its own text, moreover, in a completely foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to Unaids, the United Nations AIDS programme, there are about 34 million HIV-infected people in the world.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland is home to 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 percent of the population is HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Essitjeni, Voices for Africa found bosses in Germany.
70 of them attend a school preparing for further education.
For <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 or <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 per month, you can take over the management.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms and a daily hot lunch at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi in Zulu language means storyteller or praiser.
In this hall, they do not speak fluently on the bantu, but they can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been learning songs in this foreign soft language and from time to time even brings them back to where they first appeared: to the south of Africa.
After all, at a distance of 8733 kilometers in the summer from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voices of the German choir.
Infected 40%
There live about 2000 people, some still in simple huts of clay and straw, among the inhabitants are many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died of the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni, the miniature reflects the disease of the whole of Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the foreskin in men, which has been proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, is almost not accepted among the population.
More than forty percent of the population of Swaziland carry the virus of immunodeficiency, death in the middle of the fourth decade is not uncommon.
The choir opened this village in a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before that, the participants of Imbogni saw a lot of children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothes, education.
Without schooling, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was the private obligation of individual participants - for a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him the opportunity to receive hot food once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the Voices for Africa association, which has since been almost professionally caring for AIDS orphans in Essitjeni.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Frequent viral STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
Pulmonary pediculosis and scabies belong to parasitic STIs.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are the result of sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydial infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea, and the human papilloma virus.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, chlamydial infections are significantly more common than among other population groups.
According to European data, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
We also often have a human papilloma virus among young people.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about one tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a venereal disease?
With infectious diseases, sores in the genital area, complaints when urinating, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen, as well as blisters or seals may occur.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and go unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not give one hundred percent protection.
In fact, in part, sexually transmitted infections can also spread through contact infection and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examination, especially with frequent change of sexual partners.
With early diagnosis, most STIs can be cured and long-term consequences avoided.
The chefs, donations and, last but not least, the fees for performances of the choir throughout Germany allow you to collect something.
“In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Essitjeni,” says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, the money from Germany is managed by Tsodva Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also makes sure that the orphans are well arranged, for example, one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as they call old women in Zulu, is the backbone of the village.
Some of them have taken in up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children in uniform appear every day on time at the lessons.
Those who do not have any relatives, go to the shelter to Hanisila, a single woman who receives a salary from the association, as well as two cooks who every day prepare for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, together with the American health organization PSI, organized an HIV test for many villagers.
It is difficult to imagine, but about the disease, which is so obvious throughout the country, prefer to be deeply silent.
The King and His 14 Wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it is related to sexuality.”
Quite unusual for a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a state-sanctioned lifestyle is also to blame for the fact that the IH virus has spread so quickly in past years.
But it also lies on the vagabond workers who carry the virus across the country.
There are free condoms literally on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, “but they’re hardly ever used.
Another culture is flesh to flesh.”
To support cultural exchange a little, Ibmogni’s choir makes a trip to southern Africa every two or three years and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-awareness that many on the southern edge of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in black language – such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even, it happened, caused tears in the eyes of severe border guards.
The trip always leads also to Essiteni, where the singers visit the children in charge.
Despite the fact that a small village can hardly be found on the map, in the valley of the Etsulveni river it is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is light," say the people here.
And after an 8733-kilometer flight back to Heidelberg, when the drowning singers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light burns here as well.
NASA is opening up ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet can be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has proved the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is located closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water there, according to three studies published Thursday in a special journal Science.
The Messenger probe found evidence that the constantly shadowed region of the planet is covered with ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 meters.
The water is thought to have come from a comet or possibly an asteroid that collided with Mercury.
No one has linked the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said Sean Solomon, the probe’s scientific director.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building blocks of life got to other places in the solar system.
Invisibly for the inhabitants of the Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots, such as the Phoenix, explore the depths of the Universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: small windows in endless distances.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the Sun for Neptune, Ceres, according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union from 2006, is not a "planet".
This fragment of the Spitzer infrared image represents a “family portrait” of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue dots, it is more difficult to identify in the stellar circle pink “newborn” stars.
This region of star formation — scientists call it W5 — was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This iridescent heat of a dying star was photographed by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
A doughnut-like ring is made up of material that the star ejected as it died.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this picture of a galactic maternity ward.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called the Seven Sisters, can be seen at night with the naked eye.
Of course, with a telescope, colors get better.
How the red eye winks at the observer the Snail Nebula in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
The similarity with the Earth's continent brought this nebula the nickname "North America".
The combination of normal and infrared photography provides expressive color reproduction.
This new star in all its beauty was photographed only with the help of infrared sensors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How they came to be is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
These may be fragments of the moon Saturn, which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and clearest images of the Hubble Space Telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color transfer, images of spiral galaxies turn into real works of art.
Published by the European Southern Observatory, the image shows the nebula Trifid in the constellation Sagittarius, a few thousand light years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-parted, three-parted), as the dark bands of dust divide into three parts the red-hot heart of the cradle of the stars.
In the constellation of Ophiuchus, astronomers have photographed the harbinger of a cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light years from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies are drifting towards each other and will inevitably collide.
This birth of the star was captured by the Hubble Space Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who does not like technical abbreviations can call it by the nickname "Southern Pipe Wheel".
A Hubble Space Telescope image shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula, 1,400 light-years away, is made up of dust particles that are 10 to 100 times smaller than ordinary household dust.
This image was made up of optical and X-ray images from various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was photographed for NASA by the Hubble Space Telescope.
The large spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this stellar nebula is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The star cradle is constantly creating new stars.
This stellar cloud, connected to the Rosette Nebula, is also constantly creating new stars — 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, only gas.
The researchers suggest that it originated shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our Views of the Universe: The Most Important Telescopes
It is likely that the telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgei – even before Galileo Galilei started observing the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become more and more - and the spaces available to their eyes are becoming deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror depicted here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the United States, installed the "Big Binocular Telescope".
It allows you to look into space with the help of two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
Gran Telescopio Canarias has a giant internal device - the diameter of the mirror alone is 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the “Big South African Telescope” in South Africa is segmented – in order to reduce the cost.
However, in diameter it reaches about eleven meters.
The lack of an inexpensive design: the telescope is rigidly fastened at a vertical angle - this limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its feature: high light collecting ability.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror - the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers are listening for extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by providing their computing power.
A view of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) Observatory in the Chilean Andes.
Here is a "Very large telescope" - fully consistent with its name.
Its four mirrors allow you to illuminate in the visual tube even the average infrared spectrum.
The European Very Large Telescope is also planned to be installed at ESO’s Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror should span as much as 42 meters – and will be made up of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, photos should be expected no earlier than 2018.
Until 2007, both Keck telescopes on Hawaii’s Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, along with them, also looks up at the sky with the help of the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope should appear on Mauna Kea - with a mirror with a diameter of thirty meters.
Here you can see them in the illustration.
However, the most important species from space is supplied by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been supplying paintings of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for planets outside the solar system, primarily planets that could host life.
On February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 candidate planets had been discovered since the mission began.
The photo shows the latest preparations of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space no earlier than 2018 aboard the Ariane 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for the Big Bang through the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists believe that there is ice at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data on this, since the Messenger rotates closer to the north pole of the planet.
Radar measurements for decades indicated that there was ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now confident of this.
Drink oil every day - and live to be 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach biblically venerable age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Searching for a solution in a country where 97-year-olds still seem relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach biblically venerable age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Searching for a solution in a country where 97-year-olds still seem relatively young.
A trip through the Talysh Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
The minibus with thunder rolls along the winding road past the hills overgrown with dense forests, stormy rivers and simple peasant houses.
Everything is so green and bright that you would think you were in the Black Forest.
But this is the southernmost edge of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is only a few kilometers away.
Talysh live here - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which little is known, except that they speak Farsi and Azerbaijani well and are distinguished by longevity.
The final point is Lerick.
The small town boasts too heavy architecture of Soviet times, which is not at all in harmony with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe almost do not come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tiring.
At 323 kilometers, it takes eight hours, since the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth to which the country owes the oil of the Caspian Sea, here, in the province, has not yet reached.
However, Pilate Fatulaeva (48) is convinced that there is something in Lerik to interest tourists.
"In May, Baku became famous for the Eurovision Song Contest - and next year we will host the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulaeva says.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the biography of about eight dozen tallyshes from these places, who are more than 100 years old. Fatulaeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he had another child.
But the controversial star of the museum is the chaban Shirali Muslumov, who allegedly turned 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And taking into account the fact that the oldest person, whose age is confirmed by documents, is 122 years old, the age of Muslyumov seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in the area in 1805, died in 1973," Fatulaeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he allegedly had a daughter.
So did the muslim shepherd add a couple of decades to his age?
Even Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of centenarians in Central Asia.
“Astoundingly many elderly people can also be found in some parts of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholz, “there are also extremely many very old people living in Sardinia.”
However, due to the lack of documents, scientific confirmation of age is impossible, since there were no registers of civil status.
A glass of hot oil every day
Nevertheless, there is a fact that people in the Lerica area are strikingly often reaching the biblical age.
There are now 20 people over 100 years old living here.
Why are there so many centenarians here in the south?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzade explains this by the special genes of Talish.
The director of the Fatulaeva Museum, on the contrary, believes that it is about nutrition.
Talysh love meat, bread and most of all dairy products, many of them drink a glass of melted oil every day. However, it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet can be healthy from a dietary point of view.
Or is it a primitive way of life that keeps people young? In Chenghemwana, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzoeva.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasian region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of oil, which she rolls back and forth untiringly.
Here, eight people live under one roof, including one of the sons and daughter Mirzaeva, who have long had their grandchildren.
There are also two kids nearby.
In the kitchen, guests are served tea, which is served in typical bubbly glasses of armoud.
Mirzaeva has perfectly smooth and strong white teeth, she hides long dark-red braids under her head scarf, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always wash my hair with milk, so they never fall out and keep the color.
“And I’ve never used shampoo,” Mirzaeva says.
A monthly pension is enough for life
She always ate only what grew in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
In my entire life, I have never bought food in a store.
Then she talks about her husband, who served in the army.
The worst was after the Second World War.
But it got better when Heydar Aliyev’s “favorite father” stood at the helm.
Propaganda is not often heard in the speech of an old woman.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, knows practically no borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then the reins of government took his son Ilham.
However, there is no poverty among the Azerbaijani elderly.
Mirzayev receives 230 manats (about the same amount of euros) monthly as a pension, for local conditions this is an amount for which you can live well.
And, perhaps, Mirzaeva’s long-grown son is also right: “Old people in our culture are deeply respected.”
They live in a large family, loved, surrounded by care and happy.
There is no reason to stay alive as long as possible.
The word “human right” is missing from the constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo show a deep split in the country.
A future constitution based on sharia was met with fierce resistance.
The Egyptian president did not skimp on pathos.
We need to create a transition.
“And his success lies in my responsibility to the people and to God,” he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but first of all to the Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and non-religious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, still hopelessly divided in the confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi, almost apologizing, said he had temporarily curtailed the jurisdiction of the constitutional court and expanded his jurisdiction “to save the revolution.”
However, what the 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, is not quite clear to the Egyptians and the whole world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of power?
In fact, 234 articles were dragged through a night-time 15-hour hurdle jump at an Islamist-leaning 100-member constitutional assembly, and this is partly cause for concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft says the judicial process is based on “principles of Islamic law”.
But what do you mean by "principles"?
This has been and remains a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that Islamists will use the vague wording and the resulting legal backlash to interpret Sharia more strictly.
At least, this is hinted at by one new article: in all matters relating to Sharia, the University of Al-Ashar, the country’s most important Islamist institution, which enjoys great authority in all Sunni Islam, should be brought to the council.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy are supervising the legislation, which would de facto result in a restriction of the judicial power.
In the draft constitution, much is subject to interpretation.
Another problem was that the military court should retain the jurisdiction of civilians.
These courts during Mubarak’s rule served to suppress the opposition.
After the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were held in military custody.
Also, as stated in the draft, the state should protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "support its morality and values."
Legally, this is so vague that government agencies will be able to control even the content of film and literature with the help of this article.
Open text means nothing more than censorship.
In general, no article directly establishes equality between men and women.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his Messengers.
But what the offense is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
The wording that “insulting people” is prohibited is also questionable.
Will there be enough caricatures of the president or jokes about the lawyer?
The issue of interpretation, as well as much in this draft, which Morsi proposes to sign and which, according to him, “very soon” will be submitted to the Egyptians for a referendum.
“The Revolution is Back”
For several weeks now, opposition has been forming against the superiority of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unanimity on Friday evening in Cairo’s Tahrir Square and vowed to destroy the document before it could come into force.
“The revolution is back and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who finished third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei said the draft constitution belongs “in the dustbin of history.”
Through Twitter’s short news service, he accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to lead a “putsch against democracy.”
“If he calls a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,” Yasser Saeed said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet avenged,” Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khaled Ali as saying.
Many judges also said they did not want to observe the referendum, which would have made it invalid.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for the opposite demonstration, but, as a precaution, not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women under veils and Salafi adherents who shouted: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded from Morsi: "Clean up the country!" and assured: "The Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic square on which it all began provoked a state of almost civil war.
Morsi’s followers clearly did not want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had spoken out loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box in which direction the country should go.
The majority for the Islamist project, it is considered a solved case.
“The concept of ‘human rights’ is never mentioned.”
Hafiz Abu Saeed is enraged by this forced constitutional process, which, in fact, was to last until February with the participation of all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were imprisoned or brought to justice under Mubarak.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words “human rights” are never found in the new constitution, he regrets in an interview with “Welt am Sonntag”.
The expansion of Morsi’s influence over all three branches of power in the state disappoints the lawyer.
These measures represent a clear blow to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening the civilian state, the president de facto annulled it,” said Saeda.
Without civil society, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of the directions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
There may be a reckoning for that.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: “You’re creating a monster you can’t control.”
Norwegian rakfisk: the worst smelling fish in the world?
Norway’s population of five million has one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe, but worldwide.
Perhaps the secret of the success of this country is somehow connected with the local addiction to one extremely catchy fish dish?
Take a few overripe pieces of cheese.
Put them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You will get a bouncy smell of raspberries - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, a three-hour drive from Oslo.
Around snow-covered picturesque views. It is very beautiful, but in the air spills an indestructible characteristic smell.
Rakfisk is a trout, sprinkled with salt and fermenting in water for up to a year, depending on what kind of soul you need to achieve.
As the twilight condenses and cools, crowds of Norwegians gather for a festival in Fagernes dedicated to this very, shall we say, exciting dish.
"She is eaten raw and washed down with a glass of aquavit, the local dark vodka," explains Haward Halvarsen, a local firefighter by profession and part-time "rakfiskov general" who runs the festival.
All around us, people eat fish cut into small cubes and drink it in large portions of alcohol.
“Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk,” says Haward.
This drink is able to break the smell.
I'm trying a couple of pieces.
If you manage to carry a piece under your nose, then everything is not so bad - not much different from the portion of sushi that you took with you on the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from completely different times, times of poverty, when, even before the appearance of refrigerators, fish in the fall were soaked in hermetically sealed barrels with salt water.
Then in the deep winter, when the fish has already well and thoroughly fermented, it was extracted and, having muffled the perception of alcohol, eaten.
The last generation remembers the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate, mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, who are attracted by jobs, high salaries and a developed social security system.
Residents of Sweden (an old rival, and not so long ago and a much more prosperous neighbor) massively come here to work.
Rakfisk is perceived as an important symbol, an indispensable, albeit somewhat ominous, element of Norway’s past.
It is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you <0xC2><0xA3>9 ($14).
Norway rarely appears in the world’s news, and most of the country’s residents seem to be comfortable with that.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, a racist and right-wing extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the terrorist attack is called “the incident of July 22.”
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and murders.
At the heart of Norway’s prosperity today is the growth (since the early 1970s) of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
“Oil, however, is not the only reason for our prosperity,” says Anna, our rakfiska tray-handler, a woman with long blond hair and strikingly blue eyes, the epitome of Nordic well-being.
We are a people, as you call it, reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she is fluent in English.
We don't like to show off, we're not boastful.
Norway is very careful with its oil – most of the revenues of the oil and gas industry are invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone was squandering money they didn’t have, Norway was conservatively calculating all costs.
“As long as you can ski in the winter and go hiking in the summer, that’s enough for happiness,” says Anna.
"And there is a raffle," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for some food - I've had enough raffis.
Here's a hamburger with salmon meat - it's certainly exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening we are waiting for even more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
In my hotel there is a special dinner dedicated to the rakfisk, during which visitors vote to determine the best or, perhaps, the most fragrant fish.
There is a live TV show, which shows the presenter in a bow tie, surrounded by plates with raffis.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"So, Thor-J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen, what do you rate the best fish out there in the mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our estimate."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone falls from a chair, perhaps taking over the aquavit.
Or maybe it was just the smell of fish.
Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto will have a difficult start to his career.
As Mexico’s newly elected President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to take a look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his country’s population.
Traffic in Mexico City is in a particularly bad state.
This city is overloaded with transport and at the best of times, and since Monday, steel barriers have been erected, cutting several key highways to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was not done to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from getting to the parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, will wear a presidential vest and take the reins of the country.
He faces a difficult task.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, who is now out of office, but the country is mired in a war on drugs that has claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
“My government declares to the people of Mexico its readiness to fight violence,” Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the White House’s Oval Office earlier this week.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Prior to such statements, Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto’s political career, alongside the President of the United States, had developed as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In his homeland, in the densely populated and vast state surrounding the country's capital, opinions about the new leader are divided.
Straight-lined man
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, he is remembered with warmth.
Residents credit it with the revival of tourism, the development of the resort area and the creation of infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new highways built by Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, which are strikingly different from the roads with potholes and pits that were previously on this site.
The plaques with his name hang on the modern building of the sports center and on the impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We have hopes for real and serious change with him,” says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state congressman from the Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto-led Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that our country so urgently needs, especially in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years in power, the PRI party was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence from the Los Pinos presidential palace, the party has high hopes for Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
In addition, he refutes the accusations of lack of contention made by the opposition to the new president.
He is very forthright and very committed to the realization of his vision of the future of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, a man who knows how to listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, is the most striking contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under the overpasses of highways, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also of a severe nature of this metropolis.
Troops had been deployed earlier this year to quell drug trafficking gangs in those areas; violence against women was particularly acute.
In the last two years alone, dozens of bodies of murdered women have been found in a wasteland near a vast landfill.
More than a thousand women were killed in Mexico State during Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto's governorate, far exceeding the figure in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juárez, which has become a household name when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto ' s opponents, he could at best be said to have been unable to cope with the problem of killing women during his tenure as governor.
In the worst case, his administration is accused of completely ignoring this problem.
A resident of a concrete house similar to most homes in this dilapidated area, Irineja Buend<0xC3><0xAD>a has a hard time holding back tears by showing me photos of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was killed by her roommate.
“When I got to her house, it looked like her body had been washed before,” Ms. Buendia recalls.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and her body was already numb.
Mariana’s mother retells this story, and the portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where he hangs next to the crucifix, on which there is only one word: justice.
That, they said, was what the family was denied.
“State officials treated me like an old gossip, a disgruntled troublemaker.
They want people to just accept everything they say and keep quiet.
But this is wrong, it cannot be done, especially when there are so many violations and shortcomings around,” she says.
Wearing the presidential garb on Saturday, President Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, along with her, will take on a difficult responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crimes, and the new president has promised to make addressing the issue a priority during his tenure.
“I hope he will be exactly the same president as he was governor,” says Olvera, a congressman from Valle de Bravo of the PRI party.
However, this is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, the prosecution says.
Prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning's claims of poor conditions of detention.
The hearing focused on Manning's stay in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense demands that the case be closed on the grounds that Manning's conditions of detention were cruel.
The U.S. military has been accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified materials in U.S. history, did not take advantage of the many opportunities to file a complaint about the ill-treatment, which, according to him, he had to endure while in military prison.
During a cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort Meade, Maryland, the military prosecutor, Major Ashden Fein, said records of Manning's weekly visits by prison officials for nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia, contained no complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination of Manning's motion to dismiss, on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were cruel and sufficient punishment in themselves, took place the day after Manning had stated that, while in custody, he had intended to commit suicide.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing several thousand classified documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet on the website of WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks did not confirm that Manning was the source of the information.
During Friday’s hearing, Prosecutor Fein, along with Manning, reviewed reports that were filed after Manning’s visits by administration officials during his time in Quantico prison, where he was held under a strict detention regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When prosecutor Fein asked about the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he viewed the prison administration's treatment as "excellent" and the general conditions of detention as "very professionally organized."
The reports reviewed do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite Manning being asked directly about the conditions of his detention, Fein said.
Manning replied that he was verbally concerned about these problems and that the administration officials who visited him had discussed the problems with him and stated that they would deal with them, but had not recorded them in writing.
“They recorded ‘no problems’ (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn’t mean I didn’t bring it up in the conversation,” Manning says.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained about his ill-treatment in January 2011 during a hearing of a commission examining suicidal intentions he had expressed in writing months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting he had wanted to have the “injury prevention” regime removed from him and the conditions of detention relaxed.
Military officials explained that the restricted detention regime — a level lower than the suicide-prevention surveillance regime — was introduced to protect the prisoner, as well as the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I'm okay, so they can cancel the injury prevention regime ... so that my standard of living improves, from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to a prison at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had thoughts of suicide in Kuwait and that he had once lost consciousness due to the intense heat.
He explained that it is psychologically very difficult when you are not given to know how your fate is decided, and what is happening in the outside world.
“My world has shrunk to Camp Arifjan, the size of my prison,” Manning said on Thursday.
“I thought I was going to die in this cage.”
While in Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small cell — at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours a day — alone.
Manning says he was only allowed to leave a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, some clothing and glasses.
He says he tried to move because sleeping or even just lying in the daytime was forbidden by the rules.
According to Manning, during sleep, he was constantly struck by the light that penetrated the outside of the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he rolled over in bed at night, he said he was woken up and forced to turn on his back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal objection to Manning's misconduct in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, a judge questioned Manning about a statement he made while testifying on Thursday that after being forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico one night, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates at a morning checkup.
Manning said he was unable to cover himself with a blanket during the inspection.
Responding to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard's order that he should throw away a blanket he could cover himself with, but admitted that no one directly ordered him to throw it.
Manning said on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said he told the officer that he could have used a rubber band of shorts or flip-flops to injure himself, but did not.
That night, according to Manning, his underwear, flip-flops and glasses were taken from the cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account what he had to go through during his detention, and will significantly reduce his sentence if Manning is found guilty by a military court, which is due to begin hearing his case early next year.
The defense said it plans to offer Manning to plead guilty to less serious crimes and to contest the other charges as excessive.
The resumption of the hearings is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims Manning was held in Quantico under rules governing the detention of detainees with the strictest possible regime.
The charges against Manning include aiding and abetting the enemy, illegally facilitating the publication of data on the Internet, transmitting information related to national defense, and the theft of state property or documents.
If convicted on all counts in the indictment, he could face life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of a Mexican-American.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind the people of the country of difficult times.
Ruben Navarrette believes that Mexicans of American origin are torn between the two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked down the arrivals corridor, approached the border control zone, and froze on the spot.
The signs indicated two queues: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I've been called a Mexican all my life.
It’s just a casual name, like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish and my friends in New York call themselves Italian.
Later, I focused on the complex design of the “American of Mexican origin”.
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather’s homeland, there was no need for conventional names or complex constructions.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask or answer questions.
But my vocabulary is poorer than that of native speakers, and I can’t get rid of the American accent.
So I got my American passport and lined up for Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The agenda included the usual issues for the meetings of the presidents of these countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto was willing to talk about the rise of the Mexican economy, thanks to which Mexicans will now be able to stay in Mexico with the same success, instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no specific proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and old grievance.
Most Americans never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and at gunpoint forced its leaders to give up half of their territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in everything.
Therefore, it is only necessary for any U.S. statesman to say a word of criticism towards Mexico, in the press and among the elite of Mexican society there are complaints that Americans are encroaching on the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the descendants of Montezuma are full of militancy.
Mexico’s relationship with more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States is the most complicated.
Want to talk about insults?
That's enough.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities in this country, and those for whom there are no such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio, there are so many people of Mexican descent for only one reason: at some point in their family history, someone—father or grandfather—had no opportunity to realize themselves in Mexico and was forced to go north.
Most often they were Mexicans of a certain type - dark, poorly educated, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember that.
Mexico sees it differently.
Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we studied in good schools and got good jobs, but we do not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confusing and unclear, but we know which country to consider as our own.
United States of America.
Besides, we know that the majority of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not like us.
We respond to them in the same way.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class people, as not real Mexicans.
We don’t speak Spanish well enough, and our ties to Mexico aren’t strong enough.
Our very existence for them is explained by failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.
We would not be behind the silk curtain now, finding a full life in the United States, but losing spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the U.S. as a child, and this reminds me that there are certain tensions between real Mexicans and Mexican-Americans — Mexicans understand their national identity more clearly, and Mexican-Americans are offended.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my acquaintances of Mexican origin do not feel that they belong to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springsteen.
When you get the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
In Mexico, we are Americans.
In the United States, we are called Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relations were not sufficiently complicated, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to serve as sort of ambassadors for Mexico and represent its interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how great it is to visit it, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
It's not gonna work.
Too many insults in the past.
And given the gap between rich and poor, rampant corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not consider this country so beautiful.
I'm sorry, but deal with it yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still can’t forgive the United States for what they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful of how their relatives were treated in Mexico recently.
Yeah, right.
I think we have more in common than I thought.
Old battles in the new Middle East
Ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be fragile foundation for further peace
Is a long-term peace possible between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion that such hopes are futile.
It sounds like the usual, pointless debate about who started first; many buildings have been turned into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; for the first time in the conflict, rockets fired from Gaza fell in the vicinity of the Israeli capital Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, while Israelis and Palestinians are hopelessly stuck in their perennial conflict, the Middle East has changed.
This can be treated in different ways, but the events of the “Arab Spring” have swirled in a rebellious storm many established realities, and the Palestinians with the Israelis have not managed to stay away from the vortex that shook the region.
Perhaps, as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to hope for a way out of this deadly impasse.
A War Without Winners
At first glance, the current situation does not give reason for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on November 21, is implemented, the clashes this week have only strengthened the positions of security forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist Hamas movement, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will say that they forced Israel to retreat despite the losses they suffered.
Despite the fact that some leaders of the group were destroyed and 1.7 million residents blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is increasing its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time works for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world grows, Hamas has new powerful and wealthy friends.
The resurgent regional leader, Turkey, once Israel’s closest ally among Muslim countries, has come out in support of Hamas, followed by Qatar, one of the Gulf’s richest and fastest-growing states.
Hamas’s triumphant supporters claim to have created an Islamist crescent around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, ruled by the militant group Hezbollah, to Syria, in which increasingly pro-Islamist rebels are about to overthrow Bashar al-Assad, and further to Jordan, where the king’s power is threatened by Hamas allies.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, Egypt, where under President Mohamed Morsi the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood was strengthened.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was ousted in 2011, was a secular dictator who paid little attention to supporting Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, by contrast, is an organization largely similar to Hamas, and its leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic arrangements, Hamas could become a significant player whose voice cannot be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the “hard” line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.
In the military sense, Hamas was defeated.
Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile system justified the cost of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the Hamas-launched missiles.
Israeli citizens can sleep soundly, at least for a while.
As far as diplomacy is concerned, the United States has remained true to its position; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the latest round of violence.
Another important factor is Israel's economic prosperity, especially under the Binyamin Netanyahu government, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that approximately 30 Israelis have been killed by rockets fired from Gaza since 2004, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part through a wall that enters the West Bank – a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian state – and protects Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions under international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party – in preparation for the January 22nd elections – has teamed up with even more aggressive conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, is very convenient.
What's the point of pandering to the Palestinians and giving them a state of their own?
If they were to hand over all power in the West Bank, would they not launch rockets towards Israel from there, as their Gaza brothers do?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and rigidly suppress any attempts to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will win; however, their calculations can be refuted by the Arab Spring.
While Islamists, who come to power in Egypt and elsewhere, do not have the warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be domestic problems.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than all of its Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab governments strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of Egyptian President Morsi, who worked with Barack Obama on the cease-fire, is a good sign and could mark the beginning of change.
Israel must also take into account the long-term consequences of its policies.
As democratic changes in the Arab countries take place, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination is a time bomb that will sooner or later explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repressions are already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect – the growth of the Arab population – only exacerbates these problems.
The bloody operations that are carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the movement of Hamas are being paid for by the growing discontent of the international community.
Both sides need external momentum.
There remains the only solution to which sensible representatives on both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper, are relentlessly calling for: a two-state solution and Israeli cession of territories in exchange for security.
There remains hope, not too impressive in the short term, that a ceasefire will allow other countries to influence the parties to the conflict more effectively.
Egypt, which has long since made the decision to cut off arms supplies to the Gaza Strip, and Turkey and Qatar are in a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state that have been adopted since 1967, given the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fatah movements.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than the upcoming vote at the UN, which could result in recognition of Palestine’s virtual statehood.
President Obama has a role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never submitted his own peace plan.
After returning to the White House, he still shows reluctance to engage with the problem.
This is a catastrophically short-sighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the law on uniform packaging for cigarettes entered into force.
Warnings about the dangers of smoking and images of diseased parts of the body contrastingly stand out on the dull green boxes, the same for all brands of cigarettes.
The first-ever Australian law on the same-type packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing the logos and color design of different brands with the same box of dull olive color with creepy pictures of disease-stricken parts of the body and images of children whose health is undermined by smoking of their parents.
In addition to the various pictures and inscriptions warning of the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the packs introduced is mandatory from this Saturday - the names of brands that are printed in the same small print.
These are the most severe conditions in the world for the registration of packages of tobacco products.
The Australian federal government says the aim of the measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving them of this bad habit of fashionable status.
This decision was based on the results of studies that showed that people who did not start smoking before the age of 26, in 99 cases out of 100 never become smokers.
"It is obvious that even at a very young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to convey through the design of packaging," explains Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, referring to studies that have shown that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated in children with the idea of a princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest proportion of smokers in the world, so these changes will not affect the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering such measures.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the share of the black market, which will sell cheap and affordable cigarettes.
“This law will have serious consequences different from those conceived by its initiators,” said Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for British American Tobacco in Australia.
Counterfeit manufacturers from China and Indonesia will supply many more of these goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the contrary, new laws contribute to the growth of business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, claims that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone cases hiding unpleasant pictures on the packaging has grown rapidly (almost from scratch) since two months ago companies such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case to Australia in a high court.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold about six thousand products to wholesalers and expects a new batch.
This is good business for us.
A potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among exactly the part of the population to which these measures are directed.
After the adoption in Australia of a number of laws that made illegal television advertising of cigarettes and their support for sports events, as well as prohibiting sellers to display cigarettes in a prominent place, advertising of tobacco products has moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local companies and websites from placing ads on the network, but it cannot restrict overseas sites.
“If you’re a tobacco trader and you only have this small loophole left, the idea of promoting your product online would be extremely tempting,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of brand reviews written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises - is it really the work of an ordinary citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he did not spare his efforts and time and made a video, or is an advertising company behind it?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco claims that the industry is now more busy adapting to the new rules than advertising.
The tobacco industry has even taken measures such as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these States are making claims within the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade has been unfairly restricted, despite the fact that the trade relations of all these countries with Australia are very small.
A WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya Plibersek, the government discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar laws on packaging.
In 2001, Canada was the first country to make it mandatory to post smoking warning photos.
Now this rule is adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia demonstrably do not obey the innovations.
These pictures don't bother me.
I just don't pay attention.
“You just grab a cigarette and put the pack in your pocket,” explains Victor El Haig, who buys cigarettes with a picture of a mouth tumor on the pack.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me quit is my little daughter.
James Yu, head of the King of the Pack tobacco store in central Sydney, says the same packaging has made it more difficult to stack the products on shelves.
“It used to take me an hour to unload a new batch, and now it takes me four hours,” he complains.
“The government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, we would then say: what to do, all right, it’s over, we’re closing the store,” he says, raising his hands up.
Boring in the world of electronic networks and constant connections is not so bad.
On this Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport, because our plane had mechanical problems and was replaced by another plane, which we were waiting for.
So I had plenty of time to think about the nature of boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and neither books, nor magazines, nor iPhone, nor even duty-free shops will help much.
However, in recent years, more and more scientists and specialists in child development are in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations it is not so bad for us and for our children to be bored.
This causes the brain to be distracted by interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in the modern world we are all constantly in front of some screen, the benefits of boredom pass us by.
Perhaps we should strive for boredom?
Yes, sir.
And at the same time, no.
We'll get back to that.
Previously, I, like many, believed that boredom is an invention of relatively recent times, when people had more free time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.
“In fact, boredom can boast a very ancient history,” he says.
On the walls in Pompeii found Latin inscriptions about boredom, dating back to the first century.
This leaves open the question of how we understand boredom.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of boredom has often changed.
After studying research on this topic and asking a question to a target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people "want to, but can not do what would bring them satisfaction."
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person doesn’t do something they’d like to do.
I don’t want to do anything with apathy.
The main thing in experiencing boredom, he says, is “the disturbance of attention and the associated deterioration of mood and the feeling that time is dragging on slowly.”
According to the description of boredom, it may seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible connection between these conditions, bored people see the causes of problems in the surrounding world and circumstances, and people experiencing depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re bored when it’s really just hard to focus on something.
In their study, “Unemployed Mind: Defining Boredom in terms of Attention,” published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues refer to a previously conducted experiment in which participants listened to a recording of a voice reading a journal.
Some participants also heard the loud sounds of an off-the-shelf television program included in the next room, others heard the same sounds at low volume so that they could barely be disassembled, and the third group listened only to voice recording without an extraneous soundtrack.
Those participants who heard the TV at a low volume level noted that they were bored, more often than others - they found it difficult to concentrate, but they did not know the reason for this and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, the interruption of attention can be boring, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neurology at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, “for example, peering into the flow of products on a conveyor belt in search of marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom.”
It is believed that when people start swinging on a chair or drawing doodles on a piece of paper, they do it from boredom, but now we know that in fact such actions simply help not to relax physically.
"The study showed that children who are not forbidden to erase and turn around learn better and remember more information than children who are required to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
At some point, we all get bored: with a flight delay (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an uninteresting movie.
However, different people show varying degrees of boredom.
In the 1980s, to measure such individual characteristics, the researchers developed a special “boredom scale”.
Questions and statements such as "A lot of what I have to do is monotonous and monotonous" or "I'm too interested, so there's not enough time for anything" are used to determine the score on such a scale.
Using such questionnaires, the researchers determined that boys are more likely to miss girls, says Steven Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially in the presence of a variety of external stimuli.
However, in general, adolescents in general are often bored.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted with the help of a pager almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.
The results were as follows: 32% of teenagers said they were bored at school and while doing homework, and 23% said they were bored outside of school.
Only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what such data on boredom would be like now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “adolescence has a peak of boredom,” mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully decide what to do.
Back to my original question: Is boredom useful?
Sometimes it doesn’t, because in extreme cases, research shows it can push people into absurd and dangerous physical activities, risky gambling, or substance abuse in an attempt to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have thought about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovic, who has devoted more than two decades to the study of this problem.
“So our brains tell us to do something else; it’s boring,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
However, this very brain does not always know what to do better.
If you get bored and you direct that energy to playing guitar or cooking experiences, you’ll make yourself better.
However, if you start watching TV, you will only get better for a while, and soon it will pass.
Therefore, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he will stop being bored, but he will not learn to deal with boredom on his own or in any other way to manage his time and work, - says Professor Fenske.
“Such self-regulatory skills are used in a variety of situations,” he says.
Your child learns not only to occupy himself with something, he also learns self-control in general.
I don't think boredom should be celebrated.
However, to consider it something bad is also not worth it.
Rather, you should learn to feel comfortable even outside of the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees with that.
“We see it in the way that we need to be bored more often, even though boredom is an extremely unpleasant, insatiable desire to do something meaningful,” he says.
In fact, people tend to somehow disconnect from constant worries and just relax.
“In the modern world, we are used to constant over-stimulation of the senses,” he says, “and when silence comes, we get lost and don’t know what to do.”
It is not yet clear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado will be applied
Anthony Orosco, a 19-year-old football team player and a public college student in southeastern Colorado, is charged with a criminal offense that will soon be perfectly legal across the state: possession of a small portion of marijuana and the tube in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosco says that he and friends were in Lamar one September and were driving in a car on the prairie near the Kansas border when they were stopped by police.
After a police officer discovered marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was subpoenaed for possession of drugs and possession of a drug-using device — minor offenses for which a fine of $100 is due — and a court date was set.
“We are being treated like criminals,” Mr. Orosco says.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that continues for weeks after the state of Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small amounts for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small court cases depends not so much on the law, but on the place of consideration.
Charges of minor marijuana offenses are already being dropped in hundreds of cases here and in the state of Washington, which has taken similar action.
Police stations have already stopped bringing charges against people aged 21 and older for possession of small doses, which will be considered legal once the law takes effect in a couple of weeks.
However, in the more conservative counties of Colorado, prosecutors have decided to look into existing marijuana cases and continue to prosecute possession of the drug.
At the same time, in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous areas of the West, they vote to prevent the emergence of new, state-licensed marijuana stores in their places.
“It’s going so fast that I don’t even know what to expect next,” said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Representatives of the regulatory authorities in the state of Washington are also puzzled by scratching their heads.
They have to form rules to determine the procedure for licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this must be done before December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado, for better or for worse, is ahead of most other states in regulating marijuana use, first for medical purposes and now for entertainment.
“Colorado has a more orderly market, so they’re going to set a good example,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Alcohol Regulatory Board in Washington state.
But now no one can do more, admits Mr. Smith, than to put forward some proposals and hope that it will work.
“We don’t have a real precedent that we could be guided by,” he says.
The Washington state bill, called I-502, will go into effect on December 6 and will put the state into a state of uncertainty for a year, when the state licensing system does not yet exist, and the right to own marijuana has already been legalized.
And there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be addressed in this period, for example, how to find a balance between the state's order on "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with a ban on its trade at a distance of 1000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
“It will be particularly difficult to locate licensed marijuana businesses in cities, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the newly formed marijuana legalization center research group.
On November 21, Aurora Police Chief Oates emailed his subordinates that the city's attorney's office would no longer hold anyone under the age of 21 accountable for possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that the police would stop incriminating people in these violations "from now on."
Police Chief Oates said police would monitor compliance with the city’s rules governing medical marijuana growers and prosecute illegal drug traffickers and distributors.
The Weld County District Attorney in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, presents a more rigorous approach to the matter.
After the vote on the bill, he said the prosecutor's office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession, mainly to encourage marijuana users to undergo treatment.
At the moment, 119 people are charged with possession of two or fewer ounces of marijuana, although many of them are accused of other violations.
“It is the duty of our institution to prosecute for acts that are considered criminal at the time of their commission,” Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was mixed even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.
The police of Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, no longer prosecute adults for possession of a small amount of the drug.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to drop the charges in the already open cases related to the possession of marijuana.
“I believe it is our direct responsibility to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
Despite the fact that 55% of Colorado residents who took part in the vote supported this decision, the inclusion of the use of marijuana for entertainment in the state and legal system will not be easy.
And the controversial reaction of residents in different parts of the state exposed the ambiguity of the attitude of local authorities to the state's experiment with marijuana.
“There’s a cultural barrier for district attorneys on this issue,” said Sean McAllister, a Denver-based attorney representing marijuana offenders and a local representative for the National Marijuana Reform Organization.
“They’ve been harassing people for so long that now they can’t really accept that it’s not a crime anymore,” he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first states to treat a small amount of marijuana the same as alcohol, are destined to become an experimental field nationwide to test the very idea of drug legalization.
Proponents of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they are cautiously waiting for instructions from the federal authorities, who still plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime.
Supporters of marijuana legalization hope that the Justice Department will give in to this issue.
Despite several high-profile arrests of drug dealers and patients for medical reasons, the federal government has largely given the go-ahead for the medical marijuana trade in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
DEA agents are unlikely to break into homes to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to turn a blind eye to state-regulated recreational marijuana stores that are allowed under the new law, according to Kevin A. Sabeth, a former anti-drug adviser in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal authorities.
Even before the presidential election, some local administrations approved a moratorium on the opening of new marijuana stores, which could not have opened earlier than a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, put forward a six-month ban on the marijuana trade, which is likely to be approved next week.
“We don’t want to be in a position where we’re going to give someone a license, and then it’s going to cause serious problems at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
The city voted against the amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still a lot of unresolved issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I survived Oxford for being a conservative.
Persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
For as long as I can remember, I have always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied at Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, a modern analogue of the ancient symposium, laying the two foundations of civilization - freethinking and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of studying at the history department of Oxford University’s Worcester College in the late 1980s, I packed my bags and left, which resulted in the first real scandal in my life.
My father couldn’t stand it and cried.
Friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I dropped out of college because I didn’t like my classmates having sex in the next room.
The writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from the rattled cups.
It wasn't really that much fun.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran away because I was being systematically harassed and intimidated.
Not at all because of my rather unusual name or the fact that I studied in a private school.
I was poisoned for only one reason, and in this illustrious cradle of enlightenment, it looked like barbarism and blind bigotry: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was myself a supporter of the Conservatives.
You might ask, why think about it now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students who adhere to center-right views is subjected to the same harassment.
This institutionalized and ever-growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as the one granted to disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives at Corpus Christi College's student club in Cambridge say they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and made to feel unwanted by guests" because of their political views.
They want to introduce an additional representative to the college’s Equal Rights Committee to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was only exacerbated by a recent BBC 2 documentary on student politics, Wonderland: Young, Smart and Right, in which conservatives were portrayed as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film featured Joe Cook, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, riding in a Rolls Royce, wearing a silver suit and a cane with a silver canopy.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they are being made “scapegoats due to higher tuition fees.”
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the University of Nottingham’s Conservative Association, said in an interview with a Sunday newspaper that “there is an increasing left-wing bias in the university environment.
People who don’t even know us think we’re brazen and reckless children of rich parents.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student in the history department of Corpus Christi College, where a request for enhanced protection was filed, called the atmosphere “uncomfortable,” and Stephanie Cherill, 19, the new president of the Oxford University Conservatives Association, said the student club’s attitude to right-wing centrists had deteriorated significantly.
“This poses a threat both to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and to the normal lives of the club members,” she says.
The first few weeks at Oxford I was not just in the minority, I was alone.
I went there in September 1986, a timid and shy eighteen-year-old girl.
Oxford was plagued by hatred for the Conservative Party.
A year earlier, the university had voted to deprive former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree due to a reduction in budget allocations for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even the Stalinists would be uncomfortable.
In the first days of the freshman week, when students get to know each other and the teachers, I felt for the first time what was waiting for me in front.
I did not know that the teachers not only looked through their fingers at the bullying of conservative students, but also took part in it with pleasure.
Political issues – the miners’ strike, privatization and the government’s opposition to sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa – have penetrated the wood-paneled walls of the auditoriums.
At my first seminar, I had to translate an eighteenth-century French text into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said the teacher, now the late Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
The text was difficult for me, I stopped.
Harry Pitt was a very gallant man with a face that looked like a cake.
“Thatcherists don’t teach French in principle, or do they just lack brains?” he asked.
The other students shrugged.
There were tears in my eyes.
“I advise you to take a few initial French lessons in your spare time, unless you’re, of course, very busy spinning around in society,” Pitt said.
I went back to my room very unhappy.
That night in college, I was sitting alone at lunch; then someone patted me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student from the Faculty of English, who introduced himself as a member of the University's Conservative Association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
- Unfortunately, the situation is as follows:
Anyone suspected of being sympathetic to conservatives will be mocked.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be harder for you.
Most first-year Conservatives pretend to be Labour.
Later, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to be a hypocrite.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
The trick didn't work.
A freshman from the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who studied at Eton himself, said: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contagious.”
Other students echoed his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
"How do conservatives have sex?" one of them asked.
- They're banging each other, aren't they?"
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before criminal prosecution was abolished in the sixties.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or will I have to meet with like-minded people only under the cover of night?
Will I be forced to become a Labour MP and hide my true beliefs?
The three years that lay ahead of me began to seem like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who did not hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for being Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of her speechwriters.
He barely showed up in college.
He despised him for his provinciality, pettiness, and commitment to a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he took up a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he told me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parents’ home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and impartial friends in the capital.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the forties, any political views were adopted there.
"But it's the best university in the world," he said sadly.
- They can't do that, except in the city of sleeping spires...
Even my communist friends have always behaved impeccably.”
His wet eyes darkened.
“Don’t make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you drop out of college."
I was exhausted by the constant trips to London and my emotional protection weakened.
My friend, also a conservative, could not stand the pressure and gave up his beliefs.
The following week, during a seminar, when another history teacher called me “the enemy of the people” very seriously, I decided to do the same.
In my soul, burned with shame, I admitted that "my parents brainwashed me," and called them "old fools."
The respite was short-lived.
The last nail in the coffin of my career at Oxford was destined to be hammered by my father.
At the time, he was writing two columns each week for Rupert Murdoch's publications.
My door was locked.
I did not go out, and five minutes later my pursuers surrendered.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a crybaby and a rag.
But at the age of eighteen, no one should become the object of such anger and intimidation in an educational institution.
The saddest thing is that it was Oxford, which not only released fourteen Tory prime ministers, but to this day hides behind an undeserved reputation of a university that values equality and freethinking.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
About the exhibition "Valentino: master of sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Nati Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornewitz and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this during the opening of Valentino: Master of Sewing, a triumphant retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 high-fashion dresses created by his “home” over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is "il Signore" Garavani, but it could not have been written without his illustrious clients.
Valentino always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of the nobility.
The first hall of this exhibition, open until March 3, abounds with personal letters and photographs signed by the most eminent aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Lord Snowden, including Marie Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from the humble tailor from the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international “elite”.
Being in love with the royal court is not a bad thing.
“They at least don’t put out their cigarette butts on your gorgeous carpet, like some beautiful pop stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornewitz.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an unparalleled host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
“We all loved coming to his chalet in Gstaad,” explains Heini’s ex-wife Thyssen, a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenia Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet, he is a star.
Valeria Macca, representing Valentino
Argentine model Valeria Mazza recalls a charismatic fashion designer.
One day we went to dinner at his house, it was after a fashion show in the Plaza de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty guests were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, Jr.
Valentino’s style manifested itself in everything – in every detail of his apartment, in its decoration, in food, in music.
“Each of the guests Valentino made feel important and loved,” recalls the “top model”, whose work with the fashion designer began in 1995 during the Week of haute couture in Paris.
“He never goes out of fashion because his sketches are real works of art,” she concludes.
The Pedigree Parade
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsessions, but of love with complete reciprocity.
He loves people with good upbringing and high titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been turned into a glamorous podium of sixty meters in length, which offers a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of models and must parade along the podium, contemplating the "spectators" of dreams that sparkle with Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her wedding dress.
In this audience, such names as Sibylla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn und Taxis, Mette-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg shine out of the models.
Nati Abascal and fashion designer, 2006
Many of these clients say that Valentino’s first love is “impossible to forget.”
I remember him perfectly.
These were trousers, a shirt, a vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter 1971-1972 collection.
“It was a gift he gave me,” says Nati Abaskal, one of the designer’s muse.
“I prefer him to the rest for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty,” adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors that he uses: they have a lot of light and they "fit" to his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion lawmaker Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg also can not forget the first time she dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed that I would have an age and a reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
That hour finally came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to wear to a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Linh.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with frills, a "corsage" in a fold and a cut without straps.
“It was a dream come true,” says Rodrigo d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her festive dresses from the fashion designer with "the utmost care... because the dress is not just a dress, it is also a collection of memories that accompany it."
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding to Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 “girls” (as the fashion designer calls his seamstresses) to make this ivory silk outfit with pearl inlays, twelve kinds of different laces and a four and a half meter train.
According to journalist Suzie Menkes, the greatest authority on the specialized press, the dress represents a high-fashion milestone of the late 20th century, “the return of clients from the upper world.”
Intoxicated for many years by the “lifestyle” of the elite, Valentino himself is now its best representative.
The Knight of the Grand Cross (a sign of distinction of the highest rank in Italy), the Cavalier of Labor, the Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, awarded the Order of the Legion of Honor, Garavani collected as many honors as any of the spouses of his clients.
“My attention has always been drawn to his sophistication, his calmness, his neat and flawless appearance,” D’Arenberg recalls.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my great friend.
"He was immaculate, time does not exist for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The hardest profession in the world: miners from Kawah Ijena
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk life and health, dragging 70 kilograms of sulfur to the top of the volcano on steep rocky trails
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of 400 miners who make a living mining sulfur in the volcano Kawah-Ijen, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Anto descends to the very bottom of the crater, where sulfurous gas rising from the depths of the Earth freezes upon contact with air.
Slitting huge pieces of sulfur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, rolls the baskets on his shoulders and carries them up a rocky road.
To the top of the volcano, whose height is 2,386 meters, only 250 meters, but exhausted loaders need more than 40 minutes to climb the turtle step, hardly keeping balance and carefully groping the road, so as not to stumble and fall off the cliff.
They know that one wrong step can cost them their lives, as happened to a tourist from France, who fell a few years ago from the cliffs of Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulfur they mine
Once at the top, they make their way between tourists who photograph them, as if they were monkeys from the circus and, tired of carrying heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scales, which the mining company located just above, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
It is about PT Kandi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating this volcano since 1960 and, better to say, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for every kilogram of sulfur.
Then it sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to petrochemical industries, because this mineral is common in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
“Since carrying 70 kilograms is the norm, we earn about 46,000 rupees (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.8) for each walk,” explains Anto, who usually performs three daily transfers.
He spends three hours on each of them and in the end feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
While this seems like a miser for such an inhuman effort, it is three times more than what he would have earned in the field.
"The daily fee for miners is very high by local standards, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the loader, who used to work as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the plot was not that heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a good reason, which in Indonesia is as crushing as sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where only Hindus, and brought her to Islam to take her to Java."
Anto has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly, and his eyes water because of toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years at risk in Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur had already begun to affect him despite the presence of a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly, and his eyes drool because of the toxic gases that the volcano emits.
This is the price you have to pay to achieve your dreams.
“I’ll work another two years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French,” he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished with life, this nice and smart young man could be a tour guide, waiter or porter at a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing a dirty wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sulfur does not stop flowing at night when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the dark.
Challenging the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, lighting his way with a small lantern connected to his helmet, which he himself bought with his own money.
About 400 porters drag baskets of sulfur on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company did not mechanize the extraction of sulfur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to porters who work on their own account and with such deprivations.
In fact, they don’t even receive a portion of the 30,000 rupees (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.5) photo fee, which, along with the entrance ticket for 15,000 rupees (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2), is charged by the guards of this reserve to tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and its people-mules.
“It’s a job for cattle, not people,” says Badrusin, a 42-year-old root-carrier who has spent three decades in Kawah Ijen since leaving college.
Capable of lifting up to 110 kilograms, he assures that he will endure the work "as much as he can" because he needs money for the education of his three children aged 18 to 10 years.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because a volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur burns their throats and burns their eyes, when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in the dense columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardy that no one complains of their severe diseases ... more serious, obviously, than their usual breathing problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and ulcers under the shoulders.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unaynik can now only lift 50 kilograms in his 53 years.
Every day, he and his comrades haul 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to a warehouse in Tamansari, covering a distance of 18 kilometers along a narrow path among thickets.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because a volcano is my whole life,” Unanik says, opening his mouth wide, missing a few teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years old, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult occupations in the world: what the human mullahs of Kawah Ijena are doing.
Singapore seeks children to save economy
Singaporeans blame careers, stress and housing and education prices for the lack of children.
“Singapore’s population needs to grow.”
I am a patriot husband, you are a patriot wife, we will fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the mintcake ad, but despite this — or perhaps because of it — this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local sayings like “Let’s put the bao (bun) in the stove” to laugh at Singapore’s birth rate.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, is hopeful that through advertising they will be able to draw attention to this issue in an entertaining way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people do “their national duty.”
This thing is exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world for reproducing our own kind, so we felt that this was a topic that we should address.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot, for example, to launch spirits with pheromones or to organize parties of quick acquaintances (blitz-dates).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing we can to solve this problem, which is rap?
1.2 children
Who does not take it so lightly, is the government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The state package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and provides tax breaks.
But all this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leadership and its strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its National Population Authority, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 – what is known as the replacement percentage – was in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tang Wei-min, director of the National Population Authority’s Policy Office for Married Couples and Families, said the reason was “improved education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of options when it comes to life goals and priorities beyond getting married and starting a family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms contribute to the increase in the number of bachelors and the postponement of marriages and the birth of children, resulting in a reduced birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policy, which aims to sharply increase immigration to counter population declines, is causing outrage among the local population.
There are websites in Singapore where there is barely disguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and refusing to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons Singapore’s ruling party scored its worst result in an election since independence last year.
After the elections there was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While falling birth rates have some impact on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, medical spending, and immigration policies, Singapore’s example is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts not to build so many small dwellings.
For example, this is beginning to affect the real estate sector.
The Urban Development Guide has moved to control the number of small apartments known as “footwear boxes” that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments of 46 square meters sell very well.
However, there is an opinion that they can contribute to an idle lifestyle and deprive the incentive of developers who want to build a large family home.
But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of home-building firm EL Developers, says their “shoeboxes” sell much faster than more spacious units.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are bought up for several days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash receipts are increasing.
However, he acknowledges that the new regulations provide clearer guidelines for developers who were previously hampered if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Over-stressed
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial district of the center, it seems that they will not have much effect.
“People are very overextended, housing is expensive, as is education, and because of this, many people put it off,” says the young manager.
Other people may have children.
“But it’s important for me to have my own money and time,” says another 20-year-old.
Men and women cite their careers, stress, and housing and education prices as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, as far as childbearing is concerned, Singaporeans have the final say.
Personal Offline - Personal Online
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is a property of private or “the sphere of private life, which have the right to protect against any interference”.
What is personal to a minor under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social media?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when discussing situations on the Internet that he would certainly not share offline?
elPeri<0xC3><0xB3>dico interviewed five guys between the ages of ten and 15, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with “something very mine,” on a personal level, and “password and username,” when they applied it to social media.
“My biggest secrets I wouldn’t upload to a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge as he tries to explain the meaning of personal on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world,” he says.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures from games.
I also have fun with my friends.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that wasn’t mine, or someone who was acting stupid,” he says.
The boy realizes that it is bad to publish indecent photos of naked people, crimes or write offensive or furious comments.
Jorge says he knows 35 of his friends on FB and nine of his followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother knows, she has a password to one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and to write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they’re responding to me, I’m just uploading them,” he adds.
“Social media is fun, I can talk to distant relatives or to my friends in a quick way,” he points out.
Without thinking, he replies that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
I wouldn't count on someone recommending it to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the latter admits that he does not know 20 people added to his friends list.
“It doesn’t scare me, because we have something in common, music, for example,” he points out.
According to the boy, no one rubbed him in confidence and did not ask for his home address or phone number.
“If I’m pressured or demanded, I’ll just delete them from my account,” he admits.
Jose became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experience of what is now known as cybermobbing.
A friend of mine was blackmailed on social media.
He was threatened and extorted money.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
The victim, according to Jose, did not delete the account.
"Just turned on the privacy."
It then explains the sequence of steps for setting up the account in a safe manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or confusing situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if I didn't like the person or if I wanted to.
“Although I know it’s cyber-mobbing,” he confirms.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and specialist in education and training, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The internet has emerged as a means of finding information, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game have changed,” she said.
Porras points out that academician Mark Prensky, a master of pedagogy at Yale University and author of Digital Aborigines and Immigrants, invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are they, children and young people who were born in the age of technology.
“We’re digital immigrants who have to teach them while we’re still learning,” she says.
He explains that the topic is complex, "because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be distributed, published or said, at an age when maturity is not enough for this."
“So that they are selective, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show what confidentiality is for children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do it is useless,” she adds.
Porras then lists some options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why are you doing it online?
Or would you like to be published a photo of you like the one you published about your friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you sign photos from parties, do you ask other people’s permission to celebrate them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing at any given moment?
Another point is to let them know that they should behave online in the same way as they do offline.
Rules are the same.
“Outside of the Internet, a person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, the same should be in social networks,” she says.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university lecturer, professor of primary education and education consultant, explains the need for heads of families to read social media policies in good faith.
Understanding each of the points, they have a good basis for conversations with children about the prerequisites for opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published,” he says.
According to Gaurdia, the key question is to remind children of the lesson of “don’t talk to strangers.”
UNASUR Summit Ends Without Promulgation of Lima Declaration
The VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the promulgation of the Lima Declaration, which was announced earlier and theoretically signed by seven mandatory participants.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the Presidential Administration indicated on the home page that it would be handed over after closure, but then confirmed that it would be published on the Peruvian Government website at some point.
When asked about the text, they pointed out that the contents had been laid out by the President of Peru, Ollanta Umala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists’ access to information about the Summit was limited at all times.
During the day, a video of the presidential assembly without a sound was broadcast in the press room with the message "closed meeting, sound is prohibited."
A little information circulated among the reporters was conveyed by the spokespersons of some UNASUR Governments present at the meeting, but not in Peruvian.
The only document circulated during the day was a list of participating presidents, sparking outrage from hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the administration of the President of Peru sent an electronic message to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but this is a statement of Umala, and not an official document, which ended the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and at that time, despite the insistence of the press, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been announced, was also not circulated.
On the official ASPA website, you can check that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to ensure that transmission systems for all journalists are in place, but have limited the flow of information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to accept the verdict of the Hague court, which will settle the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they would abide by the ruling of the International Court of Justice, which begins hearing statements from both sides in The Hague on Monday, as part of the indictment Lima filed against Santiago.
“We will abide by and enforce a decision that clarifies the differences we are currently submitting to this international court,” Umala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of differences, pacts and international tribunals,” Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era added, and welcomed Umala with a handshake against the background of the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they would submit to the International Court of Justice came just after Colombia protested this week the Bogota Pact, under which it recognized submission to the verdicts of that international court following its decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered wrong.
The summit was held in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been suspended since 2011 following the impeachment of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Umala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit, just after noon Lima time.
The head of state read the final document, in which he said that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 projects among South American countries had been approved, the amount of the proposed investment was $ 17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will take “important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding residency agreements.”
He said that action was being taken to improve “cooperation against citizen uncertainty and organized transnational crime, action to increase the availability of medicines, affordable Internet access in all corners of South America and to take into account the risks of natural disasters in a comprehensive and effective manner.”
As Europe is in crisis, “economic unification [of Latin America] should not have a triumphant foundation, but should serve to expand our productive foundation and envision a better future for our cities,” Umala added.
“We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve the connectivity of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and forming new economic schemes,” the Peruvian president said in a read-out message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five are Peru-related and are limited to transverse axes in its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two are aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide further details.
The final document also touched upon the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to rejoin the Union of South American Nations,” from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, to be united and to have good relations between neighbours, was another theme highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before embarking on the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, in Mexico City on Saturday to hold respectful talks on the maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of an international court challenged by Bogotá.
"The day after tomorrow (Saturday), I may meet with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
“We will review all these paths, they are not mutually exclusive, including the pact with Nicaragua will require a discussion with Nicaragua,” he said.
“With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,” Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they are scheduled to attend the inauguration of the country’s new president, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
Also during the summit, the bloc’s defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and unanimity on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the latter has been suspended.
Peru holds the presidency of the regional bloc.
South America must learn from Europe on citizenship integration: Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which “South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe.”
Correa, who participated in the sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, told state television Peru that Europeans "killed each other during World War II" and in other clashes, "but now they are practically one homeland."
He defended, in this context, the South American Citizenship Project, which was endorsed by the UNASUR countries.
“It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to take us back to the past,” he warned.
The Ecuadorian President has also shown himself to be a supporter of the renewal of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who signed the San Jose Pact on human rights.
Those who give lectures never make any commitments, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
“It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and funded by the United States,” he said, alluding to Ecuador’s political asylum given to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision, because with him he did not betray his principles, but respected his “deep values of democracy and human rights.”
He added that at the time, "there were certain suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and the process would not be respected."
He also criticised Swedish justice for requiring to come to his territory for questioning over an alleged sexual offence, while “Swedish law itself considers it possible to implement it through a videoconference that could be made from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.”
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration of Assange’s physical and mental health.
“I haven’t spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me he had a small lung problem, nothing serious,” he said.
What is really there is the danger of deterioration of his physical and mental health due to imprisonment in a small space without the ability to do exercises in the air.
“It affects the health of any person,” he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum problem granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by providing a guarantee of immunity that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judiciary, and stressed that there were negotiations in London to find a solution to the problem of the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate on human rights, this is the word we do not use in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judiciary, because Assange’s lawyer, Baltasar Garson, is conducting a number of trials in various European instances,” he said.
He said: “If the UK gives us a guarantee of immunity tomorrow, it will be over.
And if Sweden, as perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has done on other occasions, interrogate Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or interrogate him via Skype, tomorrow this problem will be exhausted.
Correa took the opportunity to prove himself as a defender of press freedom and stressed that he does not tolerate "mediocreness, dishonesty and lies that distort freedom of expression."
“The main enemies of press freedom are not the corrupt villains of politics, but the bad journalists who support profiteering, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In this regard, he was satisfied that neither these journalists, nor the bankers, nor the bourgeois hegemon countries dominate in Ecuador, and added that, being re-elected, he would “deepen the revolution in order to continue development in the right direction.”
Correa also supported Paraguay’s decision to retain its veto in UNASUR until at least the next elections, arguing that the organization “must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support coups under the guise of legality” because in reality “it has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy”.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President considered the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries in the wake of the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which was in favour of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty, to be “completely justified”.
This decision is not being respected at the moment.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
We need to work together to overcome them and keep moving forward.
He also expressed hope for a good conclusion to the dispute over maritime borders, which is being conducted in the same court of Peru and Chile, and said that "it is right for Latin America to appeal to international bodies if the two countries commit to make a decision, no matter how difficult it may be."
Regarding the possibility of running as a candidate in the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador to run for a third term in a row, he indicated that he considers this possibility “with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult”.
Correa assured that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will leave public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in such unjust situations as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement felt that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to accept that responsibility,” he said.
If I win, it would be my last term as president, and then we're out of public life.
If we lose, it's the same.
“This is a decision,” he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he went for a treatment that had already been planned, routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean an aggravation of President Chavez's health," he said.
The Head of State of Ecuador took part today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
Deaths from AIDS today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was announced that his AIDS test had given a positive result.
"I was stunned," he recalls that difficult, despite all the tact of the doctor, the moment.
The young man hid it from his family.
Deciding to cope with the disease on his own, he wanted to learn about it as much as possible. And his efforts were justified - he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the “oldest” patients of the HIV department of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he got in 1994, having overcome many obstacles.
He has been living with the diagnosis of "human immunodeficiency virus" (HIV) for 22 years. In the early 90s, it would be hard to believe - too few treatment options existed then, too little was known about the disease, too biased towards the patients.
So, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of social protection did not want to say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut."
In other words, in those days to have AIDS was a sentence.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so without degrading the quality of life.
However, without knowing about their illness, still many people come when the virus has already caused damage, “exhausted” their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, “the great achievement at the moment is that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same,” said the head of the HIV department of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information was confirmed in April.
HIV/AIDS infection expert Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the duration and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system that patients have at the beginning of diagnosis, with the best life expectancy in those who do not use drugs: up to 500 years, and CD with the number of
Simply put, the above means that someone who receives an HIV-positive diagnosis at the age of 25, according to these terms, "maintaining control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years," he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), and it is also true that since the advent of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths have already been reported by May this year; however, it is claimed that there is widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
Why are there still deaths?
Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how things are in our hospital.
For at least the last 12 years, we have not had a shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late because they are not aware of their infected condition, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to carry out diagnostics at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for detection on a mass scale, for all people who request it.”
In their proposal, experts and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (COESIDA), as well as patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who turned for verification to a private laboratory, motivated only by the fact that it did his friend and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered from sarcoma Capola.
Things change when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die, and they don't want to know.
"If I die anyway, I'd rather fight three times a week," they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, do exercises, take medications.
To date, his parents only know that he suffered cancer.
I live a normal life like anyone else.
“I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, I take care of myself and another person,” said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO to encourage his statement by those who now, in the context of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Let them check, if there was a risk of infection, let them find out as soon as possible whether they are HIV-positive, so it is better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
This report summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a huge gap between health programs and the common citizen, according to Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has tackled the HIV problem.
The biggest one is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "in fact, the prevalence of condoms has increased, we used to be given one or two, now we are given packages of a hundred, and this is very good, but it turns out that there are those who still do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
“Why do you need them?” is a popular question, with exasperation and condemnation, from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy staff and health care workers who don’t want to hear teenagers, the propagandist assured.
I propose to change this inefficient distribution; so that condoms are not only behind the counters and that a hundred of them are in vending machines in public toilets in places frequented by young people.
This is not a promotion of promiscuity.
It’s not about paying for a beer and a motel, Governor Emilio González said when asked if condom distribution was possible under his leadership.
“It’s not sexuality, it’s best to make condoms available to those who already practice sexual activity,” he said.
Key data in Jalisco
There were 13,435 total cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state ranks 4th in the national ranking for new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th for HIV.
92% of infections are due to the sexual route, 6% through the blood and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as for one registered case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know about it.
Given the ratification by the United States Court of Appeals of a decision that nullifies the Vitro Group’s debt restructuring achieved through competitive bidding in Mexico, the scenario sets a fatal precedent for any national company with branches in a neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It seems that the procedures in support of the survival of firms that are allowed by Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the stripes and stars, contrary to international agreements.
In practical terms, the approval of Judge Harlin Hale’s June 15 ruling in the Bankruptcy Court of the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican firms defenseless in the face of the possibility of arresting their property on the other side of the Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens the door to a leading glass producer in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court, citing three inconsistencies.
As an introduction, while the judge of the case notes that creditors must be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, located in New Orleans, says the main proceedings concern bankruptcy proceedings pending in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of enterprises of a transnational profile.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law was created, defining the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Second, the verdict states that without the inter-firm vote, recognized in the critical mass of the bankruptcy debt that Vitro had before the parent company branches, the majority necessary to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, among them Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitive Proceedings.
It is also true that, by subtracting the votes of the branches, Vitro’s creditors, who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely vulture funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergenceia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached the majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37 per cent.
These data are omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of the difficult situation it has faced since 2008, affected by the serious economic crisis that has overtaken the United States by striking the country.
In the meantime, the Gonzalez Sada family firm will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal itself, so that the vote reaches its plenary, that is, five judges, given that only three voted.
In the event of failure, an application for a certificate will be filed, which will require a review of the process by the highest court, in this case the United States Supreme Court.
Worst of all, the court rejected a document sent by the Mexican government in the role of amicus curiae (“friend of the court”), which describes the process Vitro follows under the Bankruptcy Act, signaling that it is exempting itself from complying with agreements signed by both countries to link it to Article 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, it is noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules established for cases of interstate insolvency, which guarantee equal rights for debtors and creditors.
A carom from two sides: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
Overall balance
Given the months-delayed complaints placed on the table by the Mexicana de Aviaci<0xC3><0xB3>n trade unions against former company owner Gaston Ascarraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent management, the Union Airmen’s Pilots Association has already discovered a bottleneck.
The instance, headed by Carlos Diaz Chavez Morino, has just filed a criminal case against the National Commission on Banks and Securities, which is accused of obstructing justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority systematically refused to submit reports to the General Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic regarding the operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from the trust fund of F/589 of IXE Bank 198 million pesos, on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
The funds would be used to buy shares of the Professional Hotel Management Company.
As you know, Askarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Surrounded by Dragon Mart
At a weekend forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of the general civil society approved the creation of a broad front to counter the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a giant center of sales and distribution to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean countries of products of an isolated country, with a residential area nearby for the employees of 150 companies.
Earlier, Canacintra managed to unite the governors of the south-eastern zone to confront the monumental forces that razed part of the protected territories and pose serious threats against the industry.
Death of ACTA
Regarding the Senate’s rejected request to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as the acronym in English ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the case has already been moved to the archives.
As you know, the action was carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself disqualified the opportunity to consider it as violating the freedom of expression in social networks.
Homex in the long run
In an effort to pay off long-term debts without affecting short-term ones, Homex is placing 500 million pesos of exchange certificates on the market.
The issue is the first of four identical ones, with an offer to pay interest every 28 days.
Competition is coming to light
Formed by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, the information technology leaders, a consortium with the trade name Competition has just been born, its goal will be the software cluster services market in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
An avid basketball traveler Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years associated with this sport and, thanks to him, traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector "Hettin" Reyes.
Before a brain hemorrhage confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a small-scale player, a Major League basketball player, a BSN commissioner and head of the Bayamon Cowboys, and the president of the Basketball Federation.
“I’ve played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at once, like when I was president of BSN, CEO of the National Team and president of the federation in the 90s,” Reyes recalls during a visit to Primera Hora at his home in Bayamon, where he has lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball was my life.
Reyes does not exaggerate by making this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia collected over his long journey, testify to this.
Bayamon in the Heart
With the greatest emotions he keeps those who remember his way through the Cowboys, from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years of his performance as a co-agent or contract agent.
“These have been my best years, which I enjoyed the most because I’ve had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboys championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager.
There were many years of joy, including five championships that took place from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincey’s BSN debut.
From that moment on, Cuco Ortiz, who was a great administrator, became the leader,” Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who was on his way here and was at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, telling me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7".
"Do you?"
And that was the beginning of Minsi, one of the best players that Puerto Rico had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gauss, who was granted citizenship and became one of our top scorers.
I remember saying that if Minsi had brought the championship to Bayamon, Gauss would have helped win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboys championship with Gauss, but already at a distance, because by 1988 I was already listed as the head of the federation.
By that time, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and Minnie’s achievements in the national team.
I remember the first time we won the U.S. at the Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got fourth place and it had to be bronze if not for the Canadian referee who forced us to replay the final game, Reyes said.
Is that team from the 1990 World Cup the best team you've ever seen?
She is among the best, as well as the one who won from the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the one from the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and beat the U.S. team, which was pretty similar to the one that won bronze at the World Cup.
Not only did Mincey, Gauss, Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Rivas, Fico L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, and Piculina (Ortiz), but also the young (Havier) To<0xC3><0xB1>ito Col<0xC3><0xB3>n and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Kihote' Morales, who was unable to participate in the 90s due to a knee injury.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Neuquen, Argentina.
With role players like ‘Kanito’ Nieves, Pablo Alyce and young Rolando Hurruitner replaced by players temporarily suspended for disorderly conduct in the Mar del Plata Pan American Championship, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it was Piculin Ortiz.
His performances in international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated at this level the way Pikulin did.
And that doesn’t take into account his career in the different leagues he played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very difficult question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From a young age, I really like the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you consider to be your greatest achievement in the Federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 90s BSN had up to 17 teams per season.
What do you have left to do?
There were things I wanted to implement, such as regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, let the boys from Ponce play only in their field and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the guys travel and play too much, and it's unnecessary.
At the very least, I see the fruits of mandatory certification and coursework for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball matches.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world famous for his starring role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the Dallas television series, in which he portrayed a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series Dallas became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas season, died Friday night from complications caused by cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the Dallas-based production studio.
“Larry has returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again playing the iconic role he most enjoyed,” his family said in a statement.
Larry’s family and closest friends were with him at the Dallas Thanksgiving Fair.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and sequel, was next to Hagman when he died at Dallas Hospital, her rep said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him very much.
“He was an original personality and lived a full life,” Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and admitted to drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a liver transplant.
Long before "Dallas", Hagman had gained notoriety on television for his role as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he plays Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is changed when he meets an attractive genie girl played by Barbara Eden and begins to live with her under one roof.
He was also the main character in two comedies that rarely aired, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His work in film included well-received roles in The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was his masterful interpretation of the delightfully repulsive J.R. that brought Hagman to the top of his glory.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its entourage aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan “Who Shot J.R.?”, conceived to create hype around the episode, full of emotions in which Hagman’s character is almost killed, gave rise to international discussions and millions of dollars at risk in bookmakers.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the series at that time.
When the answer was given in the November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers watched it and turned Dallas into the second most watched entertainment program in history, after the finale of MASH in 1983, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Christine (played by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. stopped her and then threatened to charge her with prostitution if she didn't get out of town, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupt man with a charismatic smile: an dishonest businessman and an unfaithful husband who wanted his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), put on treatment.
“I know what should be on J.R.’s gravestone,” Hagman said in 1988.
It must be said, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
It's the only deal he's ever lost.
Victoria Principal, also the heroine of the original series, recalled on Friday Hagman as someone "huge, both on and off the screen."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each of us who are lucky enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new release of "Dallas" were shown a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
Five episodes of the second season have already been recorded and the sixth was in production, the channel reported.
Warner or TNT have not yet made a statement about what will happen to the series after Hagman's departure.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who shone in such classic works as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the stage in New York in the early 1950s, and then served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met the young Swedish artist Mai Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he titled his memoir "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t include anything that I thought was capable of hurting anyone or affecting them in any way,” he told Prensa Asociada at the time.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients experiencing fear.
“I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go into surgery, and after,” he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some consolation, like "don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you'll be fine."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Begins a course that explores "The End of the World"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Sharme decided to read a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible lure: the end of the “long countdown” of the Mayan calendar, December 21, which many people seized on as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharma had no idea what was coming in the next couple of months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis that some call the “long Armageddon,” and the growing conflict that Israel will be drawn into, a place where end-time Christian theorists believe the apocalypse will begin.
“I didn’t realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester of all,” Sharme told Rutgers-Camden University students this week.
If you analyze what is happening in the world at the moment, as if we only have 30 days left, it was a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those who have an apocalyptic mindset.
And he’s not the only professor to offer “end of the world” courses this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, Associate Professor Barry Wacker teaches a course in Media, Culture, and the End of the World.
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
“We’re analyzing why these ideas spread over time,” he said, and the way in which hypothetical scenarios that trigger certain human actions are proposed.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war can break out.
This month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic themes and studied how they relate to real-life examples.
“I tried to tell the students what was probably plausible and impossible,” Wacker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of art history and anthropology, have teamed up to read a course called simply “The End of the World.”
"We're not adding '2012' to always be able to read the course again in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the “inevitable destruction,” students must study, prepare projects, and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students with no choice but to work “until the very night the world supposedly ends,” Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
“The places ended in two hours,” Restall said of his course for high-middle-class students, which was attended by 35 students.
We received emails for many weeks before the semester began from people who asked if there were any more places.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
“I like to watch what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridged Robinson, a 23-year-old student in the Department of Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic way of thinking, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or lack thereof.
Will Vekesa, a 25-year-old student in the Department of Psychology and Nursing, said he watched all the apocalyptic movies.
“I’ve never heard of a course that would teach this,” he said.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed — not to mention the professor — said they believed in the end-of-the-world date of December 21.
“Our first project affected the Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredited it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior student at Temple University in West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key moment in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic concern in Western culture that goes back several centuries, where people react to the changes around them, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
“In other places, people don’t think about it,” he said.
Primarily in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered a question about whether he knew of any course about the “end of the world” there.
“The Philippines is not taking part in the end of the world,” he wrote, alluding to an order from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that many days of the last trial had long been talked about, and said that if nothing happened on December 21st, “people would immediately start thinking about the next date” or philosophizing that December 21st was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and teachers are very cautious about this date.
Some said they were going to end-of-the-world parties.
“Maybe I’ll call one of my friends and have a laugh,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
