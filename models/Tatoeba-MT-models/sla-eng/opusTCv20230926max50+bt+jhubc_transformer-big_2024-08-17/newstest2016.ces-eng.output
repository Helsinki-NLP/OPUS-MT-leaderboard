In an emergency call, the professor confessed to shooting his girlfriend.
During a call to the emergency line with a trembling voice, Professor Shannon Lamb confessed to the police that he had shot his girlfriend and it was necessary for them to come to their house.
Lamb assumed that his "sweet dog" was alive and probably upset at home, and that the dead woman's family contacts could be found on her phone.
Inside, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note on white office paper: "I'm so sorry and wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," the letter, signed by Lamb, said.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would drive 300 miles to the school campus where police believe he shot favorite professor Ethan Schmidt in the door of his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb reportedly made a fateful phone call to the emergency line shortly after.
Finally, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the shooting at the school forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, authorities are still trying to find out what Lamb's motivation was.
The details released by state investigators and the students and staff who knew him together created an image of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to their lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed he had no criminal record or violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote to thank the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History along with 17 other faculty members, and many students took courses at both at the same time.
At the same time, there were inclinations when it comes to problems.
The student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shaken, "as if something were wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was struggling with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for time off for health reasons, saying he had some kind of problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the recruitment of university staff meant that the doctorate, on which Lamb worked hard, would not guarantee him an automatic tenure to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamb was obviously troubled by something."
Lamb won't answer these questions anymore.
After leaving the campus, police caught his trail as he crossed the Arkansas state line back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single gunshot in the backyard of a house about a mile from his parents in a suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington state coroner Methel Johnson confirmed.
He left the car on the street.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, though Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in the city, which has a population of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and education classes.
In the spring he received his doctorate in education.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamba was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school and he was the great older guy who tutored her on guitar for several years.
He was quite a heartbreaker back then.
The hearts of all the girls were quickened as soon as he appeared,” said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the Jackson suburb.
Lamb and Prentiss reportedly dated for a while.
During the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house adjacent to the shoulder of the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19.
"She was a total wreck," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She was my mother's best friend.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he knew that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail performed at the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, a sweat Lamb finished on guitar and harmonica for a small crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We chatted and recorded each other's jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a murdered professor, led a first-year seminar and specialized in original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the boys' student club and student government.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, staff, students and community members, attended a candlelight memorial event.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also attended the vigil, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The school started again on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis filed a report in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to the report.
This story has been modified to reflect the fact that the police now claim that Lamb made the emergency phone call after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us says it won’t hire as many seasonal workers as it did last year, but the children’s toy and product maker says it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also said it plans to hire about 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, down from 45,000 last season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company says it will start recruiting candidates this month, and will recruit staff during October through December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching, and companies are preparing to temporarily hire employees to help with stores and sales, to ship and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his 'date' with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the royal family to arrive when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized Princess Diana would be sitting there," he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, "Back in Time."
The film begins, and I realize I'm within range of what could be called a fake date with a Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time," is a documentary about "Back to the Future," featuring interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson, and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said: “It’s truly the best travel document that has ever been filmed for me.”
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in select theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s accelerated military support for Syria is that “there is no military solution” to the nearly five-year-old conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a news conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of five permanent councils of countries — the US, Russia, China, Britain and France — on the sidelines of a ministerial meeting of the General Assembly later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He expressed regret that divisions in the Council and among the Syrian people and regional powers "made this situation unsolvable."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they have shown in reaching an Iranian nuclear deal to resolve the crisis in Syria.
8 Election Numbers That Show Donald Trump in Real Light
Some have tried to label him as a person who often changes his mind.
The others waved their hands as if they were a joke gone wrong.
And some are preparing for implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they are not succeeding (yet).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in the lead by a double-digit number, and some people are beginning to seriously ask what this means for the real estate mogul’s nomination chances.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time of 2011, Rick Perry’s management made its way to Herman Cain’s rise, in the end, neither of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why you might run into a general election.
But outside groups such as Jeba Bush’s Super PAC and the economic conservative Club for Growth are aware of Trump’s will to hold out and are starting to put their dollars on the line to topple him.
Here are some recent voting numbers that suggest the real estate mogul is not just a passing phase:
Trump’s approval rating has turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University vote showed that only two out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers are held in the initial stages.
After the Quinnipiac University vote last week, it was found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be “outraged” by his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be “enthusiastic” against 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next closest in level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “dissatisfied” or “disturbed” if Jeb Bush’s business favorite became a candidate.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bloatedness and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide are inclined to the idea that the real estate magnate has the right temperament for the presidency, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll Monday.
The same number is held in the Iowa State Senators’ Club, which is the first in the nation where 52 percent of Republicans think they have the personality of a commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn’t have the personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 in 10 independents say his temperament doesn’t belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republicans are getting used to this idea.
When they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
Asked who was most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That’s the change from late July, when four out of 10 bet their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the brightest crystal ball in the past.
By this time last cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans had selected Rick Perry as the winner of the nomination against 28 percent for the eventual nomination of Mitt Romney.
Yet it turns out that a number of GOP voters see Trump’s campaign as credible.
Even though Republicans have gathered around another candidate, Trump still defeats almost everyone.
Some scholars point out that the fragmented field likely contributes to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffused among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical direct battle between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christi by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead the trader by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one match.
The vast majority of Trump supporters say they have already made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only more than half of voters supporting Trump say they will not change their minds.
Obviously, this can change a lot of things, and no one can really say that they would never change their mind.
46% say they keep the back door open for a change between candidates.
Still, Trump’s current strongest opponent is his out-of-state neurosurgeon colleague Ben Carson, but voters who see their views as definitive would be twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 out of 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “rapists” in his campaign announcement speech, immigration is still holding up as the main and central topic of conversation for 2016.
Some fear that Trump’s tumult will draw key Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding efforts.
But according to a new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the topic of immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain too.
Frustration with the government is reaching new highs.
Today, Donald Trump and Ben Carson receive about half the support of Republican voters, primarily because of their condition as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in a new ABC/Post poll on Monday say they would rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg vote in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are “dissatisfied” and 21 percent are “hell-struck.”
The House backed a larger share of the state from coal fees.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
The Chamber of Deputies in the first reading supported the government amendment to the upper law, which regulates the amount of fees from surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) promised MPs that thanks to this, they would receive additional money from both the state treasury and the budgets of the municipalities.
The bill has been criticized by opposition MPs, who fear that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have so far, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House in the first reading supported the government amendment to the upper law, which, among other things, means that the state should receive a greater part of the proceeds of fees from surface mining of brown coal.
The share of the state will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will decrease from the previous 75 percent to 33 percent.
The draft also changes the way the payment for the minerals that the companies extract is calculated.
The change in mining fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the state treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenues of the municipalities are supposed to have a neutral impact, because the fee is supposed to be higher.
Last year, municipalities received about 450 million crowns from fees and the state budget received 150 million crowns.
From the extraction of brown coal, about 200 million crowns went to the municipalities and 66 million crowns to the state.
The amendment also envisages an increase in the payment from mining areas with permitted extraction to CZK 1,000 per hectare per year.
The income from these payments should continue to belong in full to the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) told MPs that thanks to this, municipalities will receive CZK 14 million to CZK 100 million per year instead.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but determined by the government by its regulation.
The remuneration shall be newly calculated as a product of the amount of mineral extracted and the rate for each type of mineral.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
ODS MP Marek Benda, however, warned that setting the fee by government decree may not be in line with the constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, it is not a tax in this case, because the state charges for the mineral, which is state property.
Fees are only received by municipalities whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three-quarters of the municipality's money and a quarter of the state's.
The same will be the case in the case of the extraction of radioactive rocks.
Part of the money that the state will collect on mining fees will be purpose-bound.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide a mine rescue service.
The proposal was criticized by opposition MPs, who claimed in particular that it would damage the villages affected by the mining and the regions.
For example, Michal Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era (TOP 09 and the Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just so that the Minister of Finance improves his budget," said David Kádner (Dawn) elected in the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem Region.
Hana Aulická, a member of the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M, warned about the increase in unemployment in Mostecko.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era wanted to return the law to the government for completion.
The explanatory note states that, according to mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, since prices are more than 90 percent long-term contracted.
Major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should therefore not feel the price increase.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in payments by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
According to her, however, the increase in fees in terms of employment is bearable.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment, Milan Urban (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), it is crucial that the MPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining even before the law is approved.
If coal is also extracted beyond the limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovak Army should be made only after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the bottom of the CSA should be broken already for social, economic reasons and because of the long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.
Vesel<0xC3><0xBD> will lead the Czech Republic as a leader, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear at the Davis Cup draw in India on the blackboard on Thursday, and this time each of them is likely to intervene in the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navrátil plans to spread the burden over the whole quartet due to difficult conditions.
Delhi is hot and humid, which is why they expect tough matches that can stretch up to five hundred.
We have to take that into account.
I'd like to spread it out according to the weather.
And depending on how it looks, Navrátil said during today’s training of the Czech selection in the center of Raja Kumar Khanna.
Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Vesel<0xC3><0xBD> counts with the number one team and the world top 40 into both Friday and Sunday’s singles.
Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Rosol and Radek <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánek are probably in the second position.
I want almost everyone involved.
I've got it slowly in my head, but I won't say it yet, the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech national team should be <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánek's participation in Saturday's doubles.
It is only a question of who will stand next to the experienced deblista, who has a score of 18:4 in the Davis Cup doubles.
He probably won't be happy.
There are still options with Rosol or Adam Pavlasek.
"I really don't know who or what it's going to look like," Navratil said.
It will be decided according to the development of the two-player game.
A variant may be Pavlásek, with Vesel<0xC3><0xBD> surprised in the 1st round by winning in the doubles over the Australians.
"He's good for the trunk," Navrátil said.
I have done well against Australia and when I play, I would like to do the same performance that I have done since the second set.
"I like the experience and I would like to bring a point," Pavlásek said.
The home side will put Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP rankings), who won the challenger in Shanghai last week, where he defeated the third and fourth-hundredth players in the rankings.
The second is Somdev Devvarman (164).
Both of them are Challenger players and our players have experience from the ATP Tour, but many times we have already seen that the rankings in the Davis Cup do not decide.
"It's the current form, the weather," Navrátil said.
Friday's opening singles starts at 6:30 CEST and can be delayed due to the weather.
According to the forecast, it is supposed to rain and the court is not under the roof.
However, it can be played under artificial lighting.
They've already lit it, and it's got about two thousand luxs, which is enough.
"You should be able to play it under the lights," Navratil said.
Jeremy Corbyn to debut on Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's PMQ debut has been highly anticipated.
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut in Prime Minister's Questions later, and will have his first collaboration with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will pose the first of his six allocated questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be scrutinised by the media and Members.
In a weekly statement, he asked for “less theatre and more facts.”
He also said he might skip a few sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby’s leadership, which comes after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the annual TUC Congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader’s decision to stand in silence while singing the national anthem in service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has met with criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and is the focus of several front-page stories.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention.
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he would "stand in respectful silence" and would recognise "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
But Mr Corbyn’s shadow cabinet member, Owen Smith, told BBC Two’s Newsnight programme that he would recommend the Labour leader sing the national anthem “regardless” of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve on Mr Corbyn’s top team, citing differences in the economy, defense and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political differences in the workplace are also "collapsed" after Mr Corbyn's appointment despite his position in the European Union and the government's limit on benefits.
Mr Corbyl told the TUC conference that the Workers' Party had tabled amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the benefit limit.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the secretary of shadow work and pensions, said the party had "very clearly" opposed government plans to reduce the limit from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron in the decade since his election as Conservative leader.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas “from the crowd” on questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North argues that PMQ is too confrontational and that it will refrain from both "quick answers" and toothed trade, and instead promises to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn says Angela Eagle, the shadow trade secretary, will represent him at PMQ if he does not attend — such as when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also dropped the idea of letting other colleagues speak for him from time to time because he was told that he had still discussed the matter with House Speaker John Bercow.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" style of politics that was often associated with PMQ, but admitted years later that it had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of leaders' judgment, their leadership of the House, and their attitude among other MPs, although critics have argued that it has become a caricature and that far-reaching reforms are needed.
"Photography in Joburg": Young Homeless Trained as Photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a tough place to be homeless.
But one group of ex-street kids found a way to learn and make a living.
"I was photographed in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take photos of their neighborhood and earn money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

The pound is rising, while wage growth in the UK is accelerating
The pound jumped the following dates and showed a recovery in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was led higher by the SABMiller bidding target.
Between May and June, GB’s earnings, including bonuses, rose 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
That was the fastest since 2009, and it looked as if estimates were coming up on when rates would rise.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar at $1.5505 and was 0.84% up against the euro at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock on the market and jumped 20% after getting a close bid from its rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and bring closer brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Shares of Burberry were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont’s latest sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, have started to rise again.
Shares in Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said they rose $2.5bn through shared placement as part of a debt-reduction strategy.
Shares in Mondi’s packaging and paper group were the biggest drop on the index and fell 4.3 percent, after Goldman Sachs downgraded its rating on the firm to “sell.”
JD Sports surged 3.1% after the sports company reported an 83% jump in pre-tax profits in the middle of the year <0xC2><0xA3>46.6m
JD Sports boss says higher wages could hurt expansion
JD Sports’ executive chairman, Peter Cowgill, says a higher minimum wage for workers in the UK could mean “greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But it is unlikely that purchasing power would outweigh the higher wage costs in his firm, he says.
The cost could hit plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Opponents of the Prague apartment marshmallow cheer.
Controversial building got a stop sign.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision to be unlawful and will appeal against it.
Hundreds of people protested against the building, which is to be built in the immediate vicinity of the Agnes Monastery in the center of Prague, in front of the Prague 1 office, and a petition was also created.
In the decision, the municipality stated that there was a violation of the building law, because not all the requirements of the zoning decision were observed.
"The territorial decision in question does not contain certain elements, for example, the type of land, the distance from neighboring buildings, the sufficiently clearly and clearly described shape of the building, the definition of the territory affected by the impact of the construction," it said.
The municipality also considers it illegal that some of the documents for the decision were issued to the originally discussed documentation, but this has changed.
This is, for example, the position of environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to be built on the grounds of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
It follows from the records that, however, the owner of the land has only evidenced consent to the project documentation for the territorial management, not consent to the location of the building on their land, writes the Department of Building Regulations.
According to Francesco Augusto Razetto of the investor firm, the building code department did not take note of the decision of the superior authority - the Ministry of Regional Development, according to which the deadline for the initiation of the review had already expired.
Either way, it is a scandalous process.
"We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, we comply with all the laws of the Czech Republic and we respect all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razetto said in a press release.
The project, which people call marshmallow due to the allegedly proposed color of the facade, evokes strong emotions in Prague.
In the past, hundreds of people have gathered in the city centre to protest against the construction.
Associations and residents of nearby houses resent that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticize the unsuitability of the building for the historical center of Prague and the immediate vicinity of the Agnes Monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Fránek, the project has changed several times.
The original form of the project from 2008, which included a glazed facade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Heritage Institute (NP<0xC3><0x9A>) and in 2010 the permission of the Prague monument keepers was revoked.
The new project of the company Praga Progetti e Investimenti with windows in the shape of faces but NP<0xC3><0x9A> and the magistrates approved and on this basis a building permit was issued.
The author of the proposal rejects the objections of opponents, saying that he never counted on a facade in pink color, which gave the project the nickname of a pink-and-white confectionery.
The Czech politician drove the migrants.
The Hungarians put him and them in jail.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to the refugees.
Along the way, he and his crew took three Syrian refugees into the car, who they said were about half a kilometer away.
It was not criminal in Hungary at the time, he told Lidové noviny.
We knew that the guardians of the law did not take such action.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, they arrested us and transferred us to investigative detention in Szeged, he described the letter.
In the end, the politician spent nine hours in the cell.
Police said the officers behaved correctly, but communication was limited because they did not speak English very well.
According to him, the prison was a mess.
For example, in our cell about three by four meters, 15 refugees from Syria were crowded.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
“These people were locked up the next day and because of the language barrier, none of them had any idea what was going to happen to them,” Berg said.
What can’t they entertain anymore?
Ask the President of the Executive Chamber.
From 9:30 a.m. on Friday, September 18th, the President of the Czech Executive Chamber, Mgr. Pavla Fu<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>ková, will answer the readers’ questions.

Metcash launches rural campaign to fight Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the onslaught of Aldi in southern and western Australia.
Metcash launches rural campaign to fight Aldi invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first of more than 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA retailers and suppliers are adding brands such as Simmo’s Dunsborough-based ice cream maker offering tastings at IGA stores, and store owners are selling discounted tickets to the Australian Football League to local customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the food, alcohol and hardware retailer celebrates its annual strategic investor day.
There is a lot at stake, as southern and western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcash IGA’s business moves and generate higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in South and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in the SA and 24 percent in WA compared to about 14 percent in the Eastern states.
In any case, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will account for 5 percent of the food market in the two states within 12 months of the opening of the first stores, which took revenues from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retail could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash $250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the West over the next year, and will generate sales of $500 million and $600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in Metcash’s fixed price base could cost it around $13 million in pre-tax revenue, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA shoppers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes Metcash’s food sales will fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will decline from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the fund’s managing director Hamish Douglass, founder of the Magellan financial group, said that business lunches in Melbourne could “highly likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to publicly respond to Douglass' comment.
But it is known that a Metcash board member contacted Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and Metcash's food store earnings, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retail stores, have fallen 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational developments of a change in speculation as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, wholesalers have counterattacked and are investing more than $150 million a year to match the counter prices at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers re-equip stores by adding fast-growing food and news from individuals.
Metcash’s chief executive, Ian Morrice, said the price-fixing and store-equipment programs are catching up and he hopes wholesale sales will return back to basic profitable profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame for his behavior rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a collateral loss in the recent uproar surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise for his behavior rather than criticism, according to Tennis Australia President Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of a talented duo often called "Special Ks," has drawn unwelcome attention for his affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifier in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by a referee, Harrison then declared, "Wawrinka had one to give Kyrgios and I had to give him one too."
While he was last seen crashing a rocket after a convulsion disrupted Richard Gasquet's chances of beating him at the US Open, Kokkinakis steadfastly defended Healy.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, where he is competing with Sam Groth for a second-round spot behind Bernard Romic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Britain.
“I thought quite intensely about the fact that in my opinion Thanasi was a bit involved in the whole dispute,” Healy said.
He destroyed his rocket when he lost because of a convulsion in the U.S., but he's not the first player to vent his frustration on his rocket. I know Thanasi quite well and I can say that he won't be proud of this event.
But he really managed himself very well, because he was exposed to very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so in my opinion he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a fantastic team around him, he also has a great family around him and I think he has been treated a little bit harshly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old man, he works very hard and fits into the team very well and so on, he has never had a problem with other players, he is very respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he is in amazing condition, he is a very stable and mature young boy and I just think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also backed the decision to overlook Kyrgios due to an important match starting on Friday, saying a “mutual decision” was the right solution for everyone but supporting the Canberra native to return to the team as a long-term fixture.
“First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the match and not on all the controversy that has arisen around it [Kyrgyz],” Healy says.
And I think Nick went up very quickly, as Federer and Murray and other people point out, he's growing rapidly in the public eye, he's also made some terrible mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and for a while out of the spotlight, when he's going to be able to think about it, too, in my opinion, is the best for him.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
On Tuesday, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia and detained those who tried to illegally cross it to stem the flow of migrants.
There was chaos on the border, while hundreds of migrants flocked to a no-man's land and Serbian authorities reacted indignantly.
Those who are stuck for an unknown time in the belts of land between two states are those who flee violence in their home countries, build tents and settle down.
But there are feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter flies over them, the migrants together shout "Open the borders!" and denounce the riot police unit of the Hungarian police.
Some are refusing food and water.
Serbia's foreign minister says it was "unacceptable" for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just indirect harm.
In the coming days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to come up with a unified immigration policy at ongoing meetings in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 people seeking protection in surprised Italy and Greece, and spoke with the hope of reaching an agreement next month or at the end of the year that the EU nations would accept more than 120,000 other refugees, including Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday convened a special EU summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
However, Hungary has not pinned its hopes on Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more power to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close roads and speed up court cases of asylum proceedings.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country was also planning to build a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country when the fence on the Serbian border is now complete.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D’Agata reported that even the prisoners were on the list of those who helped pull the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major weakness and entry point to the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants seeking a better life and not war refugees seeking protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now criminalize violations of the 4-meter fence that the government had erected on the southern border with Serbia, and also set longer prison terms for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are quite clear on this: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, parliament still has to approve the military deployment expected next week, but Associated Press reporters have been watching heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs at the border for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban’s domestic defense adviser, said the authorities had caught 45 people who had tried to cross the border and 15 had already been caught on the territory of the state.
They broke through the fence damage and are now in police custody accused of committing offenses under the new laws.
The authorities quickly allowed the fence to be repaired.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a barbed-wire-covered tow truck.
At the main border crossing at Roszke, chaos arose because the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and a crowd of people arose.
About 20 of them went inside, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary, refusing food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
2016 Election: Hillary Clinton’s jump ahead of Bernie Sanders halved in national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is yet to announce whether he wants to become president, is gaining support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main competitions, the most democratic voters claim that it is too early to say that there are clear decisions which candidate they will support.
But Clinton’s sponsors are more confident in their choices than those who support other candidates.
Since last month’s CBS News poll, Clinton has lost ground to several demographic groups, while Sanders has gained several.
Clinton maintains a great lead among women and is easing, but her leadership is narrowing.
Her support among men has decreased significantly, and Sanders is losing only 5 points to her.
Clinton’s advantage with Democratic voters under 50 has evaporated, and now they are on par with Sanders.
But Clinton still has a lot of leadership thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Sanders among the liberals, but now Sanders is losing to her in this group only 5 points.
About half of Democratic primary voters across states say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the party’s candidate.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and a further 15 percent would support her simply because she is a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
It’s probably no surprise that Clinton’s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her.
The views are mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton – only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked in an open question why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by that it’s time for a woman to be president (13 percent), and that she’s the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9%).
Furthermore, there is a great possibility of selection and agreement on problems.
While the vice president is considering a potential presidential bid, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like him to lead — a third think he shouldn’t.
When primary Democratic voters were asked who they would choose as their second choice for party nomination, the most common choice was Biden.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half listed Biden as their second choice, well ahead of Sanders.
If Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton’s leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden runs, to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that number has fallen from 78 percent last month.
Biden is by far second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as most likely to be elected is increasing.
However, when it comes to the question of the greater importance of the candidate, democratic voters prefer to solve problems over a greater chance of being elected.
Like last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, perform well in some key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Most see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as sincere and trustworthy, and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Of the three, Biden leads in sincerity, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don’t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don’t.
Primary Democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders, and Biden are in line with their ideological view.
On all these measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton’s decision to use her personal email and server as secretary of state continue, most of the Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say their overall view of her has not affected her at all.
But among the American public, it's a whole different story.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on the issue was already divided in March, shortly after the issue was revealed.
The majority of Americans say that this email controversy has no impact on their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent said their opinion of Clinton has worsened.
More than six in 10 Republicans say their views on Clinton have worsened.
Even though Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy among her party’s voters, the issue is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month, and 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not think they are honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not see Trump as honest and trustworthy either.
But both Clinton and Trump have good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush were the most honest.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, like Carson, a lot of voters didn’t take a stand on him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson lost to Donald Trump in the national election.
Ben Carson moves closer to Donald Trump in latest CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest poll, and the others are asking for support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump with an overwhelming majority, climbing from 23% in the last CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson shot from 6 percent to 23 percent in the same period.
The poll also found Carson doing well across demographic groups, and ranked Trump among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorin and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, is behind Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker completely on the run from 10% support to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest poll is plus or minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson improved to 19% among Republicans behind Trump’s 32% support.
The latest poll from ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is well ahead of Carson.
With Carson’s rising trend, Trump has decided to fire a blind shot at a retired neurosurgeon, and even Carson has apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Five Brotherhood members charged with death of first-year Baruch College student
Nearly two years after the student died during an overloaded fraternal ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and took him to the hospital late, contributing to his death, police said.
Police said he was blindfolded, had a backpack full of sand weighing 30 pounds and was repeatedly harassed as he tried to reach the target through a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then passed out.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 immediately after Deng passed out and reportedly waited an hour before being taken to hospital, police said.
However, they found time to change Deng’s clothes, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the Brotherhood’s national president, and ask him for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
“At this point, the members began to hide the equipment and basically preferred the well-being of the fraternity to the life of Michael Deng,” Wagner said.
He was unable to revive him and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck with a blunt object in the head, torso and thighs.
“Too many families have been devastated by fraternal overwork, and at least one student has died each year from overwork since 1970,” Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng’s family, wrote in a statement.
The Brotherhood and its members must be held accountable, and this step is important on the part of the authorities.
The grand jury of Monroe County recommended third-degree murder charges for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with aggravated assault and criminal association.
"We want to hold not only the individuals involved, but if there is an organization that has approved it, either officially or unofficially, we will hold them accountable as well," Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College forbade fraternities, and the National Fraternities severed their relationship with the local branches.
This is what happens when the Fed raises interest rates.
Interest rates will rise and the bull market will falter, bond yields will rise and the economy will slide into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how long it will take and how long it will take.
For the economy in particular, the history of the small originator offers about timing.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness in raising rates is often, though not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
That’s why U.S. central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when rate hikes begin, but rather on the trajectory of how long normalization will take.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that all the fuss due to the increase in speed can be exaggerated.
“The Fed’s first rise since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the era of ‘cheap money,’” Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
On the other hand, we do not expect that the gradual return of US interest rates to a more normal but still low level will create a seismic shock that many might fear.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here’s a look at how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has recorded over the last about a month, the expected rate hikes may make the air a bit volatile.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
“There seems to be a trend to stop stocks again 12-24 months after the first hike, which again may reflect a delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hike.
More specifically, the market over the past roughly 35 years has often been most – about 14 percent – headed for rate increases in relatively flat 250 days (an average gain of 2.6 percent) and then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return from the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief stock strategist at Management Nuen.
Deutsche said the impact on equities tends to become more pronounced later in the rate-raising cycle and returns are starting to decline.
A recession is a fact of economic life, but rising rates often help it.
Currently, the Fed faces some conditions that did not yet exist and that could hasten the recession.
The most notable is that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in history when the Fed’s rates rise.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the 118 rate hikes since 1950, the nominal year-on-year increase in GDP was just under 4.5 percent.
Despite the fact that in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6 percent, few expect to maintain it, when in the third quarter it was only 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates in this complex economic background could be risky, and the question could arise “whether this time is different,” Deutsche said.
Market participants were ready for the Fed’s growth year-round, and all eyes turned to a meeting of the Federal Free Market Committee, which took place this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve the increase at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25 percent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all the upswing cycles so far have been in a super-upswing cycle with GDP covering the peaks of the early recession very quickly after the beginning of the recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery since the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, we are now at 74 months, and we are still going on.
The fixed yield was also volatile, as the market expects rates to rise and the pattern is somewhat similar to what stocks experience.
The main difference is that the impact is more quickly seen in bonds than stocks when the Fed changes course.
For bonds, yields appear to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the up/down cycle.
At the end of the cycle, bond yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that the rate hikes will cause a convergence of yields between long- and short-dated bonds, which equals the curve.
High-yield bonds often perform better in this climate, though “we are still wary of yield strains,” Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, said in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks that the markets are already adjusted to the Fed’s policy expectations.
“Besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the outlook for a tighter monetary policy,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are at the top, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened, and volatility has increased — all market characteristics as the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, companies that conduct most of their business in the US will win after the interest rate rises, and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt will fare worse because the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt will also be larger.
“History shows that the ‘quality’ of stocks tends to outperform within three months of the initial rate hike,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets overtook weak balance sheets companies in each interest rate increase in 1994, 1999, 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital, as well as stocks with low volatility, also outperformed their lower-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt will become a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of floating interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
In addition to purely stock games, consumers are also benefiting from the rising dollar.
Savers can also see their profits through higher returns, but experts have different opinions on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised the station for "fooling"
He feels that he is becoming more and more indistinguishable from his commercial rival.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says they are simply cheating the British.
Member of Parliament Damien Collins attacked the Voice and says even he is not an original idea
BBC Radio 3 is “changing” into Classic FM, a leading MP says, accumulating fresh pressure on the broadcast to prove they are doing something commercial broadcasts don’t.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC's bosses that the public service radio station appeared to be "fooled" and was becoming more indistinguishable from its business rival.
“Radio 3 seems to be — I don’t like to use the word ‘fooled’ — but it seems to be turning into Classic FM,” he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, seems to be a different name for the British.
So if you’re trying to do something different — these are two examples that come to mind where you’re actually just imitating what we already have on the market,” Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC’s director-general rejected the allegations, saying BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its business rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I would not have learned on any other radio.
And their commitment to live music and make music is actually top-notch.
“I also think Radio 3’s commitment to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important,” he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to engage the audience than before, because the British are less educated when it comes to classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC production element to come under fire for trampling on the heels of commercial competitors during the broadcasts of Culture, Media and Sport and got to the hearings of the commission.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a music talent show the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you see why this program is discussed as non-original and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show – in which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George shine as judges – was produced “in a manner typical of the BBC.”
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from its own stable" the next time it launches a fun series.
However, he declined to rule out ordering more future series of The Voice or spending taxpayer money on other entertainment formats.
Online sales are growing at the slowest pace since August, and Black Friday may be to blame
The first three months of 2015 saw a 7% increase in online sales.
Last month saw the lowest growth since records began in 2000.
Online sales were boosted three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that November’s Black Friday could be the reason for the slowdown in spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise, turning many of Britain’s main streets into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are signs of steady online sales, and the new figures show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditures for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the year 2000, with an increase of only 5 percent compared to last year.
Experts say there are signs of steady online sales, and the new figures show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
“When you look at the growth rate of the past years and go back to the year 2000, it has always rationalized over time,” Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explains that online sales were boosted three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that people were able to shop online and were able to make purchases in a variety of contexts, such as on a sofa.
But now (growth) is somewhat stagnant, and therefore it seems to be fading away.
The phenomenon of Black Friday, which was taken from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers could refrain from shopping ahead of this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
In the past year, five times the average of shoppers turned to their computers to make purchases while downgrading a number of retailer websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which buyers negotiate again, can deter customers from further purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only <0xC2><0xA3>1 out of every <0xC2><0xA3>5 was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion stores.
Muslims buried victims of crane collapse in Mecca, Bin Laden family sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead were carried through the streets by Muslims at the first funeral in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia is partly to blame for the collapse of design tycoon Saudi Binladin Group.
The health ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims of the fall of the crane in the Grand Mosque in Mecca, carrying the bodies of the victims along the street.
Dressed to some extent in white, the mourners chose the path and paid homage to the victims when the first of the fallen made his final journey to the cemetery at Al-Moaissem.
The sad message passed around the holy place, where just a few days earlier the construction crane had broken through the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the faithful.
The bodies were released for burial and the Saudi king sanctioned the bin Laden family’s construction group over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 dead after the fall of a crane in the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will take place and thousands of people continue to descend into the city.
King Salman said today that the Binadin Group should not have left the crane arm up when it was not in operation.
The Arab version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said Binladin Group was partly to blame for the crash.
The English service of the disk agency did not report this detail, but said that the company's bosses were prohibited from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims converge before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not issued a statement on the collapse of the crane and its representatives have not been made available for comment.
The royal decrees also accused the group of failing to use the latest security measures, and of failing to coordinate with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, part of a massive construction effort led by Binladin Group.
Binladin’s family has been close to Saudi Arabia’s ruling family for decades and run large construction projects.
The late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was the son of a renegade family who gave up on him in the 1990s.
The crash took place amid strong winds and rain just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom on a pilgrimage that every able-bodied Muslim must complete at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people remain in hospital.
Officials have determined that one million riyals (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) will be given to relatives of the killed, and the same amount for the permanently injured.
Other injuries will receive half of this amount.
B&Q CEO Says Eastern European Traders Working Cheaply Are Already Trending
Britons are increasingly hiring artisans, according to Veronique Laury
The number of trained traders from Eastern Europe is behind the growth point
The result is an open 200 Screwfix stores aimed at traders
Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
Edited by Rupert Steiner, chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are reported to be laying down hammers and brushes and handing them over to busy, trained Eastern European craftsmen to work at their home.
If you’re good with a hammer or paintbrush, you seem to be in the minority today.
Because the British are increasingly hiring artisans to do the DIY work at home, according to the company’s CEO behind Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns the home supply chain, says that the large increase in the number of trained Eastern European traders offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores targeting merchants, and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms. Laury says she wants to hire more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store make a better half.
Currently, most of the workers are male.
She said there is a need to address the growing demographic trends that show more women’s households making more home improvements than in the past.
Mrs. Laury says, "There are still mostly men working in our shops.
We need to get closer to balance.
In fact, half of our customers are women, who make 80% of purchasing decisions.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process.
Laura, one of only five women at the helm of the FTSE100, has also restructured her top-notch team to reflect equality between male and female CEOs.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in having half the representation of women among its employees, including its executive and chief financial officer.
Laura says: "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
So it was not difficult to find good women to take to us.
Kingfisher reported a decline in both profits in the middle of the year and sales after the group took on the costs of closing stores.
Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is opening 200 new stores
The December contribution of CZK 600 to pensioners is at risk.
"It is the justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Miroslav Kalousek, vice-chairman of TOP 09, who stressed the principle of merit.
ODS Speaker Zbyn<0xC4><0x9B>k Stanjura noted that a one-time contribution sounds good, but in the long run it would be better to be in standard valorization, as it would be reflected in the coming years.
"We have the space to find the mechanism by which we will arrange it," Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal of Minister Michaela Marksová (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), according to which next year it should be valorized beyond the law.
Marx defended the subsidy by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she said was not rosy.
According to her, a higher valuation next year would mean a budget impact of 5.5 billion crowns, and ministers are debating each hundred million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) reminded the right that in the past, the pace of valorization has decreased.
Rapporteur Miroslav Opálka (KS<0xC4><0x8C>M) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
The veto of the right-wing paycheck in December will significantly complicate and perhaps even make it impossible, he said.
The chairman of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD deputies, Roman Sklenák, therefore proposed shortening the deadline for discussing the norm in the committee to ten or 20 days, even the right blocked it.
The committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should cost a total of CZK 1.73 billion.
The money should come mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
Next year, pensions should increase by about a hundred crowns on average.
The contribution should be received according to the pension amendment by people who will be entitled to a pension or part of it in December.
It could also be obtained by those who lost their right to a pension in December before its payment.
However, they would have to apply for the surcharge in writing, at the latest by the end of next year.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are valorized regularly by January, namely by price growth and a third of real wage growth.
This year, the pension corresponds to 41.5 percent of gross wage, next year it should be 40.5 percent.
According to the state final account, the state spent CZK 314.7 billion on old-age pensions last year, which was about five billion more year-on-year.
Expenditure on old-age pensions accounted for 26 percent of all budget expenditure and 46 percent of all statutory expenditure.
The average full old-age pension last year increased by 104 to 10,714 crowns, according to the data in the state final account.
The Czech Social Security Administration ensured the payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and about 17,000 proportional pensions.
Yakunin has abandoned plans for a political career, he will devote himself to science.
According to the Russian media, the billionaire was almost certain to hold the Senate seat.
In the Federation Council he was supposed to represent the West-Russian Kaliningrad region, whose governor Nikolai Tsukanov, as a candidate of the ruling United Russia party, defended his post in Sunday's elections with a review.
According to Russian law, senators are not elected by citizens, but are chosen by the governor from among three candidates whose names they announce before the gubernatorial elections.
After the election, the senator from the three candidates will choose himself.
The complication for Yakunin was the fact that he had not lived in the Kaliningrad region for twenty years, as required by law.
The Kremlin has found an exception for Yakunin, although he is an extraordinary and authorized ambassador, who is not subject to the legal requirement of long-term residence.
The filming of the Czech comedy The Theory of the Tiger is over.
The final straw in the main character’s decision is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who has run out of strength and patience.
Grandmother - Iva Jan<0xC5><0xBE>urová made decisions about her grandfather's life, age and funeral.
It is clear to Jan that he is on a similar path with his wife Olga - Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Balzerová.
He remembers that once he had his own will and dreams, he wants to live with dignity and freedom.
He longs to regain control of his life - and chooses to escape from the past as a solution, Slav<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
Bajgar wanted to capture in a comedic form a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the main role would be given to Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ek, with whom he had already collaborated on the series Invisible.
However, the actor, who appeared in front of the camera after a long break associated with convalescence after a serious illness, surprised him.
We made a deal three years ago.
I had him read the script and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I'm surprised he's obviously a dorky athlete.
In the past, he always asked where he would sit before shooting the next scene.
This time he rode his bike, climbed rocks and even walked uphill.
And all this in record-breaking tropical heat, the director said.
According to Bartoszka, women take a tiger to turn it into a rabbit over time.
They'll pour him some food, but they'll close the door right away so he doesn't have to think about playing the tiger outside the rabbit house.
And that’s what we’re trying to tell our film about, the actor commented.
His wife, who may have a slightly negative effect on the audience, was portrayed by Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Balzerová.
She's not just a negative character.
She is also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic and thinks well.
But she is also a usurper and wants to roast her husband to death, Bajgar said.
The film also depicts the fates of Jan's married daughters Olinka and Alenka - Tá<0xC5><0x88>a Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová - and sons-in-law Erik and Pep<0xC3><0xAD>k - Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The producer of the film is Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google has pledged millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
Google has pledged to provide an additional $5.5 million to organizations that help thousands of refugees entering Europe.
It was announced on Tuesday by Google.org, a charitable arm of the internet company.
Azerbaijan cancelled Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ek’s part of the visit for criticizing human rights violations.
Pavel Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, a Czech MEP for the ANO movement, postponed his planned trip to Baku on Thursday because the Azerbaijani authorities cancelled the official part of his visit today.
According to Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, this is justified by last week’s resolution of the European Parliament, which criticizes human rights violations in Azerbaijan and of which Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka was a co-author.
By the decision of the Azerbaijani party, Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka lost the opportunity to talk with official partners and also to visit political prisoners, which depends on the consent of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press statement.
Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka wanted to use the trip, which was planned several months in advance, to meet with the leadership of the parliament and representatives of the executive branch, as well as with representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, the text sent to the Czech News Agency said.
The resolution condemns "unprecedented repressions against civil society in Azerbaijan".
It called on European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after the recent conviction of Azerbaijani opposition journalist Khadija Ismailova, who campaigned for the detection of corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out the possibility of building an air base in Syria.
Bogdanovsky did not rule out the possibility of a Russian air base in Syria in the future.
We don't have such plans yet.
Nothing is excluded, he said.
Russia already has a naval base in Syria in the port of Tartus, which has so far been used as a service and logistics center.
According to Russian press reports, however, since the beginning of August, supplies of Russian weapons and military material to Syria have increased.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from valid trade agreements.
The Pentagon says the Russians are planning to establish an air base near the city of Latakia, which remains a bastion of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for now.
Washington, however, is not entirely clear about Russia’s specific military intentions in Syria, U.S. commentators agree.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov on Tuesday, the third phone call in a decade.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Moscow next week to explain concerns over the build-up of Russia’s arsenal near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called Moscow’s support for Assad a lost bet.
He said Russia’s policy goals in Syria were unclear.
Moscow has turned Syria into a satellite.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a long-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, is not entirely clear.
The war in Syria is to be the main topic of Putin’s speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York, according to today’s Russian press speculation.
On the other hand, the Russian leader is not going to talk about the situation in the Ukrainian Donbass.
According to a report in The New York Times, the U.S. government does not rule out that President Barack Obama could meet with the Russian president during a U.N. meeting.
Opinions among White House advisers have so far diverged.
TASS news agency today, citing the words of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, wrote that Putin has not yet met with Obama on the program of his New York stay.
Put sesame oil on the gallbladder diet, hemp helps strengthen immunity.
A good way to increase the intake of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is the use of extra virgin oils.
When pressed from seeds in cold, all healthy substances remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, for example, gallbladder.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, they have been the most common cause of death for Czechs for several years.
Gallbladder inflammation mainly affects women, sesame oil helps.
If you are one of the lovers of Asian cuisine, you should not miss the sesame oil in your pantry, which is part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the heat treatment of dishes and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in the gallbladder diet.
The essential fatty acids it contains are a good prevention of gallstone formation.
These are 90% of the cause of gallbladder inflammation, and women suffer from these problems 3 times more often than men.
In general, gallbladder problems mainly concern overweight people who do not exercise and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can be successfully used in the liver diet, which is very similar to the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits of consuming this oil, they should be wary of goods from exotic food stores.
Manufacturers from Asia often use over-roasted seeds for pressing, which have a more pronounced taste.
But the oil will lose all the active substances, described Ladislav Ha<0xC4><0x8D>eck<0xC3><0xBD>, executive director of the Czech company Bohemia Oljej z Kraslice na Sokolovsko, which produces bio virgin oils pressed cold.
The company also newly produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unroasted white sesame seeds.
In an hour, our press can press 8 kilos of sesame.
By mechanical pressing, the raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for the designation of extra virgin.
At higher temperatures, nutrients would be lost.
Sunflower oil is beneficial for diseases of the heart and blood vessels.
The Czech favorite among oils is sunflower.
The research of Jarmila Hamerská, who led at Masaryk University, showed that 43% of respondents prefer it in a warm kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for frying, as it starts to burn at 180 °C.
It is better to use it, for example, to season salads and it is especially useful in the diet, in which it helps in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which, of all fatty acids, reduce cholesterol levels the most.
For heart problems, you need to pay attention to the amount of total fat and calories consumed.
For example, in one tablespoon of sunflower oil there are 62 calories, in a tablespoon of rapeseed oil there are 99 calories.
When it comes to the energy value of food, it is important to remember that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
Therefore, it is advisable to use extra virgin oils.
The sunflower will last the same as sesame and hemp for 9 months.
Storage in the refrigerator will extend the shelf life even longer.
Old oil is known to people especially by its bitter taste.
On the contrary, there is no turbidity at the bottom of the fault.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
Seeds of technical hemp are classified as so-called superfoods, and therefore hemp oil is considered the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This designation is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot be produced by the body itself and must be taken from food.
Especially important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
A study published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, while Icelanders consume 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil should be included in the diet as part of a supportive diet to strengthen immunity and heal wounds.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People do not have to worry about the use of hemp oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers is confirmed by the fact that it is one of the best-selling oils at Bohemia Oil.
It is sold 500 liters per year.
People often take one tablespoon on an empty stomach in the morning.
Hemp oil is not in any way pronounced, but it will greatly strengthen the immune system, advised Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek from the company Bohemia Olej.
According to statistics, the most passionate nation of grillers are Americans.
For every household there is 1.4 grills.
Around the world there are various competitions in grilling, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
There are no Czechs in the back.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people have not grilled in their lives.
The vast majority of them also grill several times a year.
In order for grilling to be successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to adjust the meat by marinating a few hours before heat treatment.
Which oil is the most suitable for this and at the same time retains healthy substances when grilling?
In general, fat should be saved during the grilling process itself.
Experts agree that a large proportion of oils begin to lose their flavor at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils also lose the body’s beneficial substances, which we otherwise get from them when consuming oils from foods prepared at lower temperatures.
But this does not mean that extra virgin oils will not find their application when grilling.
Grape oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When you say meat, experts from the company Bohemia Oil from Kraslice in the Sokolov region immediately recall grape oil.
It perfectly complements the taste of meat and fish.
The kitchen is characterized by a unique feature of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling, as it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Even at this high temperature, Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek from Bohemia Olje describes the benefits of grape oil as one of the few Czech producers of this grape oil.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains a high amount of linoleic acid, and is therefore effective in combating excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also receives important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the favorable content of these substances, it helps to reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming grape oil, we also help to increase our external beauty - it improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps in the care of dry and brittle hair.
Chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
Not only is it suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example, when seasoning salads, but also for the heat treatment of dishes.
When grilling can be used in two ways, when marinating and grilling.
By marinating meat and fish, we will preserve their juiciness.
When preparing the marinade, three components must be present: oil, acidity and spices.
For example, we add sourness with apple cider vinegar to soften the meat.
Spices, in turn, give the meat a taste and preserve the oil and give the right cut, advises Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
At the same time, he adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating because it is one of the few oils that can pass through dark meat.
Marinated meat or fish are ready for grilling, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that they only need a few drops to prepare dishes.
The same goes for grilling.
Some oils are completely taboo for this method of preparation.
This is especially true of linseed, hemp and rapeseed oils, which should not be heated at all.
Before grilling, grease the grill with oil to prevent the food from burning.
An essential part of grilling is also the preparation of attachments.
Grilled meat and fish are suitable for almost anything - grilled vegetables, toasted bread, light vegetable salad and many others.
Chefs from Bohemia Olje recommend Hot Summer salad, for example.
For it you need: • 1 piece of peaches • 1 bunch of arugula • 1 cup of chopped cucumbers • 1 cup of a mixture of salad leaves • 3 tablespoons of grape oil
In a salad bowl, add the chopped arugula, cucumbers and peaches to the salad leaf mixture.
Salt and pepper to taste, you can also season with ground chilli and soy sauce.
Finally, drip a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can then sprinkle the salad with finely chopped almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: it is not only the drugs that matter, but also the patient’s will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease, and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of specialists: a neurologist, a physiotherapist, an occupational therapist, a urologist, an ophthalmologist, a psychologist, a psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only about medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis also need consultations, if they decide to have a child, the care of these patients includes social and legal advice, recommendations for the adjustment of housing, etc.
Yet all this is not enough: the development of the disease can significantly affect the patient himself.
The more he actively fights the disease, the longer he can work and does not have to fundamentally change his lifestyle.
As doctors point out, the passivity of patients frees up space for the activity of the disease.
For example, regular exercise has been shown to significantly delay the time the patient needs some kind of compensatory aid, such as a staff.
It is important that patients and their surroundings are not subject to various myths, for example, that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
That is why we created the Give Yourself a Chance page (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give Yourself a Chance.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
With multiple sclerosis, it is said twice that the sooner the disease is treated, the more likely the doctor can influence something.
This is because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis in the inflammatory stage, when the process of neurodegeneration is not yet so strong.
The sooner we intervene, the greater the hope that we will be able to stop the disease and delay the disability, explains Dr. Eva Medová from the Neurology Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with multiple sclerosis rehabilitation care, which most often addresses the weakening of the lower limbs or balance disorders.
Patients are treated according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthen the pelvic floor, relieve swallowing disorders or improve coordination.
"It's really individual, it depends on the specific difficulties of the patient," says MUDr. Martina K<0xC3><0xB6>vári, head of the Department of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine at the University Hospital in Motol.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it manifests itself in a slightly different way for everyone.
Rehabilitation can not stop the disease, but it can always relieve its symptoms.
However, physical activity also strengthens the immune state of the body, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive of regular exercise is the fact that the sick check what they can do, and this strengthens their self-confidence.
"Endorphins are also flushed out during exercise and one feels good after it," notes PhDr. Kamila <0xC5><0x98>asová from the Clinic of Rehabilitation Medicine of the University Hospital of Královské Vinohrady.
By influencing the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
This directly interferes with the psyche and immune processes and stabilizes the disease, he adds.
"Previously, these patients were so-called savings, today we know that they need a targeted load," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolá<0xC5><0x99>, head of the Department of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine at the Motol University Hospital.
The goal of physiotherapy is that a person can remain self-sufficient for as long as possible, including work placement.
Therefore, physiotherapists work with occupational therapists to ensure that each person receives a compensation aid tailored to them.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They are in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, most people shake it up.
They experience shock, panic, fear.
They must respond to a great burden - loss of health.
With such a sore soul, we have to go to someone, not try to bear everything on our own shoulders.
"I work with them to finally come to the conclusion that even with a disability you can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová-Schubertová from the Neurology Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague-based manufacturer Latecoere, Airbuses would not fly.
Aviation production is synonymous with precision and advanced technologies.
The new aircraft are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials, which someone can not produce and process.
Nevertheless, in addition to super-precise, computer-controlled machine tools, in addition to autoclaves for shaping composites, you can come across something as ordinary as apricot seeds.
In the drum, which resembles a cotton candy pot, the edges of the sheet metal parts that have just come out of the milling machine are tumbling in a pile of stones.
"So far, no one has come up with anything better," smiles Ivan Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>, CEO of aircraft door manufacturer Latecoere Czech Republic.
In Let<0xC5><0x88>any, Prague, the former Letov produces complete doors for the Airbus A320.
They are the only ones in the world to supply doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors, part of which are being assembled in Prague, are also used by passengers in the first and higher class on the upper decks of the world’s largest passenger aircraft Airbus A380.
A door full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner is also being installed here.
Accuracy is the main motto here.
For example, the company allows the torque wrenches to be adjusted twice a year.
If the yellow sticker was missing a record of the inspection, they should explain at the Prague plant what to do to the auditors from Airbus or Boeing, who regularly go to check whether the doors are manufactured according to the agreed rules.
But advanced technology has not yet completely replaced the human senses.
There are 1500 rivets on one door to the A320.
These must be hand-knocked by the riveters.
It takes them two days.
Even by the sound of the hammer falling, they will know if the rivet is already correctly tapped.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The rivet can rise above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 millimeters.
This is about twice the thickness of a human hair.
During the inspection, a trained touch will come to the fore.
When the inspector runs his finger over a row of rivets, he knows if any are out of tolerance.
Then he picks up the exact skewer.
Letov fueled the program of the L-39 military trainer aircraft before 1989.
But in 1991 not one of them was made.
The company had to find new jobs quickly.
At the time, it partnered with European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won the tender for the supplier of emergency doors for the A321 model.
The negotiations with Boeing were not so successful.
“We were a small company for them back then, and they didn’t have enough money to invest and to guarantee Boeing stable long-term deliveries,” Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> recalls.
The door to the American manufacturer would remain locked if Letov did not attract the French Latecoere group at the Prague conference of the international association of the aviation industry in 1999.
We talked about our partnership with Airbus.
The next day, negotiations started with the French, Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> says.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company and with a strong company came new orders.
In 2000, the assembly of door parts for the A320 began.
Three years later, the top deck doors for the A380 were added.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing facility to supply the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we wouldn't have been able to get to these big jobs on our own.
Maybe we could make parts or small parts.
Partners want a supply guarantee for twenty or thirty years, Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> explains.
Last year, the Czech Latecoere achieved a turnover of over 2.9 billion and a profit after tax of 147 million crowns.
The exclusive position among the suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere has invested CZK 1.5 billion in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, certification of 170 special production processes and certificates of qualification for key employees.
Without them, the company would not have produced any aircraft doors.
According to Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>, it costs millions of crowns to obtain certificates that the production processes meet the requirements of customers, and to keep them in repeated inspections.
Production processes change every year.
They are more precise and strict.
We need to train employees, retrofit the equipment and re-certify the entire process, Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> adds.
Now the company is completing the process of zinc and nickel plating, which will replace the harmful cadmium for human health.
They received the order from the manufacturer, but then they had to adapt the technology for the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
The people from Boeing will come, they will check the concept of the entire line.
Then we show them the production.
They'll also check our lab.
They test one set of samples themselves in their laboratory and then compare the results with ours, Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> explains the way customers check them.
The reward is long-term exclusive contracts for the Prague company.
With the Prague plant today stands and falls the production of embryos.
For the A320, it produces half of the total door volume.
Replacing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European manufacturer.
But that doesn’t mean you can’t get a price on the door.
The contract includes a price curve.
It indicates how much one door will cost for ten, fifty, one hundred pieces made.
The price per piece is still falling to a certain limit value.
We have to fit into this price pattern.
If not, we will lose, says Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Half of the hall where the electric cabinets for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft are assembled is still empty.
It is a symbol of the future.
Behind the curtain, a new semi-robotic riveting and door assembly line is being built for the innovative A320 Neo.
The riveting will speed up and refine.
"This is the trend that aviation assembly is heading towards," Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> adds.
The sale has a future line secured.
Airbus has announced that it has ordered 3,278 A320s.
Just a few meters away, a line will be created for the complete installation of the door for the upper deck of the A380.
This is a strategic decision of our parent company.
The goal is to reduce production times and costs.
Full assembly could begin in two years, Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> says.
Before that, however, the company must pass qualification tests for the installation of some electrical and electronic equipment in the doors for the largest Airbus.
The company also focuses on the further development of production from composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it is expected to participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"It is a huge credit for the company when it can process composites in addition to metal materials," Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> says proudly.
Latecoere, however, is getting to the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
In the area of Letov, where he is based, there is no other place.
Before the entry of the French mother, the company had 180 employees.
Now there are 800 of them, and in three years there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing compete over how many hundreds of new planes the airlines order each year, they don’t have to worry about the job.
Despite having contracts for several years ahead, the Prague-based parent company Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money for the September loan repayments.
In the end, Latecoere was able to negotiate with the major creditors.
At the end of August, they exchanged part of their loans for shares.
The creditors gained a share of 37.4 percent in the company by raising capital by EUR 57.4 million.
The company’s debt fell by two-thirds, or <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>180 million.
The second part of the financial recovery came in early September.
The company has signed up new shares for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222.9 million among its existing shareholders.
In total, it raised the capital by EUR 280 million.
The entire group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which account for 85 percent of sales.
The average contract growth is expected to be four percent per year until 2017.
In the order book, he has orders for 2.6 billion euros, which corresponds to four years of production.
French media say Latecoere can finally breathe again after years of dripping.
The Czech race in Let<0xC5><0x88>any in Prague is important for the groups.
It contributes 16 percent to the group’s revenue.
According to the number of employees, it is the largest foreign branch of the group.
MEPs backed a larger share of the state from coal levies.
The change in mining fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the state treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenues of the municipalities are supposed to have a neutral impact, because the fee is supposed to be higher.
Last year, municipalities received about 450 million crowns from fees and the state budget received 150 million crowns.
From the extraction of brown coal, about 200 million crowns went to the municipalities and 66 million crowns to the state.
The amendment also envisages an increase in the payment from mining areas with permitted extraction to CZK 1,000 per hectare per year.
The income from these payments should continue to belong in full to the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) told MPs that thanks to this, municipalities will receive CZK 14 million to CZK 100 million per year instead.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but determined by the government by its regulation.
The remuneration shall be newly calculated as a product of the amount of mineral extracted and the rate for each type of mineral.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
ODS MP Marek Benda, however, warned that setting the fee by government decree may not be in line with the constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, it is not a tax in this case, because the state charges for the mineral, which is state property.
Fees are only received by municipalities whose territories are affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three-quarters of the municipality's money and a quarter of the state's.
The same will be the case in the case of the extraction of radioactive rocks.
Part of the money that the state will collect on mining fees will be purpose-bound.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide a mine rescue service.
The draft was criticized by opposition MPs who claimed that it would damage the villages and regions affected by the mining.
For example, Michal Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era (TOP 09 and the Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just so that the Minister of Finance improves his budget," said David Kádner (Dawn) elected in the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem Region.
Hana Aulická, a member of the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M, warned about the increase in unemployment in Mostecko.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era wanted to return the law to the government for completion.
The explanatory note states that, according to mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, since prices are more than 90 percent long-term contracted.
Major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should therefore not feel the price increase.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in payments by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
According to her, however, the increase in fees in terms of employment is bearable.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment, Milan Urban (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), it is crucial that the MPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on the limits of coal mining even before the law is approved.
If coal is also extracted beyond the limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czechoslovak Army should be made only after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the bottom of the CSA should be broken already for social, economic reasons and because of the long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.
Time to Decide on Interest Rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve prepares to meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists approached by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they will remain inactive for some time and keep interest rates in the range of 0.25%.
It’s a historic event because it’s been years since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank could be able to get off the ground and start the process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has performed fairly well, recovering by adding trillions of dollars to the national account and creating only low levels of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy global perspective.
They warned the markets to be prepared for an increase, but circumstances suggest they also see great chances against this move.
The decision is to be announced on Thursday at 20:00 CET.
A gunman at Delta State University left a message.
Shannon Lamb, who shot and killed his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday — and later the same day his colleague — wrote a note saying he was “sorry” for the first murders and that he wished he could take it back, government officials revealed on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a geography and social science teacher at Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning around 10 a.m.
He said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send officers to his house.
He said, “I shot my wife last night” and also mentioned that there is a “cute dog” in the house who “will not bother anyone” but is upset.
The police demanded the name of the caller, but Lamb did not introduce himself.
Lamb also did not explain why the house was shot.
When police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message from Lamb, which read: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she’s the only person who’s ever loved me.”
After leaving a message, Lamb made the 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
University dean William LaForge said he did not know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "there was clearly something going on in Mr. Lamb's head."
Despite Monday’s announcement that Lamb believed in Amy Prentiss’s romantic relationship with Schmidt, government officials said there was “no evidence” of a “love triangle.”
Shawn O'Steen, who has been married to Prentiss for more than seven years, said she was a "great person".
The divorce happened 15 years ago, but they both remained friends.
O'Steen and Prentiss' 19-year-old daughter was "shocked" by the case.
O’Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were “best friends.”
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as reported by the Sun Herald, Prentiss worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, had dated Lamb for about three years.
"She's always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he was "not going to jail".
When officers caught up with him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled into the woods, where he shot himself.
According to the curriculum vitae he published on the school’s website, Lamb received his PhD in Education from Delta University in the spring of 2015.
The Stars Who Lost Their Magic
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had several stressful years.
He battled leukemia in 2001 and lost his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer in 2009.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem and was arrested for drug possession in 2008.
All of these things are certainly taking their toll.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United will be out of the game for a few months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double right leg fracture during Manchester United's defeat in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left-back left this injury in tears and put him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
Injury was caused by the reckless intervention of Héctor Moren in the 15th minute, when the 20-year-old Shaw penetrated into the PSV space.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and an oxygen mask was needed before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He suffered a double leg fracture and is now in hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after tomorrow and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester at 18 has it very hard, but he plays fantastic and then this happens.
When he was in the dressing rooms, he was also wearing an oxygen mask.
Crying.
I am not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and will not be able to play in the group stage.
I think he will play again this season.
Moreno was lucky not to get a red card and a penalty kick.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall hinted that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ugly operation with both feet.
A tweet from Shaw’s account says, “Thank you all for their messages, words cannot express how devastated I am, my journey to recovery begins now and I will come back even stronger.”
Manchester United record injury to Luke Shaw in defeat to PSV
The English defender will have added motivation to recover in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: “It was a very ugly injury.”
When any player leaves the field with such an injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the goal of our players to hurt their opponents.
Moreno suffered a broken leg during a match for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
“It’s very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt an opponent, and when you hear about the severity of such an injury, it’s not good,” Cocu said.
I was not able to see this moment.
I only saw the ball going in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it, but I didn’t see the intervention on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after Chris Smalling's surgery.
Does David Cameron know the Lorax better?
Every parent knows this: when a child falls in love with a book, it doesn’t take long to learn it almost by heart.
You can't be David Cameron.
Asked by a children’s schematics provider to name a favorite children’s book, Prime Minister Lorax chose a fairy tale by Dr. Seuss from 1971.
It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in a report posted on SuperCamps’ website, and goes on: “Funny, touching, creative and with strong content, that’s the kind I loved reading to my kids because there was always an image or message behind it that I hadn’t seen before.”
Well, only then, in the following paragraph, Cameron reportedly described the plot of the book according to an elevator from a 2012 film that added more characters and details to fill in a brief original text.
"In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," is the brief content of the book, which records the object of love unknown to Dr. Seuss, whose true name was Seuss.
As if that wasn’t suspicious enough, the text delivered by Cameron reads like a summary of the film Lorax, which is found on the Internet Movie Database website, and begins with the words: “In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the hearts of his children.”
Since he was an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not have become acquainted with the plot of the book, where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is being devastated by the predatory, tree-cutting industrialist Once-ler, who despite the protests of the titular Lorax, the truncated, writhing tree, "speaks for"
Most likely, such a relatively insignificant PR task was given to a helper who had never read Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokesman said the text likely came from Cameron’s supporters’ office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by an employee of Cameron, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of being forgotten by England, but he still holds
Competing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the team England have chosen for this tour, I think a repeat of the 3-0 defeat they suffered last season in the test series is not very likely.
I wouldn't rule out guest wins either.
Alastair Cook’s side may be less experienced than that of three years ago, but there are good spin players in this batting line-up and also the collective mindset is strong; they will not bear the scars of 2012, only the youthful positivity.
With the ball is Moeen Ali's developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the level of the test series, represents an attacking option.
Adam Lyth dropped out of England in the experienced series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth behind is a tough one for me to analyse because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests stood against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are judged on performance.
For example, there were no question marks around the name Joe Root, which led to the announcement, because — and I’ve said this before — players are their best selectors.
A few more half-century and Lyth could extend his run, but he had control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The England manager, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, although his performances were not 100%, and that is not surprising to me; he was always a team player.
The question of how much trial time a batsman gets to show up is a hard one.
Lyth got seven caps — just like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and out.
The only thing you could complain about is that England gave Jonathan Trott a chance in the Caribbean at first — even though Lyth was in the best shape — but this wasted opportunity is already a thing of the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and this is a batsman that I rate very positively.
He’s the x-factor cricketer we saw here in Yorkshire at the start of the season, when he scored 236 against us on Trent Bridge, which he did a little bit of.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but all of this, of course, will depend on the overall composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen starting with Cook, who would get another extra spinner while keeping four quicks, was raised and I have no objections to it.
I don’t understand why a strokemaker can’t fire and this left-handed man has already shown that he is an amazing cricketer.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was number three for them, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 rehearsals before his performance in 2001.
He had succeeded for three centuries, and he had not looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner and when I had the opportunity to watch him, I was intrigued as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his gross stats — an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball — and I see that as a prowler, but there aren’t a lot of spinners who would raise their hands, and the selectors opted for youth.
You will learn a lot on this tour.
Outside of the team, England seems to have made several changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jayawardene, a batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for test matches can be a master move.
He is one of the most beautiful playing guys who will bring rich experience by having experience with all conditions and all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes on the white-ball tour and brings both energy and ruthless sparkle to the team.
I always felt that he was directly born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and just like Mahela, he has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, even if they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes lighten and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham’s Ben Stokes got a day off, just like Root got a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with that decision.
Although many disagree on this, coaches and selectors do not create a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts to stagnate by 2017.
David Cameron’s ill-conceived renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting into further trouble with each passing day even without the brilliant Jeremy “Is it Yes or No?” Corbyn leading the Workers’ Party, or TUC taking over the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe is drowning in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States already have enough of Britain's self-centred agenda, divisive concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they mostly did not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided that they did not want to do so even if they had ravaged social protection.
We can even call it the Dave and George selfie agenda.
The prime minister and chancellor attend summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home saying they are winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an uninhibited Britain in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," Berlin says - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have gotten to a point where they don't care about us leaving.
Angela Merkel, Germany’s cautiously balanced chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes bad for her, as was the case with the long-running Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Frenchman Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is also declining.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to watch them break their legs with the help of Selfie Brits, who could better invest their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK – something they themselves do not want, because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may be planning deliberately unhelpful SNP style notes during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, a friend claims.
"The renegotiation has solved the problem" and "Britain has nothing of value to negotiate."
To their own detriment, Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be and how sceptical the press oligarch barons are of the EU, because they were not during the Tony Benn-inspired referendum in 1975 that supported our entry in 1973 in a 2:1 ratio.
They may dimly remember the name of Boris Johnson, the sly Euro-opportunist who made his name as Brussels correspondent for "EU straight bananas" in the early 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mix of tax-exempt thugs, strangers hacking phones, and pseudo-non-sea departments that owned most of the big newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a rabid gorilla, you have to throw her bananas so she doesn't have you for dinner and then for tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron’s referendum routine, ever since Blair accepted the principle of the abrogated EU constitution, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and granted him a firing card.
The press never forgave him, either.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me gently on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he shouldn't waste any more time on me - seems in danger of re-adoption of the Murdoch Neil Kinnock boycott strategy, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, who left the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe is, to put it mildly, evolving.
He says he wants to stay in a reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside of the frenzied tendencies of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory Little Englanderism can certainly agree to it.
That’s what Hilary “Bemm but not Benniite” Benn said on radio and television this week, when his inner scout couldn’t decide to admit that Corbyn’s appointment of the abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father fought on television for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's game was much more attractive.
But to fight to stay “all the way” — Benna’s phrase — was apparently not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background, the sensitive image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he touched me too - the discipline of the news remains important in the age of all-day television broadcasting, and especially in the faith, the bashing of paranoia and betrayal that is social media.
It is fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe that would allow him to take the support of the Workers’ Party in the referendum campaign for granted, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s fundamental distortions about EU membership – in keeping with their Bennite beleaguered economy, anti-capitalist past – are no longer just a matter of esoteric debate among leftist dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small differences is the central tenet of dogmatic bickering.
As with his warping over NATO – Tom Watson is convinced the JC campaign will not want to end it – foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand the meaning of all this for their home masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - because of Britain's concessions, when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed by Britain’s “weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the cost of a conservative government in power, as I was reminded at Monday’s launch of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize review of electronic published by Public Health England
The government-funded agency’s statement that e-cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have ties to the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used in its report on e-cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
PHE released a “breakthrough” report last month, describing it as a “comprehensive review of the evidence.”
However, several researchers questioned the extent of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet magazine last month attacked an “extraordinarily shabby base” on which PHE was basing its main findings.
Two other experts writing for the BMJ questioned the claims, which were allegedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “The fundamental principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They state that the public could expect PHE’s claim, which reads “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking,” to be based on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people convened to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell report that one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO had reportedly previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
It also approved the BAT public health mandate in a sustainability report, it says.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting acknowledged funding from the e-cigarette maker, but not funding he had allegedly obtained earlier from tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reason for the selection of panel members is not available, but they contain several well-known champions of electronic cigarettes, some of which also claim industrial financing in the newspaper.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting at PHE was also attended by tobacco executives.
The report produced in this group "excusively admits," the lack of "hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products to most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claim that "there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes act as a smoking pathway for children or non-smokers" was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said the claim at BMJ had already been answered earlier.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One in two lifetime smokers will die due to their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small by comparison, but we need to continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and also what it does not show, especially when there has been so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related diseases and smoking costs the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
By clearly highlighting the current evidence - that although e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they bear only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC should end EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
Former Channel 4 director Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes like EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that its commercial rivals would “give their right hand” to hit shows like Albert Square.
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used for programmes that are not made up of other UK television broadcasts.
He has criticized the BBC for deploying public service programs that are likely to be watched by only a handful of people, into difficult broadcast times compared to his rivals' biggest rating show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After CEO Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried unsuccessfully to connect with the BBC for the six years he worked on Channel 4.
"I am fighting the idea that the BBC is commissioning and broadcasting programmes that would certainly be broadcast by rivals without state contributions," Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of negotiations on the future of the BBC.
If you keep licensing fees, which I’m not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, the creation should be reduced at least in terms of programs that others don’t produce or deliver.
They broadcast The Voice in prime time because they want to get the broadest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would broadcast it is a ridiculous joke, and, of course, meaningless.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be funded without a contribution.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course produced on home soil.
Sincerely other channels would have given their right hand for them.
I can't understand how they're a public service broadcaster.
I don't think that would weaken the BBC in the slightest.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC he felt guilty for catching up on ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His commentary on the BBC's most popular shows echoes those of Sky's former CEO, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the more pampered BBC public service programmes "go to BBC4, where quite often you can't measure the audience, but they exercise their authority and can argue when they are preparing for their hypocritical mission to justify <0xC2><0xA3>4bn of revenue from licence fees," "But of course we do all these obscure programmes that no one is looking at."
They send them out at a time when no one is looking at them.
As for the license fee, Johnson told the commission: “I urge you to find a more regressive system as to who gets the best value out of it.
Of course, we all think <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year is a big sum, but for people for whom <0xC2><0xA3>150 is a lot, I’d be surprised if they paid that much because they don’t watch the BBC that much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who spoke to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reith mission in the sense of “informing, educating and entertaining.”
He confirmed that a small volume of BBC production had now been previously classified as educational – used to be 1% TV production and 0.1% on the radio – and should be taken as a model for public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and changed to “inform, clarify and entertain”.
On the subject of the partnership, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like Proms, of which only a handful have been televised, and connect with commercial reporters so we can all see them online.
“Sonogenetics” or control of brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction in which the nematodes move.
Scientists have grown worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Small nematodes change direction when they are struck by sound impulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
Pulses work by switching the cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasound waves.
Scientists can read and record brain activity using light
The researchers said the worms are a great example of a new technique called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation — an invasive procedure in which electrodes that stimulate the brain are inserted into the patient’s brain. The method is used, for example, to treat symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
The nematodes usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction occurs when they are placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found out, the bubbles are amplified by ultrasound waves, which then pass through the body of worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves act in the TRP-4 ion channels, which are found in the membranes of some worm cells.
These channels open up and activate the cells with which they are connected, according to a report in the journal Nature Communications.
In order to control the nematodes using ultrasound waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contained TRP-4 ion channels.
When he then applied ultrasound to the modified worms, the sound waves were amplified by microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where they turned on the modified motor neurons.
The new method is in many ways similar to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off using light.
Chalasani, however, made it clear that sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate tissues without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that by using gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to the ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that the method would also find its application in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture devices - right on your doorstep!
Advertisements embarrassing the British arms trade.
Watch the video about the anti-arms market from Amnesty International.
Terrible killer drones!
Leg irons that break your ankles!
Shattered missiles!
And electric stun sticks that cause unbearable pain, but leave no traces!
The cheerful voice and caricature of the metaphors leave no doubt that this advertisement at the world’s largest arms fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the British government’s willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the International Veselice defense and security facilities at the ExCeL Centre in London’s Docklands district.
DSEI Arms Fair: Authoritarian Regimes Descend on London
But a separate campaign is also conducted with the emergence of posters at bus stops and meters that require a second look.
"Important announcement, Traveling on the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" reads one, using the London Underground signs with DLR lines becomes the image of a tank.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will descend on the DPR... Customers are being asked to help stop the arms trade.
300 posters are created by artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group has helped distribute it across London and using “Ad Space Hack Packs”, a <0xC2><0xA3>6-per-piece Allen key that reportedly “will gain access to roughly a third of the bus station advertising space on the planet.”
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodies produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and assistant professor at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to viewers outside the gallery.
Many artists switch to working with activists as part of protest movements and realize they need to get out in the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another one of the anti-arms trade posters greets the passengers on the subway.
Amnesty’s video was viewed by more than 100,000 people on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by VCCP, a non-fee agency, and the graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever would have been surprised by the silence surrounding the arms trade ads — he saw an empty space in the ExCeL calendar — and thought, “Let’s show them a campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They toyed with creating more realistic risky corporate ads, but “by adding colorful colors and animations, we’ve made it more appealing to more people.”
“They’ve done a fantastic job of helping us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair,” said Tom Davies, Amnesty International’s director.
What we now need is for the UK Government to take action to ensure that torture facilities are not illegally trafficked on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. military for an “armed AT4CS RS launcher.”
This includes “a uniquely shaped head that delivers amazing effects from behind the armor inside the target.”
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
8 Golden Rules for Student Life
Eleven years ago, I moved to college as an oblivious 19-year-old boy, still a believer in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I recall the strained smiles of those I’ve bothered—and the numerous, lengthy complaints I’ve made about others.
Everything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving to a dorm can range from mildly nerve-wracking to totally horrendous.
It’s tempting to babble: tell people where you’re from, if you’ve taken a year off, what you think of Corbyn, and why you “honestly don’t love or hate Marmite, because people, it’s just an extract of HAHAHA yeast, I’ll be in my room.”
Take a deep breath.
And help others to take a breath too - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you love and the ones you wouldn't talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were putting out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People’s rooms often turn into drinking receptions, movie night spots, and communal public places, but they’re also rooms where people dress up and change their underwear.
Related: Don’t even think about going to college and being in a relationship
Introverts in college will come in handy.
Your room should be a haven, yet a lot of the dorms are turning into an out-of-room walking culture that is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendships.
This can be hell for someone who needs to recharge.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so I can get back to the energy I used to talk to you."
Try to figure out when a classmate is tired of socializing — and maybe text him instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: knock.
A boy in my dorm used to be invited in if the door wasn't locked.
He saw a few things.
Make friends with baking.
Since you started going to university at the height of baking mania, knocking on someone else's door and performing with a plate of baked cookies seems slightly less weird, less than "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile while I ask personal questions."
Offering homemade delicacies is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obligated to talk to you and may end up assigning your face to a tasty surprise.
This, of course, is the subject of being a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar, and solids are likely to interfere with others pretending to sleep when you try to knock on their door.
Stealing food is a common crime in college.
Stealing a whole chicken is a crime, of course, but is a drop of milk in your tea a theft?
Check it twice with the owner of the milk.
There is a chance that they will offer you milk even if they are raging inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more adult than my roommate, who exchanged her milk for a dishwashing agent to punish the thief.
He's in jail now.
You should not make noises that disturb people from sleeping or studying.
It’s not just about being a decent human being, but you’re also famous people in glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they could turn down the drum and bass a little bit, because it was 3 a.m. and she had a test in the morning.
Their response was to amplify the music.
When they finally quieted down at 5 a.m., she let them sleep peacefully for two hours, then played her own music out loud, locked the door, and left for her three-hour lesson.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future wife went to the same college as you?
On the contrary, wouldn’t it be horribly embarrassing if you mistook your roommates for your future spouse, slept together, broke up, and had to see each other every day, and maybe also took control of your mutual friends?
Of course, you can not tell the heart - but if your sexy roommate is not 100% your future spouse, try to talk at least a little with your weaknesses.
In the uplifting moment when you realize that someone left the keys in their unlocked room, there is only a thin line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their safety by hiding something from them – never ruin someone’s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put the keys in the water bottle, which you then put in the freezer - but never glue their things to the ceiling more than twice.
Eva looked forward to the twins despite the uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva had a difficult time during her pregnancy with today’s seven-year-old V<0xC3><0xAD>tek.
His father broke up with her and she was left alone to prepare and raise her offspring.
I coped with the situation quite quickly - I was very much looking forward to the baby and I was looking for positives in it.
With uncertainty and being alone with the child, I tried not to worry.
And I certainly had the hope that we would not be alone for a long time, Eva remembers today about her first pregnancy.
Already then she met on the Internet on the chat of the elder Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek, with whom they began to talk about their favorite films.
Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek even brought Eva and V<0xC3><0xAD>tek home from the maternity hospital, but he did not get too involved in the role of stepfather.
"He then retired from the program for a while," Eva described in the documentary series Four in Three.
The theme of the third season of the Czech television series is precisely the search for happiness on the second attempt.
She managed the care of V<0xC3><0xAD>tka and the financial security of her family thanks to part-time work and a lot of help from her mother and aunt.
Even the prospect of responsibility for a stranger's child did not spoil Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek's affection for Eve.
They definitely got together around V<0xC3><0xAD>tka’s second birthday and he now understands Va<0xC5><0xA1>ka as his father and also calls him that.
Although Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek already has two adult daughters, he enjoys fatherhood at the age of sixty, according to his words, and he also devotes more attention to children.
In addition to V<0xC3><0xAD>tek, they were joined by a two-year-old Leont<0xC3><0xBD>nka and, finally, twins.
"Your father came into our family so naturally, perhaps because my mother never talked to me much," Eva thinks smiling.
Not enough room?
At least we're close.
The twins, Emma and Ela, were born by caesarean section after Eva was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis at the end of her pregnancy.
This is a disorder of the production and activity of bile acids, which then occur in excessive amounts in the blood of pregnant women and are manifested mainly by itching.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fetus, which is at risk of premature birth and death, in the mother after childbirth, it usually disappears spontaneously.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Eva and Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek’s happiness, even though they were only in the 36th week.
Emi<0xC4><0x8D>ka was placed in an incubator at the intermediate department, where Va<0xC5><0xA1>ka’s niece works, who managed to take over and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger and immediately after the transfer from the ICU to the room I had her with me, she describes the difficult period after the birth of Eva.
She spent 20 days in the hospital until the doctors allowed the release of the babies, who in the meantime managed to reach the limit of two kilos.
But waiting for the baby to be born in the maternity hospital was not a joy.
"I was crazy about my husband and my kids," recalls a four-time mother of six in the department.
She and her husband were considering signing the reverse, among other things, because of the insensitive attitude of one of the doctors.
However, this did not happen and the doctors released Eva and the twins into home care.
Stories of four pregnancies and births are broadcast by <0xC4><0x8C>T1 on Tuesday evening at 21:45.
A large family can be humbled.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to make do with an electric two-burner and cramped conditions.
The house did not enlarge, but Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek made Eve happy by installing a gas cooker to make preparing food for six people more comfortable.
When it's coldest, we'll take turns taking taxis.
Eva is convinced that children perceive especially family well-being and a pleasant atmosphere, and not the size or sensibility of the house.
So far, we've gotten along very well, better than we expected.
The mess is harder to hide in a small space and we sometimes cross the border, but at least we are all close, smiles Eva, who can find a positive side to any situation.
Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek’s work as an illuminator in film is not a guarantee of regular income.
That’s why he sometimes goes to the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
At the age of 60, he says, he is physically able to take care of his family and children’s finances, but how long will that be?
"I realize that due to our age difference, one day I will be the one to feed this family," Eva admits flatly when asking about the future.
She would like to return to work, but she is even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
With four kids, I'm not exactly a sucker for employers.
And when the worst comes to the worst, my husband and I can take turns taking a cab, jokes a cute blonde.
Apple had a yo-yo effect.
It's all the displays.
A more powerful processor, a higher-resolution camera, a stronger chassis, or a display that recognizes the power of touch are in short the advantages of the recently introduced ninth-generation iPhones.
The latter two then also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
Apple’s trend so far has been that each new generation of iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
The only exceptions were the third and fourth generations, whose weight increased slightly compared to the previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight difference to the detriment of the news was really negligible.
However, this is far from the case with the new iPhones.
Compared to last year’s iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the weight increased by 14 grams for the smaller model, and by 20 grams for the larger model.
On the one hand, it is not surprising that last year’s affair was greatly troubled by the bending in Apple’s pockets.
The chassis of the novelty is thus made of a more durable aluminum alloy 7000, which was also projected on the weight.
But the displays have a much greater impact on it.
Apple has used 3D Touch technology to detect the power of touch.
To do this, it was necessary to equip the display with another layer of capacitive sensors.
The weight of the new iPhone displays has more than doubled compared to previous generations.
For the smaller iPhone from originally 12 grams to 29 grams, in the case of the larger one from 19 to 40 grams.
With the iPhone 6s, the display is the hardest component to use.
The weight of only 143 grams is then achieved with this novelty thanks to the degreasing peel, which has affected most of the remaining components.
In the larger model, it is then the heaviest battery element used, but its weight has not changed compared to its predecessor.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is evident in the display.
The weight of the iPhone 6s Plus reaches 192 grams.
As far as the new display technology is practical, it will manifest itself only in use.
The first users will be able to try it on Friday, September 25, when the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will be launched in selected countries.
Have breakfast cereal champions been around for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists managed to find a discovery that opens up interesting possibilities.
They found traces of settlement by modern man from different times, including wall paintings, remnants of tools and so on and so forth.
But in layer 23A, which according to the instruments dates back to about 30,000 years ago, scientists have discovered something that closely resembles the remains of a breakfast buffet.
In fact, traces of oat grains were found on the site, which apparently went through the process of producing today’s popular flakes.
At the same time, the grains are first soaked, then dried, removed from the packaging, the so-called plough, then boiled and peeled flat.
In the cave Paglicci managed to find grains that were apparently heated or steamed, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least this is indicated by traces of use on two stones in the cave.
Thus, scientists could not prove in their publication for the PNAS magazine that a complete flake production process would take place in the cave, but the similarity is indeed very striking.
We also have no evidence of how people could have eaten the flakes, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and quite possibly even warm, of course, offers quite logical.
At the same time, it is a very interesting proof of how intensively people used cereals long before the advent of agriculture.
If the Flakes interpretation is correct, the oldest Flakes outperformed agriculture by about twenty thousand years.
New station reports in the Brno City Transport Company.
So once again I listened to the announcement of the names of stops in the trolleybus: Hnusá<0xC4><0x8D>ková, P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>zrak, Prázova, Spratecká.
Sure, the trolleybus was a bit louder, so reporting in a male voice was a bit less intelligible than before, when stops were reported in a female voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of traffic it is more recognizable than the deeper male voice.
Although DPMB argues that this announcer was chosen by the passengers themselves - I do not know who, no one asked me, but they certainly chose this from studio recordings taken in complete silence, which, of course, sounded quite different from the bus engine noise.
I have been living in Brno for a few decades now, so I know the correct names of all these stops by heart, so I do not need these reports, but foreigners from elsewhere who do not know anything about Brno and for whom these reports are primarily intended, may be confused and may claim that the stop they were supposed to have reached by mistake was not at all announced.
Perhaps the choice of the announcer - but better again the announcer - should be made again, and this time tinted with the usual traffic noise and the roar of the engine, in which the muttering of the speaker on the bus almost disappears.
So that we no longer have to listen to the names of the stations Water Her<0xC5><0xA1>pice, <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>rov, or then Submerged in the creaking salina into which I moved in Komárov.
I suppose my old man's hearing didn't get so bad all of a sudden during the one day that the caller changed.
Before that day, I understood the report quite well.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the tracker notes.
Today, few people know what the biggest and smartest so-called comprehensive checks were during the party’s rule.
I took the liberty of remembering it.
The bus was late.
I rushed into the dispatcher's office the moment the radio said it was seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't bump into Comrade Chief, he came a minute before you, and he doesn't seem to be in the mood," said the dispatcher as I signed up for the arrivals book.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Write to me that I'm going to the precincts to review a small mechanization.
I can't do that. I mean, today's the day.
They're all fucking terrified.
What's the big deal?
"You'll see," the dispatcher sneered.
Next time, you'll be too.
I ran out into the hall.
Then the door of the chief's office opened, and the chief appeared.
Clamped, with a stone face, in a perfectly fitting uniform.
"Good morning, Mr. Chief," I said respectfully, quickly turning on two buttons on my uniform jacket.
"Good morning," was the reply, and I hurried to the second floor, not realizing the cold, sinister tone with which the old man had replied.
"You're playing," said the engineer, Eva, an elderly lady whom I held in high esteem.
She said she was even a chief before her comrades deposed her.
There's a background check, and you'll be there in no time.
How many times have I asked what these complex checks are, but no one wants to talk about it too much.
They say it's once every three years, they all have to go to them, and it's quite unpleasant.
At least for some.
I'm told I'll see.
I pulled out a folder with periodic reports and then a phone.
"This is Holcman, come to me now," said the chief's voice.
What's the poison?
Now we met and nothing ..." I mumbled, but no one answered me, each with his own thoughts.
"Hello, Comrade Chief, I'm here on your orders," I reported, barely entering the chief's office.
The chief was sitting at his desk, looking at a sheet.
"Comrade Mechanic," he said after a moment, without raising his head and still looking carefully at the sheet, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the chandelier down on the table, leaned against the back of the chair and stared at me with his usual, unpleasant, evil, prickly look.
I'm not sure.
What's going on? What's going on?
Yesterday, the deputy praised that I worked very well during those few months in office and that he is extremely satisfied with me.
That the chief did very well to pull me out of the platoon at a distance.
And now this?
Remember that you are a distance track technician and you have to act accordingly.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I stammered that I had been using such a greeting since childhood, that I had been so brought up and that I saw nothing wrong with it.
For the chief, it was like a red turkey rag.
"You're on the Socialist railway, and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of the job," said the indignant chief.
And besides, you're still wrong about calling your superiors.
You say "sir" once and "comrade" again.
But I'm not Mr. Chief to you. I'm Comrade Chief.
The deputies are comrades-in-arms, the chief linemen are comrades-in-arms!
Please remember that!
I'm sorry, sir... Comrade Chief, but... I greeted you with a common civic greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and the honor of the job, or comrade... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your preference that you're not on the sidelines," the chief said coldly, who had calmed down a little in the meantime.
There will be talk of it.
Anyway, remember, you don't have a pension on that chair up there.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something was not his priority, it did not look good with the person concerned.
For a moment he pierced me with a cold, prickly look, and I searched for words to answer.
I was also annoyed by his haughty stuttering.
He was only a few years older, and he was playing the lord-god, actually the comrade-god.
Jovial, cocky, authoritarian, arrogant, as he pleases at the moment.
They all gave him a hard-on.
Yeah, he's the chief.
In fact, not all, the chairman of the party organization, like all party members, but also non-party members, was babbling to him.
But the chief was poking at many, especially those to whom he could assert his superiority.
Right now, he's rubbing me for complete bullshit.
I thought of something about the ass, and it cost me enough of a beating not to shoot him in the face.
But I wouldn't go back to the pick-up line, let alone continue to be a railway official.
What would I feed two kids?
And then there's the house that's been built!
I was sick of crying, but I managed.
I'm not gonna make him happy.
"That's all for now, you're free to go," the chief concluded, and began to examine again the chandelier he'd previously held in his hand.
They called me at half past three.
Everyone from the office was already there, and when asked what and how, they replied that yes, it would be good.
Only Jo<0xC5><0xBE>in said, bitingly, as was his custom, that we could not all be fired, because the work would have to be done by his comrade-in-chief alone with his faithful, and that he was not in danger.
The word "comrade" was emphasized, as if he knew what the old man had done to me this morning.
There was a nice gathering in the chief's office.
Comrade Chief at his desk and at the long advisory table other comrades who were to decide on my official existence or non-existence.
Kádrovák, chairman of ROH, HR clerk, special-purpose clerk, something like a counterattack in the military, and a deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from scratch.
An ordinary track-worker, he'd beaten the sleepers or pitched the gravel with his pitchforks.
But also a former guard.
It was rumored that there was no fun with him at the time, that he was a pretty beast.
Evil tongues claimed that he went to school in the seventh grade, learned nothing, knew nothing.
And when the crime was dropped, he ended up at a pickpocket.
But comrade, yes, comrade was forged!
The chief motioned for me to sit down.
There was a little soul in me, an incorruptible lump in my throat.
Kádrovák read the report from the civic committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working class family, I am married, two children and so on and so forth.
So far so good, I thought, and I was breathing a little better.
Then a report from the party's street organization.
He copied the report from the citizens' committee, maybe they were both written by the same person.
But then it came!
Parents of long-time party members refused to appear before a review committee and subsequently spoke from the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me sharply.
The cadre saw it and stopped reading.
The chief motioned to continue.
It only got worse after that.
I was a member of the SSM city committee, and there I was recruited as a party candidate.
Regardless of the parents who came out of the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married, and besides the national committee, I also had a wedding in the church.
I have disappointed the party in the worst way.
That's why I was cut from her list of candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even my mother, when she died, had a church funeral, even though she was a former party member.
All of this shows a negative attitude to the leading role of the party.
When the cadre finished reading, it was only the tapping of the chief's pencil on the tabletop that broke the tense silence.
Everyone was staring at me, and I wished I was somewhere far away.
I kept saying to myself, "Communists - superhuman, communists - superhuman." What did I get myself into?
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmiths?
I was able to fix the switches without some fucking background check.
But now?
Her career as a railway official took over before she started.
Back in the platoon?
I don't think I can do that. I'm sure the chief will fire me for an hour.
"Comrade, how did you examine the comrade discussed here?" the chief interrupted with a tense silence, asking a question about the cadre.
Well, according to a report from a previous job.
Do you have it here?
Obviously, Kadrovák didn't do it twice.
Sweat dripped on the scraps, blinking nervously, as if he had been tested himself.
He nodded eagerly and handed the chief a piece of paper.
"No," said the chief, with a hint of joviality, which was often a harbinger of a storm.
At first glance, the praise itself, taught with honors, graduated in industrial engineering, worked in the task wage as a locksmith, the norm fulfilled on average one hundred and twenty percent.
But the essentials are missing.
Where did you get that assessment, comrade?" he asked again to the cadre, who felt that somehow it was beginning to turn against him, and that very soon he might not even have to be a cadre.
This is where my comrade gave it to me on the way in.
Is that enough for you?
'Well, when he joined us, he went to the platoon district, 'bleeched the cadre.
And there's no judgment required, his was kind of extra, so I put it in his file.
"So that's enough paper for you when you're put into a technical position," the chief said dryly.
The cadre blinked nervously and had no answer.
"Never mind, we'll discuss that later," the chief concluded, and the cadre was obviously relieved.
For the time being, it's stable.
"What about you, comrade?" the chief turned to me again.
All of a sudden, it's over!
My eyes darkened, I was drenched with heat.
There followed a torrent of remorse and recrimination, and I knew that I was the most disgusting creature in the world who did not deserve the slightest mercy.
That by insinuating an incomplete report, I had misled a fellow HR officer, and I did not understand why the report was incomplete when I got it from an HR officer at the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist element who, at the time of building real socialism, supports and even participates in the breeding of religious obscurantism.
That, yes, there was a lot of what I had done, or maybe I would still do, and I prayed silently that it would end.
I didn't care anymore.
I didn't care if I flew out of the mechanic's seat.
I didn't care if they took my pick.
This is work for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people, as I was in the eyes of Comrade Chief.
'That's enough, Comrade Chief, 'the party chairman said suddenly, interrupting the chief's levity forcefully.
Here comrade made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he's made a fool of himself!
He has already received his punishment.
Don't forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young man than to close the door to his side for a while!
In order to open up to him again, he will have to prove that he has changed, that he is worthy of our trust again.
The uneducated guard spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is he so well-read or parroting phrases from party trainings and meetings?
That is why this young comrade must also get a chance from us!
A chance to prove he's changed.
And who's gonna give it to him if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty, indeed, to support this young, somewhat misguided comrade in his efforts to correct!
It's your party duty, and no one's going to get rid of you!
In fact, it is a party duty for all of us.
Here the comrade must see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother, she not only punishes, but also loves.
When the President finished, no one even spoke.
No one expected such a turn of events.
Least of all me.
"I totally agree with you, Comrade Chairman," the Chief nodded coldly, trying to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me finish, you'd have heard that's the conclusion I was coming to.
They all nodded in agreement, but they could see that they didn't believe a word he said.
"So I was confirmed as a stand-alone asset officer," I blurted out as I returned to the office, and then burst into tears.
Well, except for Eva's engineer, they were all at lunch.
She listened in silence to my disjointed account of fresh experiences, and I calmed down in the meantime.
When I finished, she asked if I wanted coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put the water on the stove and prepared the cups.
In the meantime, she was talking about the practice of cadres.
How one opinion, often full of praise, they give to a person, and the other, in which there is any dirt, they send to a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was supposed to, but on a scraper by the pickaxe, so the comrades from the factory didn't know where to send it.
And our cadre?
He just wants to know where he'd eat or drink, and that's how it turned out.
'He'll get it from the old man, 'she said maliciously.
I'm sure he won't like it today.
Watch out for him anyway, he's pretty vindictive.
And the party chairman?
In fact, a much worse chief, no humane.
Zero from a pickaxe with a lot of power.
The water for the coffee began to boil, and then the office was filled with the smell of just poured coffee.
I threw a lump of sugar into the cup and silently stirred the hot potion.
Maybe I'm out of the worst.
I'm not getting fired now, and I don't have any more background checks until three years from now.
Anyway, Comrade Chief, I'm not going to forget today.

The alien symbol came to life.
The windmill wheel over Chlum is turning again after years.
It can be seen from afar, because it is located on a fifteen-meter-high mast.
People from all over the world call it "the windmill on Chlum".
For the municipality with 150 inhabitants, it has even become one of the elements of the municipal emblem, which the municipality acquired on the occasion of the meeting of the natives in 2010.
"We asked for a sign at that time and we wanted to have a fan on the sign, of course, everyone in the area knows him," said Mayor Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Ma<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The Khlum wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is a bit of a memento of the present: it reminds us of the time when local people fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries was a rarity.
It was not until 1910 that Khlum deputies decided on a solution that would suit them until the mid-1980s.
In the village at the branch to <0xC4><0x8C><0xC3><0xAD>chov, they dug a seven-meter-deep well.
Three years later, the well was supplemented with a metal structure with a wind pump, which pumped water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by the company Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Kunc from Hranice na Morav<0xC4><0x9B> at a cost of 2 400 crowns," reads the memorial inscription on the ground floor fence of the mast structure.
The pump, after several repairs and falls of the wind wheel, was completed in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter of the struggle for water began to be written: on that day, a new water supply line began to serve in Chlum.
The wind pump has remained only a non-functional municipal symbol and a local rarity.
The dominant was put into operation at this year's meeting of the natives.
It was not until 2008 that Chlum<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xAD> decided to repair the wind wheel again and put it back into operation.
They had a replica of the original wheel made - reduced in diameter by half a metre.
The wheel was mounted on a mast, but in the same year it had to be brought down.
The manufacturer of the replica did not choose the right material and the wheel could not resist the gusts of wind.
Then the Chlum dominant rested under the roof for several years.
However, since June this year, the high-mast wheel has been spinning again.
On the occasion of the meeting of the natives, the village had the replica of the bicycle modified and re-set it on top of the iron tower.
But the wheel only draws utility water from the well into the overflow blind arm.
And over the summer, we disconnected it completely, because there was little water in the well.
At least it was empty.
"In the autumn, we will disconnect the windwheel shaft from the pump in the suction basket again," explained Mayor Ma<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic where the wind wheel got into the municipal emblem, but it is the only village of this kind in the entire Highlands.
A similar element in the emblem is commemorated by local technical monuments such as Chvalkovice and Zelena Hora in the Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov region, Ku<0xC5><0xBE>elov in the Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>n region, Partutovice in the P<0xC5><0x99>erov region or Police in the Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n region.
Nothing wrong, but I don't know Lafata, the Tripoli Goian supporter admitted.
"I remember the match against Slavia very well, and my goal, like everyone else in my career," the 34-year-old smiled at Goian at a pre-match press conference.
We were coached by George Hagi back then, it was a shame we lost.
I hope to score a goal for Sparta now.
Only difference is, we're not going to lose this time," Goian continued.
This man, who played 60 matches for the Romanian national team, is a key support for the Greek team.
As a hitchhiker, he will face the onslaught of the Spartan offensive.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, says the Spartan Hybs about the Greek battle.
And partly he knows what he can expect on Thursday night.
I know well Fataie, who played in the Romanian Astra with my brother Lucian.
At that time, I saw all their matches.
I know he's a very good striker, that's why he went to Sparta, Goian said.
He did not name any other players of the Prague club, so there was a direct question whether he knew David Lafata, the best scorer in the history of the Czech league and captain of Sparta.
Goian smiled and looked at the Czech journalists with a slightly reproachful look.
The helpless expression on his face meant, "Why are you asking me this?"
After a moment of silence, he let go.
We saw some videos and I noticed that Sparta plays a lot of team.
He has really good players.
And Lafata?
Nothing wrong, but I don't know anyone else but Fatai.
The Spartans know all too well about Goian.
"He has experience from bigger clubs, you can say that he is holding the defense of Asteras, he is their organizer of the game," said Stanislav Hejkal, a Spartan assistant.
Goian has already had his best years, but he can boast of a very interesting football biography.
At one time he was interested in Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City, but Steaua went to Palermo, Italy, and played for the Glasgow Rangers.
We expect an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly plays European cups, fights for victory in the Czech league.
For me, he is the favorite in this match, but we play at home and we want to start the group with a good result.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, Goian said.
I am in a room with Slovak goalkeeper Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Ko<0xC5><0xA1>ick<0xC3><0xBD>, who is very looking forward to his opponent from the Czech Republic.
Me, too.
But for the whole team, I can say that we will fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new headquarters should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for trading in the company’s shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the headquarters of the group in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far under the project are mostly legal and administrative and do not have a factual impact on the events in the company, says Daniel Bury<0xC5><0xA1>, CFO of the Kofola Group.
"In connection with the relocation of the Group's registered office, shareholders are considering placing shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to its entry into the Prague Stock Exchange, the company is finalizing a security prospectus, which it will submit to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the holding’s registered office and the related share transfers will take the form of a non-public transaction, with only existing shareholders participating.
Therefore, no shares will be offered for subscription to the public or to new investors under this operation.
“A potential share offering to new investors would take place – if the company and its shareholders choose to do so – later, either in Q4 2015 or Q1 2016,” the company said.
The company has said in the past that a potential share offering could consist of the issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the placement of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Test of objectivity of Czech Television in informing about the migrant crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of the news coverage of the main Czech media about the refugee crisis.
This time the main news broadcast of the Czech Television.
And how did it stand up?
When they teach at the Faculty of Journalism about how the media can manipulate reality, they can broadcast today’s Czech Television Events.
About 80% of the news broadcasts were devoted to the migrant crisis.
Until the first minute, when the Czech News Agency reported on the unrest on the Serbian-Hungarian border and called the attacks of migrants on police officers euphemistically ran out of patience - they threw stones and attacked with metal rods), the current pro-migrant propaganda was already on the way - judge for yourself the names of individual reports.
Criticism of non-governmental organizations - a large space for non-profit organizations that criticize the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech school - the story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
The <0xC4><0x8C>T consistently uses the terms refugee or refugee and not migrant.
What is striking is that the Czech Television consistently uses only and only images of young children and women in its illustrations.
In the same broadcast, she said that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: For the most part, propaganda that has no parallel from communist agitators.
As a former journalist, I am ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I once managed to get a flat, I soon ceased to be the only inhabitant.
I've got some fish in my macarte toilet.
Domestic fish, insects with an imperfect transformation, i.e., not losing that transformation from caterpillar to beetle and cub, looks like an adult individual, only it is small and gradually grows.
I hated them, and I didn’t want to kill them.
First by hand and then by chemical means.
The socialist drugstore provided some kind of blue crystals for their destruction.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or something else?
However, this has eliminated them successfully.
I did the same with the Pharaohs.
A box with some kind of juveniler, which the ants brought to the nest, and then he did not allow the queen to generate new offspring.
But I've turned that around.
As time went on, insects became the object of my admiration, and I became more and more inclined to believe that they had the same right to life as we humans.
In addition, I have learned from life that intervention in the ecosystem does not lead to success and one pest can be replaced by another.
The truth about fleas and bedbugs is that I wouldn't hesitate to make my karma worse by killing them.
In the new home, my partner and I agreed that if the fish do not go by the neck, let them eat the flaky skin, some invisible algae and the like.
Their peaceful existence was disrupted by the spider over time.
It was a common type of pilgrim who had long lived on the ceiling.
We thought he lived off occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only increased our comfort.
Since he lived with us for several years, we found that he mainly feeds on small fish and that their number apparently maintained a tolerable numerical condition.
With a confidential regular contact with each need, we found out that it is a female.
For we have witnessed romantic courtship with a partner about a third smaller, carefully taunting the threads of cobwebs, lest he be devoured before he reaches the coveted copulation.
It took about three days, when they did not move and did not respond to our controls.
Under the toilet bowl, where the love games took place, we later found the remains of a dried male next to the female.
Then the spider did not move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the number of little spiders hanging around her.
They were soon gone.
They were eaten by their mother by the work, they were scattered elsewhere by the work.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
Whether she went elsewhere or died, we don't know, but after a month or two, she reappeared on the ceiling.
That's right, a little smaller, probably the daughter of that toilet lady.
For some time, she watched our behavior carefully from the ceiling and, moving under the toilet bowl, assessed our non-aggression as friendship.
The numbers of the slightly multiplied fishes decreased again, and the spider calmly watched its normal activities to provide food.
Our ecosystem hasn’t changed in a year.
Our daughter, meanwhile, had reached an age when using potty was a disgrace.
So far we have tolerated it, but the eternal pouring of its contents has already eaten away at us.
We encouraged her to use the toilet more and more.
But the daughter found an excuse to maintain her bad habit in that spider she saw very well when wiping.
Our talk about seeing a spider, having luck in the house did not take at all.
Crying and screaming, she forced her potty.
It wasn't wasted.
There came a time when the spider had to take orders, in the interest of her daughter's developmental shift.
It's up to me.
He was caught in a glass and thrown across the balcony into the garden.
I said good-bye to him as if he were my friend, but I still felt bad after living with him for so long, as if I were throwing away a relative.
We assumed that the ponds would begin to appear more often and begin to multiply in a geometric series.
Wonder the world, a week or two, none of us showed up.
I began to speculate on the cause.
I wondered if the ant-like spider hadn't grown them somehow, that the environment of the toilet wasn't as favorable to their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and they were swarming again.
I had to come up with a different theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I found that their attachment to the spider must have been due to the fact that if they didn't see it, that it was hidden in some other place and that they were in danger from anywhere.
Or maybe they had some sort of telepathic connection to their predator, and its rapid disappearance triggered some kind of alarm.
Especially since I don't have any illusions about their sight.
They showed some light timidity, but that they would react to waving their hands or quick movements, not that.
My daughter goes to the bathroom regularly.
I think she's forgotten her potty.
All that remains is to attract a spider.
I'm already sending my wishes on the air, and I hope they haven't shut me down after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use that Cyclone B.
The Ten Words of Albert Einstein That Enriched the World
The statements of a brilliant scientist of the last century will probably never cease to fascinate mankind.
He was able to dive so deep into everything that the product was always a stunning discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was one of the greatest scientists of all time.
He entered the consciousness of people primarily through his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic ratio.
It is also impossible to forget his explanation of the photoelectric effect or the idea of quantization of the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the description itself and the system of knowledge of the popular theory of relativity are so intricate for many people that they prefer easy adaptations for closer acquaintance.
But it is not easy.
But it would not be Albert Einstein if he did not find a brilliantly simplified form of explanation for this: A watch near your beloved seems a minute; a minute in a hot oven seems an hour - and that is relativity.
I took the liberty of choosing from his entire list of famous quotes these ten that literally captivated me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, geniuses try not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
Space and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right.
But only he can prove me wrong at any time.
But it is a sad time when it is easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of the mess in the mind, what then reflects the empty table?
I don't know what he's going to fight in World War III, but in World War IV, it's going to be sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
To know little is dangerous, and to know much is dangerous.
If I had an hour to master the problem on which my life depended, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it, and 5 minutes solving it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand is income tax.
Finally, I cannot forgive myself for not including Einstein’s formula for success: If we take A for success, the formula is: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y is rest, and Z is holding your tongue.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n region are waiting for changes for 1.5 billion.
"It's a success considering that all four of them have been holding on to the black numbers all this year," said Governor Stanislav Mi<0xC5><0xA1>ák.
The total profit of regional facilities at the moment is about 32 million crowns.
This is mainly due to higher payments from insurance companies, which are equally favorable for this year.
Even this fact shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally afford more investment.
In Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>, Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n, Uherské Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> and Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n, it is thanks to this that the buildings will cost almost CZK 1.5 billion.
The long period of time when we mainly bought appliances is over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them top health care cannot be done, explained Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, Regional Deputy for Health Care.
Changes are expected in all hospitals.
The doctors will be in the hospital next year.
In Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n, suppliers of the new internal pavilion are now being selected for almost CZK 300 million.
In Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>, they have a dialysis extension planned.
Uherské Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> wants to add a new boarding house for about 200 million to the central pavilion opened this year.
A long-delayed construction of a new central income and an internal care facility, which will require three-quarters of a billion, is waiting for Bata Hospital in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n.
In all cases, these are fundamental and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"For the whole region, patients and doctors, this is an extremely important step," said V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Prousková, director of the hospital, for example, in relation to the construction of the Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n hospital.
The five-storey building is to be completed in about two years and will offer comfortable equipment for internal medicine and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and intensive care units.
Greater comfort for patients.
The changes, which are widely recognized by patients, will affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which, for example, many patients lie in one room, they have only one toilet on the floor, the beds are non-positionable, the windows are leaky and the medical staff do not have adequate conditions for work.
"For example, our boarding school was built thirty-five years ago and now it is on the verge of its life," said Pavel Calabek, director of the hospital in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Within a few years, it will be replaced by a seven-storey modern building connected with emergency income.
Thus, both doctors and patients will have all acute departments in one place, in addition to new premises.
The same model already has a half-finished Uherské Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>.
Central income is already standing, and in three years it will be added to the internal.
"We will pay for the construction on credit and partly from our own funds," explained director Petr Sládek.
This hospital is the only one in the region that can afford its own funding.
The profit is still the highest and it did not get to the loss even two years ago, when perhaps the hospital in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n was struggling with almost two hundred million losses.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, we increase revenues and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," said Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of the economy.
Patients of Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE> Hospital will also see improvements.
In ten to fifteen years, up to half a billion crowns will be spent on repairs, new devices and reconstructions.
This year, the repair of the interception station will be completed, then the addition of dialysis, or the construction of a building for a new magnetic resonance imaging will begin.

No one has explained to me how I should keep refugees in the country if they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
Czech Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), after talks with his European colleagues, complains that other Czech states are pushing for the adoption of quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but they reject any discussion.
He also notes that no one has yet explained to him how he should keep assigned refugees in the Czech Republic, if they do not want to live here anyway.
"We did not receive an answer, so we wanted the quotas to be removed from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe in more concrete terms the position that you have taken at the meetings of the Ministers of the Interior and Foreign Affairs of the European Union?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as a system that simply cannot work.
We cannot talk about migrants as bags of salt or flour.
They are living beings who have visions, they are going somewhere, they have relatives.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we would be able to keep migrants on the territory of the Member States if they were to be redistributed.
We can't imagine.
We did not receive an answer, so we wanted the quotas to be deleted from the final text.
With the other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration points, border protection, camps outside Europe, the trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year, and we're saying this is the way.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
We've dealt with forty thousand before, now it's one hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep these people in the area?
Ninety-eight percent of the people who cross us want to go to Germany.
Almost no one wants us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others, who take the Czech Republic as a destination country, receive asylum in our country, have ambitions to come to us, but the interest of people from this migration wave, that is, from Syria and other countries, is limited to close to zero.
You mentioned that the refugees don’t even want to come to us, but we have already committed to admit fifteen hundred people.
Would it not be possible to receive more of them in this way?
We are committed to taking in 1,500 people, but with a condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operation.
Even for the 1500, the point is that there will be 1,100 people with whom we will deal with the asylum procedure.
They'll come to our detention facility and we'll treat them the same way we did the ones we caught.
It is a big question, and we will debate this with Europe, whether we can detain people who will be registered in Italy and in Greece or in Hungary.
Because Europe is behaving in such a way that if they have a registration, they cannot be detained.
That is, they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement that is not yet there, it may happen that we will not keep even the 1100 in the Czech Republic and they will leave for Germany again upon arrival.
If we can detain them for the duration of the asylum procedure, we will handle the asylum procedure with them.
If they are citizens of Syria, Eritrea, almost 98 percent of them receive international protection, according to European statistics.
Then they will receive documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will be resettled.
This is the second project that is still underway, and we have only advanced there by debating with the churches about the possibility that they could help them find jobs, housing, and so on.
But that's a long run.
You said that the other countries were not willing to discuss with us at the ministerial meeting.
But is it not the case that the Czech Republic only rejects quotas, but does not offer any solidarity step that would unblock the discussion?
And what exactly do you think this solidarity step should be?
If the Federal Republic of Germany gives an incentive that all migrants from Syria can come to them, the message spreads in hours across all camps in Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It triggers another wave of migration that is heading to Germany because they just don’t want to come to us.
We think that the way is to protect the external borders - simply to discourage those migration waves, to help the needy, and to separate economic migrants.
Make it clear to them that they don’t have a chance.
Last year alone, 50,000 Kosovars came to Germany.
From a safe Kosovo, where we pay for all the saturation of that state, including the police, the courts, the prosecutor’s offices.
If we could separate them and not accept them, or accept them only according to the needs of the economies, the fifty percent of what the social systems spend on them today in vain could go to refugees.
Compared to the first day when Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's eighty, the first day it was twelve.
How far will it go to tighten border controls?
We were afraid of being caught by hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have several hundred free places in stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we detain will be returned to Austria within seven days.
We do it by default.
The Austrians are the only ones who take these people away from us, it is complicated with Hungary and the Greeks - this is a completely unnecessary story.
So where is the breaking point?
Would it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two, three days in a row, they're going to run out of capacity for us to make contingency plans.
Then I have agreed with the Prime Minister to convene an extraordinary government immediately.
He is very interested in the whole thing, we are in telephone contact several times a day.
Should this situation arise, the government can sit down de facto immediately and, in one resolution, it would decide to strengthen the police with the army, let’s say the customs administration, or possibly with the prison service.
The extreme variant is the state of emergency that Hungary has now declared in some places?
I don't think it can come this far.
Remember that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have the Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I do not know what would have to happen for this to happen on the territory of the Czech Republic, I do not want to spread alarmist information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests rather that the Hungarians will try to divert the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct route to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be affected very marginally, almost at all.
Slavia paid off a large part of its debts at the last moment.
They are trying to prevent a declaration of bankruptcy.
Football Slavia paid off its debts.
Even football players have their money.
Football Slavia stood on Tuesday for the first time due to insolvency proceedings before the court.
Almost three months after the proposal was filed by Online Services of Pacific Samoa for about 20 million crowns.
Attorney-at-law Slavia Zuzana Mládková tried to convince Judge Michaela Wenzlová within a few hours that she should not declare Slavia bankrupt.
Needless to say, she had her arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week, a large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and Czech billionaire Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xA0>imáne became the new owner of Slavia.
Apparently, money arrived at the club at the last minute from the new owners.
This is evidenced by Slavia's statement before Tuesday's court hearing - the Vr<0xC5><0xA1>ovice club on Monday, just a day before the hearing in court, sent tens of millions of crowns in debt.
"Everything was paid between September 11th and September 15th," said attorney Slavie Mládková.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, the Slovak representative Milan Ivan or the Czech midfielder Mario Li<0xC4><0x8D>ko.
Slavia also paid a fee to agent Alexander Losenicki.
On Friday, the club also paid the due fees of the city district of Prague 10.
As part of the insolvency dispute, only the claims that Slavie disputes remain de facto.
According to the club, these obligations have not arisen at all, or they are in litigation.
However, we are prepared to pay the amount in case of losing these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds in our bank account, which we can prove with an account statement," Mládková told the judge.
"Everything that was past due has been paid," Mládková said, adding that only outstanding or disputed liabilities were not paid.
It is also certain that in the coming days the judge will not decide and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she had actually paid the debts.
Then all the evidence will be evaluated.
A decision can be expected in November.
The judge ordered the negotiations to continue on November 3.
However, the decision will not be made at this meeting, but only in writing after it.

FastMig X is a representative of the latest generation of inverter welding sources.
The combination of state-of-the-art technology, hardware and software integrated into the modular design brings benefits and quick return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
From the welding of structural steel to the welding of special alloys, as well as from the welding of rough materials to the welding of thin sheets, from applications in workshops to welding in shipyards.
The incredible amount of welding curves, easy adjustment and expandability of the welding source allows you to quickly respond to changing requirements, which leads to reduced downtime, the need to rearrange the source and more productive welding.
FastMig X enables welding with state-of-the-art welding processes developed by Kemppi to ensure higher productivity and welding quality.
It stops wasting time and does not waste material or repair faulty welds.
Flexibility is ensured, there is less downtime, more welding and higher profit.
It is this year's novelty, which had its premiere in Nitra, where it also won a gold medal.
We appreciate these honors very much, as they confirm the uniqueness of the product.
The world's leading manufacturers can boast similar systems, but due to the difference in software and parameter control, the FastMig X is among the world's leading.
For those interested, delivery times are also pleasant, which are around three weeks.
We have already established our first contacts in the Czech Republic, which will certainly expand even further after the Brno Fair.
We have been its regular participants for over twenty years and almost always our business results are better than before, emphasizes Miroslav Streichsbier, head of Kemppi store in Pilsen for ARC-H.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
Blanka could be built so that she wouldn't fall.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert from the company that designed the tunnel.
Blanka could have been beaten even more safely, the expert said.
The Blanka tunnel complex could have been built in such a way that there were no two sinks of soil in Stromovka, says the production director of Satra, which is the main designer of the tunnel, Alexander Butovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
He said this on Wednesday evening during a news tour of the tunnel.
It would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
It will open to drivers on Saturday afternoon.
There is always a trade-off between price and safety.
"The tunnel could have been built more safely, but the costs are growing exponentially," Butovic said.
According to him, the conditions in Stromovka were the same all the time, yet the country fell just a few steps from where it began to be cut by a safer and more careful method.
"If these measures had been applied 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would have been half a billion more expensive," Butovic said.
The Blanka tunnel collapsed three times during construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater in Stromovka was created, in 2010 the land fell to the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrostav, Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlav, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he told Euro weekly.
According to the original plan, the construction was to cost 17 billion crowns.
If we add to this the VAT, which jumped twice during the construction period, of the seventeen billion you have twenty-one.
When added to this, technology, land purchases and engineering activities, valorization and similar items, it is 29 billion, which is not that far from the 37 again, said B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlav.
Someone ordered it and paid for it.

FedEx profits mixed, decrease in fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx has reported disappointing results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in its full-year profit forecast due to low freight demand and higher costs per land division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
During this period last year, FedEx announced that it would be hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company's shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx said it expects earnings of between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, a drop of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The reduced outlook comes despite an increase in interest rates of an average of 4.9 percent, which will manifest itself in January. 4, and higher surcharges for land transport of heavy or large parcels, which begin in November.
The company said it still expects profit growth from the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Fred Smith, the company’s chairman and CEO, said the company had “performed solid performance despite weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade.”
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said it planned to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers, about the same as it hired last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx received $692 million, up 6 percent from last year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in priority international shipping in recent years, causing revenue in its Express Unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted FedEx ground unit results.
In the last quarter, ground revenue increased by 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded higher income due to higher base rates, while profit declined in freight trade due to higher labour prices.
In pre-market trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx’s shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a decline of 11 percent year-on-year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
At its most anticipated session in years, the Federal Reserve lawmakers will spend two days sitting at the 27-foot-long Honduran mahogany table this week, deciding whether, after nearly a decade, the time has come to raise the key interest rate.
Rising above them at one end of the central bank ornament, the two-story meeting room will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation’s economic interests above everything else.
The central bank has a double congressional charge: maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be an X-factor in too close to a predictable decision to be announced on Thursday on whether the U.S. economy is ready to run when weaned from an unprecedented stimulus in the form of near-zero short-term interest rates on the spot by the end of 2008.
Although most of the data shows solid economic growth, recent turbulence in global financial markets could scare the already cautious Fed into adding to the volatility by raising its federal funds reference rate — no more than a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing to watch out for,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think they were just looking for an excuse not to increase the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient justification to wait any longer,” she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself causes nervousness in the financial markets.
About half of economists recently polled by Blomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to delay the matter, with a key indicator of only about 30% of the chances of an increase.
This would point to a decline in the stock market if the Fed raised rates only if politicians softened the decline by promising that further increases were not forthcoming.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The rally was triggered by the expectation that Fed policymakers will hold rates steady this week, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be a surprise if the Fed raised rates now,” he said.
If the Fed did, “they would have to go to the extreme in their program statement and hold the financial markets in their hands to avoid panic.”
Other experts argued that raising rates would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed well on its way to raising the rate by 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US economic recovery.
Yellen said she expects rates to rise this year through spring and early summer, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
While job creation slowed in August, the labour market has seen solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to what the Fed considers full employment.
Wage gains showed signs of lift.
And while inflation continues to fall below the central bank’s annual 2% target, Fed policymakers say the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 16% below its record value in May, as investors feared that China’s slowing economy would drag global growth down.
The market has rebounded somewhat this month and the Dow is now losing only nearly 10% of its May high.
To the Fed’s policymakers, the market turmoil provides a complex calculus of when to start raising interest rates.
“In the absence of what has happened in the financial markets, and reports of the weakness of the Chinese economy over the past few weeks, there would be tightening at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, lead researcher at UCLA’s Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now he predicts they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact this will have on the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data to rely on about the latest developments in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed’s main interests, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the whole world.
The central bank’s influence in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint by then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “narrow down” their monetary expansion in the market has triggered convulsions around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, Fed officials can be expected to follow developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of global wealth-management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that “the Fed has a history of exaggerating with movements in financial markets that seem unrelated to economic fundamentals.”
Lacker, a voting policy-making member of the Federal Open Market Committee who pushed for rate hikes, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points over three sessions “despite the limited identifiable impact on U.S. growth,” Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed those cuts.
The Fed should prioritize financial stability concerns only during a major crisis such as the 2008 market crash, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England.
The latest uproar is not even close to that level, he said.
“You certainly don’t want to be in a situation of fear of rising rates because the markets are getting angry,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I do not think they should be at the top.
Need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's a Chinese neighborhood, not a Thai neighborhood.
The market/warehouse is the only point of contact that offers a stunning array of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchenware, furniture, religious and festive decorations.
There is even a car part if you need some engine oil.
The store is massive and it will take you over an hour to get through all the alleys.
If you’re hungry for all of this shopping, go for a meal at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal trading stand (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various pick-up points.
What's in stock: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
Items are affordable and lots of items are sold in bulk.
The range of fresh products includes special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The spread of meat is great, for example, fish - the staff behind the counter will wash and bone you, even fry it for you if you wish,
A good part of the store is left to the massive freezing compartment, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, over-the-counter semi-finished products and more.
Who buys here: Restaurant owners and chefs, also independent families and individuals.
The wide streets are open to shopping carts and forklifts.
Find: Fresh monthong durian next to the cash register stand.
Location: The store is in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounded by the suburbs of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store may be occupied, parking is usually not difficult to find.
The speed on the highways will remain the same.
The acceleration to 150 km/h was rejected by the House.
On selected sections of motorways it will not be possible to increase the maximum permitted speed up to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
On Tuesday, the House of Representatives passed an amendment to the Senate, which rejected the speed increase.
The amendment to the Roads Act will now go to the President.
At the end of April, President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman said that the law allowing a speed of one hundred and fifty kilometers would veto it.
Transport Minister Dan <0xC5><0xA4>ok also opposed the increase, according to which the Czech highway network is not yet built at this speed.
On Tuesday, the Senate approved a version of the bill.
The approved amendment will now allow, in line with the government’s original proposal, a speed increase from 90 to 110 kilometers per hour on selected first-class roads, in particular four-lane ones.
The House first extended this option to highways that could be driven at speeds of up to 150 km/h in selected sections, but the Senate refused.
Members have now acceded to his proposal.
Senators, with the consent of the Minister of Transport, also excluded from the amendment the right of the traffic police to have the last word in the regulation of local roads, which are taken care of by the municipalities.
The Senate version, which was approved by the House, also envisages that sewers, water pipes or public lighting cables can be stored longitudinally under the surface of the roads.
This would save the community money on the purchase of land.
Municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads, regardless of the owner of the relevant land.
The amendment is also intended to help improve road protection and make it easier for municipalities to handle towed vehicles for which owners do not register.
Newly, municipalities could sell towed vehicles that are not registered by their owners within six months of notification of towing.
Municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight transport through their territory on second and third class roads under the threat of fines even for freight forwarding companies.
The amendment also abolishes the possibility of introducing electronic highway signs instead of paper ones, which will be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, this will save money on the introduction of an electronic system.
The <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> exprimator is going to court.
He faces 10 years in prison for overstaying his welcome.
The case relates to the allegedly overpriced Citizens’ Welcome project.
The police wanted to prosecute MP Zuzana Kailová (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in this case, but the Chamber of Deputies did not extradite her.
According to the legal classification of the case, both men face up to 10 years in prison.
The trial is currently scheduled for two days in October.
According to the prosecutor, Mand<0xC3><0xAD>k and Mac<0xC3><0xAD>k caused damage of at least CZK 1 million, according to the indictment.
The prosecutor relies on an expert opinion.
Former members of the city leadership, according to the prosecutor, by virtue of their function, unjustifiably made it possible to obtain the property benefit of the company that organized the welcome of the citizens.
According to the indictment, Mand<0xC3><0xAD>k ordered the then head of the municipal department of urban services, education and culture to address five connected companies in the tender procedure.
When another company entered the competition, which offered the lowest price, the city hall canceled the competition.
The contract was then to be entrusted by the city to the administrator, and only Darothore entered the competition, which was then assigned by the city council.
The city paid at least a million extra.
Both charges, aimed at ensuring that Darothore was awarded a public contract for the organization of the Citizens’ Welcome event in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, have acted in a long-term and coordinated manner at least in violation of the requirement to proceed with the care of a proper manager.
At the same time, according to him, they were aware that Darothore would subsequently charge <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem for the implementation of the Citizens’ Welcome event a price that would be disproportionately increased compared to the fair value of the services actually provided.
In three years, the company collected more than five million crowns for the project, according to the file.
In the end, the city paid only one part, about 1.7 million crowns, then withdrew from the contract.
According to the expert opinion, the amount paid was at least CZK 1 million overpriced.
Mand<0xC3><0xAD>k had previously rejected any violation of the law.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
I do not understand this fabricated case, the former mayor said earlier, adding that the city under his leadership had only followed up on a similar project from previous years.
From 2008 to 2010, the event was hosted by Roxy II.
"It was on the same terms, for the same money," Mand<0xC3><0xAD>k added.
Initially, the criminals wanted to indict Kailova, who was also a member of the city council.
However, the House of Representatives did not release her for prosecution.
Criminals therefore postponed the case in her case, but they expect to charge Kail after her parliamentary mandate ends.
The welcome of the citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift check for 5 thousand crowns for the purchase of children's supplies and small gifts.
Hungarian police say they have released a dog.
Then they got the press to delete the footage.
Hungarian police briefly detained an AP cameraman on the border with Serbia and forced him to delete a video of a police dog allegedly hitting a refugee.
The Hungarian government, however, has questioned the accusation.
The alleged incident occurred on Saturday evening when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants crossing a cornfield near the Hungarian city of R<0xC3><0xB6>szke to cross the border with Serbia.
Police officers intervened against the refugees and one of them had a dog with a basket on his nose attacked a Syrian man.
The dog of a man who shouted "Please, please, I'm a refugee," he knocked down, Muzi said.
The fact that Muzi was filming everything was noticed by one of the police officers and he was not allowed to leave.
The journalist was no longer allowed to call his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
Police officers took Muzi to a dark place at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
Then they ordered him to delete the record.
Muzi thus lost the result of a two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP sent a protest letter to Hungarian government spokesman Zoltán Kovács.
She called the behaviour of police officers unacceptable and said journalists should be able to cover the events without risking physical violence and without having to fear that the government will destroy legally obtained material.
Kovács questioned Muzi's account of the events, citing a police report.
He said the officers just wanted a journalist to show them if they were in some of the footage, which they said they were entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him to do anything.
"Dogs can bark - they're trained to scare off and scare a little bit, but they don't attack with certainty," says Kovács.
The Unpredictable Champions League.
Win at City kicks us in, Juventus believes
"It's disappointing, I don't think we deserved to lose," Manuel Pellegrini, City coach, shook his head.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League game.
Neither team has created many opportunities, but we have had the ball longer.
"The reason for the defeat was not in the tactics, Juventus just scored two beautiful goals," Pellegrini, whose team cashed in the competition after a long 636 minutes, said.
The finalist of last season Juventus was exactly the opposite before the clash - after the first three rounds of the Italian league has as a defender of the title only a point and with a score of 2:4 is on the 16th place of the table.
That’s why the turnout at Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, it will kick us," said Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three pillars - Pirlo, Tévez and Vidal - before the new year.
In Manchester they were replaced by Pogba, Mand<0xC5><0xBE>uki<0xC4><0x87> and Morata.
"That's right, this victory is very important, perhaps thanks to him we will ride on the winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we are on it, we are among the best teams in Europe.
In the second half we were better, especially in the offensive phase.
My players deserve this result.
“We could have scored 0-2 before our goal, but Gianluigi supported us,” said Allegri coach Buffon.
"We've burned a few good chances," Yaya Touré, City's midfielder, said.
We have to take the experience from the Champions League and try to get a better result next time.
Good-bye, Angelo, good-bye, old Germany II.
Before we go any further on the issue of immigrants, we should realize that the whole media frenzy around here is driven by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
So let's stop for a moment.
Today, newspapers and media are full of babies carrying their parents on the dusty paths of exodus.
And this automatically evokes in man - that is, in European man - a feeling of guilt and compassion.
Well, they come here not only desperate children, notice in the pictures of the landing boats to the Greek islands that the baby is not so much to see on them!
Well, somehow we have recently lost from the television images of ships heading to Lampedusa, refugees from the French border near Menton, where thousands of young men lie by the beautiful promenade.
A lot of young black people.
And the pictures have also disappeared from Callais, where these eaters and black men are waiting to make their way through the tunnel beneath the English Channel.
I don't think he's getting it anymore.
Even those pictures of the primitive Christian church of Eritreans did not make a special impression on the inhabitants of Europe.
There was too much falseness in it.
So, when it comes to quotas for refugees, it somehow hides that they are not only unfortunate children from Syria, but also well-studied - for the elderly: fashionably classy - young men.
Their muscles look like they just came out of a fitness center.
Just one personal experience.
This summer on the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we were lying on the private beach of the hotel.
Despite the fact that it was private, a large group of cars suddenly arrived at the beach.
But no ham.
And out of them came the young black men.
About thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They went to the beach, all dressed in designer clothes and shoes. In their hands, as otherwise, smartphones.
That it was a private beach did not interest them, and the employees - Turks, Muslims! - were clearly afraid of them.
They've taken all the deck chairs.
Those who did not lie on it and were just in the sea, had bad luck.
They were dressed like they were from an American rapper movie.
On the head hat with a nail, white and colorful adidas shoes on the legs.
Then they laid siege to the local beach bar and began to feast.
They sat around the tables, crammed in next to the sitting brown and white guests of the bar - read to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children fled from the dining terrace somewhere to rest.
Incoming black men drank beer straight out of the thirds - as in the series from the USA?! - on the beach throwing empty bottles around each other.
They were constantly yelling at each other.
But it was not English.
Then they started drinking wine, straight from the bottles.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in designer swimwear, especially the young ladies - screaming and screaming in the water, mothers with children and pensioners fled in horror, and in half an hour there was not a single non-black guest on the beach or in the pool.
They're all gone.
Regardless of whether you are a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff was afraid to talk about it.
The waiter said to me half-loudly that evening, "Did you see the gold they were wearing?"
"Yeah," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't," said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, they all had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had a 20-centimeter gold cross around his neck.
And women were like goldsmiths.
"Are they drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You saw them drinking," the waiter replied.
They don't smuggle drugs, they don't use them.
They're smuggling something completely different.
I knew what they were smuggling.
But in June 2105 it was not so important for me yet.
I had no idea what was coming next.
But the secret services and top politicians should have been the first to know.
I don't think they know.
At that time, about 1.5 million immigrants had immigrated to Europe.
And they go and they go and they go.
Today, it has become clear that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-political-correct politicians, as if intellectuals and the lobbyist and economically important groups attached to them, have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - now the publicly acknowledged main force in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only them, but also the top EU and TV leaders, including ours.
For example, recent television images of the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of the August 1968 images of Moscow television.
Sure, there were a few sunflowers at the station, but mostly - Old German - Muslims welcomed their compatriots.
For weeks, they have been babbling on Czech TV about how, according to some research, Germans are almost all for the arrival of emigrants.
But anyone who has only been in Germany for a few days knows that it is a lie like a tower.
This is confirmed by further information.
For example, the famous public opinion poll organized by the ARD - Czech Association of Public Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to the ARD, more than 50% of Germans wanted to take in even more refugees a week ago.
This was also reported by our TV.
However, they did not disclose what happened the next day in Germany: that in the poll vote on the article it turned out that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer want any immigrants - 67,000 people took part in the survey.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly stated in November 2010, five years ago: "Our attempt at a 'multi-cult' society has totally failed."
“Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society.”
"All attempts at such cohabitation have failed."
In a country where four million Muslims live, she said, a strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live side by side without integrating has failed. Today, they live here with us, and we have lied to ourselves for some time that they will not stay, that one day they will disappear again.
But that's not reality.
The multicultural approach of saying that we simply live happily side by side has failed.
He totally failed.
But even Merkel probably does not have the strength to go against the powerful of Germany and Europe and, above all, against political correctness.
This shows an escalation of events.
The conflict is rapidly increasing.
The Euro-German Schulz, the President of the European Parliament, the MP for the SPD, the only one who allegedly does not even have a high school diploma in the European Parliament - yes, this is the one about which Berlusconi in the EU Parliament said that he could play a guard in the concentration camp from the minute - has shown himself, as he has done many times before.
It seems, especially under the impression of recent statements by German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Note that, with the exception of some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the statesmen of the countries that were victims of Nazism are appalled.
What happened to the Germans?
With those rich, successful, solid Germans?
Who for years have tried, at least externally, to deal with their terrible past as an aggressor and murderer of millions?
Are those right who say that the devil of aggression, superiority and violence is sown in the soul of Germany?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he stopped with all his might the attempts of the Grand Germans to control the whole center of Europe?
When did he say that the German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When he was removed, preparations for the First World War began.
The idea of a Greater Germany, which led the Germans and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, has probably returned in a different form.
After the attempt of the Marxists to dominate the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the GDR, a new German ideology began to develop in Germany on the basis of, for example, ecology, which was, by the way, one of the main ideological teachings of Nazism.
I would say sunny.
The German elites had long resisted the rise of German nationalism, so they left all those anti-Atom fighters, enthusiasts looking for paradise for all, quietly supported the old imperial and Nazi slogan Our Forest Must Live.
In order to satisfy the restless young people who everywhere want to do something different and better, they fully sided with the fighters against the warming of the planet, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that in this stream there is also a strongly anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slavic stream that considers all Slavs as difficult to recruit - since the time of Karl Marx, who, after the parents of the Jews, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as recent statements by Schulz and German ministers openly threatening the disobedient Eastern states show, the idea of a leadership Germany.
Which you have to listen to without hesitation.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And if we mix in the fact that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And behind this, as always, is the capital, especially the German capital, to which it suits, and which is due to the fact that Germany, in fact, through the banks and the Union, controls most of the states of Europe.
The pseudo-sunflowers first led the Germans into the swamps of environmentalism and multiculturalism, and today they have brought home perhaps millions of Muslims.
Who, lured by the siren sounds, soon stumble upon a wall of reality that Merkel does not want to see, and begin to riot.
Germany can only once again threaten its neighbors with force, again it can part of its population - but, it seems, an ever smaller part - ideologically delirious, but in the end reality will catch up with it as always.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim hostels are on fire.
What will the German government do when the German public protests against the incoming Islamists break out?
Will Muslims living in Germany for a long time come to their aid, but certainly not assimilated in such a way as to adopt local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists, and Germans follow in fear the Islamization of their country?
What will it do to the Germans, and to Germany in general, when people rise up who will loudly and publicly protest against the new Euro-superman to the Muslim?
Germany has simply changed.
The conflict, which has been provoked in Europe by the support of a sunflower ideology, i.e. an elitist and essentially totalitarian ideology, and its insatiable banks, is growing.
And because of the unabashed treatment of the disobedient democratic Germans and all the inferior and disobedient eastern neighbours, this cannot turn out well.
Finishing tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of sneaky sellers: scare them to death.
Just knock and a sturdy knocker will come at you in a way that the weaker nature may not be able to stand.
He will give you life, and He will give you life, and He will give you life, and He will give you life, and He will give you life.
Perhaps it is a pity that the talking knocker can not be bought even in reality.
It would be nice to have a lot of trash and trash out there too.
Oxalis corniculata (Oxalis corniculata).
A tiny weed that tolerates dry environments.
And so it is between the outdoor tiles near my residence.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which belongs to the expansive weeds, but visually creates a nice impression when it comes to flowering.
It is located between the outdoor tiles.
She's erratic, she's doing well in our garden.
She likes a drier environment, she is easily adaptable, modest and unpretentious.
Although it creates leaves with a chaotic composition, it is worth observing and photographing it further.

The Brazilian pediatric company SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to convey to women the importance of good nutrition when breastfeeding using images of babies sucking from their breasts painted with images of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates that provide infants with all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the excess of energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily caloric intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure mothers should follow.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually influenced the genetic make-up of their babies and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively affected the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates, although Nine's is trying to take the lead on Today Show
The flight of Karel Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to cover the cost of the consequences of the liberal leadership leak failed to create a sufficient increase in ratings for Today.
Nine's morning show aired from the national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, is stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This tyranny of distance didn’t seem to matter so much to Aussie TV viewers, as it recorded an average of 397,000 viewers in five capitals compared to Today’s 330,000 viewers.
Today saw a smaller increase in its ranking compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their number was only up from last Thursday (343,000).
Today has been filling the gap on Sunrise in recent months.
In August, there were an average of 318,000 in Today compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise averaged 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting more than just parliament this morning, friends!
Karl and Lisa are doing well, thank you for asking!

The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 words with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
A new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the seaside part of New Zealand has an average of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson himself could pull off a TV hit without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result says a clear "yes."
The X Factor by Seven kept a strong 1,136 million viewers, beating The Block (838,000) and the TBL Families (726,000) to the mark.
Seven recorded mixed ratings on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour of Andrew O’Keefe’s new television quiz show (from 5 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.) averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 5:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.) jumped to 623,000 viewers—enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire’s Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers and the second half an incredible 720,000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
With The Chase Australia's second-night ranking dropping, Nine will be confident that the Hot Seat at 5:30 p.m. will ultimately win.
The Chase Australia was replaced by Million Dollar Minute, which failed to beat McGuire's show.

Three in the finals agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who will he choose?
The secret is revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently found out who will win the Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood arrives with at Bachelor's is shrouded in an unfathomable secret.
And the three girls who stay standing will definitely not reveal who is the right one, who will eventually get a rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before there were only two left, they inadvertently told us who would win.
Sam Wood holds his tongue until Thursday's final
All three women lyrically praised Wood for being the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons to want to be his partner.
In any case, when asked, "If not, which one will get Wood's final flower?", their answers could act as a spoiler as to who will win Bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one that would be best suited to Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared an easy relationship since one day.
“From the moment I walked into the house and observed Sarah and Sam’s energy, I felt they were quite compatible and I still think so during the course,” Jeavons-Fellows says.
"Sarah is a really earthy woman, she's a lot of fun," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
Together they are good and pleasant.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood could make a great couple.
For her, she claims that during his last visits at home, she realized that Wood could be "the one."
“As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was no longer just a game – I opened my heart to him now.”
I asked her who Wood would choose if not her, and she looked mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I like both girls equally - it's between Snezena and Lana indecisively.
The Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday at 7.30 on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several opportunities to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after his move to the United States and a lot of teams questioned him after his great start to training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul, and it seems like a sensible decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which was made by the conversion of the Australian rugby league during the first pitch kick in Tuesday's 20-3 win at Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and cast him in the game after the injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula also continued to be honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of chewing on the newcomers in front of the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a press conference after the match.
49ers reporter Cam Inman said Hayne also received encouragement from special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the mistake and only care about the next game.
In the first quarter against the Minnesota Vikings, Jarryd Hayne made a mistake.
It certainly wasn’t the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club had hoped for in his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught swearing when he left the field by mistake and later told the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 a worse start to his NFL career.
"It happens, you just focus on the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne likened the embarrassment to his original debut in 2007, when a recording in his own goal territory led to the Queensland trio.
Overall, it was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne posted a photo with fans holding the Australian flag after the game on his own Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia’s richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested while pointing guns at a Siberian runway.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated, and his democratic efforts curtailed.
The <0xC3><0x9A>S stood up for emigrants who demanded compensation for their property.
The couple emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, it was no longer possible to return the property, so the couple turned to the state for compensation under the Extrajudicial Rehabilitation Act.
The court first awarded them the required amount, i.e. over CZK 2.8 million, but the appeal court changed their claim by awarding them only less than CZK 90,000, referring to the fact that the amount of compensation is determined according to the price regulations of 1991.
The emigrants were defended by the Supreme Court and the amount originally claimed was attached to them.
However, the Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, turned to the <0xC3><0x9A>S with a complaint.
In the meantime, there has been such a change in social and economic conditions that the compensation granted under the legislation in force at that time - even if it was a compensation adequate in relation to the seized property - now reaches only a fraction of the value of the property.
"This cannot be a burden for the by-parties as in the restitution of entitled persons who have been claiming their rights since at least 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to claim compensation earlier," Judge Rapporteur Jaroslav Fenyk explained why the <0xC3><0x9A>S took the side of the emigrants.
"The <0xC3><0x9A>S has repeatedly called for the general courts to proceed in restitution cases in such a way that any inconsistencies are not interpreted to the detriment of the entitled persons and that the purpose of restitution legislation, i.e. compensation for property damage caused by acts of the former totalitarian state, is always achieved," the judge added.
Radka Fi<0xC5><0xA1>arová will play Evita in the musical Studio DVA.
Radka Fi<0xC5><0xA1>arová, by the way, became the world’s youngest Evita when, in 1998, in her twenties, she played the role of the wife of the Argentine dictator Eva Per<0xC3><0xB3>n in the first Czech production of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice at the Spiral Theatre in Prague.
Returning to the same role, he says, "To this day, Evita's intensity hasn't matched the power of the show."
Evita is not only an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
She was recommended for the role of First Lady of Argentina by Monika Absolon.
I saw Moncha in Evita three times and it was definitely inspiring for me.
All of a sudden, I saw a whole new concept.
I’m a big fan of the modern style, but this one is just perfect.
"The directorship of Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Sokol is original, light and contemporary," Fi<0xC5><0xA1>arová notes.
The imaginary handover of the musical scepter between the two singers will take place at Monika Absolonová’s Birthday Concert on September 27 at 7 pm at the Studio DVA Theatre.
The evening will culminate with songs from the musical Evita.
The experience will certainly include a joint duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Calm Your Cry, Argentina!).
In a limited number of performances, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Sokol will also take his place as President of Per<0xC3><0xB3>n during the filming of Karl Roden’s film.
Due to public interest, additional dates were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech production of the world musical Evita is presented by Studio DVA in cooperation with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Sokol was originally directed by Monika Absolonová.
Karel Roden appears alongside her as President Per<0xC3><0xB3>n and as Che Peter Strená<0xC4><0x8D>ik.
Legendary songs by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Czech lyrics by Michael Prost<0xC4><0x9B>jovsk<0xC3><0xBD> are performed by a live orchestra led by Kry<0xC5><0xA1>tof Marek, who participated in the first performance in the Spiral Theatre.
4 killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd of protesters against a draft of a new state constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a leading district officer, said more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside the police station and some threw stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr Dhakal said police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known for their ability to kill but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
The clash was the latest in a week of violent demonstrations across the southern plain of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have established a new province under the proposed new constitution, and has softened their political influence.
Other demonstrations in western Nepal have also been recorded by the Tharus ethnic group, which is calling for the creation of its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, including 11 police officers.
when the four main political parties signed the agreement on the division of the country into provinces — a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers this week in Kathmandu voted on a provision of the draft constitution, and officials say the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We definitely can't panic right now.
After the loss on the ice of the championship Litv<0xC3><0xAD>nov you did not manage even a home duel with the hockey players of Sparta (3:5).
Aren’t you worried about a similarly disastrous entry into the extraleague as you were a year ago?
I hope nothing like this happens again.

NHC Predicts 60 Percent Probability of Cyclone South of Cape Verde
A wide low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of Cape Verde’s southernmost islands has a 60 percent chance of creating a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system about halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of forming a tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, the Miami-based weather forecaster added.
Google has launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has announced that it is launching a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help the thousands of refugees who have flooded European countries fleeing war-torn and poor countries.
Google announced this on its blog in a very unusual way.
Rita Masoud, a Google employee, published the report on her blog based on personal experience when she fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven.
“We traveled on many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear,” Masoud said.
I was lucky.
But with the worsening immigration crisis in Europe, more and more families like mine are willing to help.
All contributions will be distributed among 4 non-profit organizations helping refugees and immigrants: Médecins Sans Fronti<0xC3><0xA8>res, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would double all contributions made through Google.com/refugeerelief to $5.5 million.
Europe is facing the largest wave of refugees since World War II, most of them coming from Syria, tossed around by a four-year war that has driven four million people out this year alone.
Many people are fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For Slightly Obese Diabetics, Weight Loss Surgery Could Be Helpful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is too early to say whether mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who are given non-surgical treatment.
“The mortality data takes a long time to show,” says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial for the new JAMA surgery study.
Surgery for weight loss, bariatric surgery use different methods to shrink the stomach.
Reducing hunger and limiting the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the research was done on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
The BMI, which measures the weight-to-height ratio, is considered normal at values between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates overweight and people over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from a 2007 study that looked at two types of bariatric surgery — gastric bypass surgery and gastrectomy — in the treatment of type 3 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The average BMI among those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year, according to the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who were not given surgical treatment for diabetes remained roughly the same at 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was completely resolved in 36 percent and partially in 28 cases.
In the drug-treated group, for comparison, diabetes was completely resolved in only 1 percent and partially only in about 2 percent of patients.
In addition, control of blood pressure, triglycerides, and “bad” LDL cholesterol was shown to be “generally better in the surgical group,” the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient’s hemoglobin A1c levels in the blood, which reflect ongoing blood sugar levels in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers said.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the drug-treated group, however, this value remained at about 8 percent.
But this better “glycemic control” — which is reflected in better hemoglobin A1c levels — did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent versus 2.1 percent), and were more likely to be in remission of diabetes (46.9 versus 16.7 percent).
While the new study shows no improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden where they found that surgery leads to longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had about a 29 percent greater chance of survival over the next 15 years, compared to the group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no improvement in survival among post-surgery patients, according to Blackstone, this is a reassuring result for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
“It is here that this work is critical, because it states that surgery is safer in the lower BMI group,” without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone also argues that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously after a patient’s BMI drops between 27 and 30.
“I think we’ve waited too long to let people know the gravity of the situation,” he says.
I think that once you accumulate these genetic changes that firmly connect their bodies to obesity and diabetes, the way back is already really hard.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to accommodate all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to the violence in the country.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He argued that under the current circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to resolve the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“Taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about long-term solutions to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries,” he said.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killings in their countries.
We must limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In addressing the issues of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the charges against George W. Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack, claiming that “the violent US response triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sincere condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent path.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have ingested a sanitation product in the last 4 years
Toxicology centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under 12 who ingested a highly alcoholic sanitation agent, according to a toxicology center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Toxicology Center of Georgia, the number of ingestion of sanitation products in children under 12 years of age that were reported to poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children are getting these products more often, and unfortunately, there’s a percentage of children who have to be taken to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
Some kids drink the sanitizer on purpose, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge on social media.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking a sanitizer because of a cheap fuss.
The teenagers reportedly mixed a sanitizer with mouthwash containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted by the attractive smell of the remedy.
“Children don’t think it’s going to hurt them,” Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (sanitary) remedies are those that are perfumed.
There are sanitary products with the smell of strawberries, grapefruit or oranges, which are very tempting for children.
The remedy contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, several arches can mean alcohol poisoning.
“This is highly concentrated alcohol,” Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the University of Kansas Hospital Toxicology Control Center, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
You wouldn’t leave a glass of whiskey lying around, either, but people leave these sanitary products outside, and when children get to them, it’s a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently ate up to four tablespoons of strawberry-scented sanitizer at school and was rushed to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold for adult drunkenness, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who took care of her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah uttered indistinct words and was unable to walk after arriving at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children’s hospital for any signs of brain trauma as the girl fell and hit her head due to alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or arrange for sanitation to be out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitation products have been associated with death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after ingesting a sanitizer that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Doctors believed that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year students in northern New York planned to poison their “evil” teachers by distributing antibacterial products around the room, according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitary means and forbade their presence in the room.
The police considered the aborted plan an "innocent chatter," and referred to the discipline of the school district,
Rumor: No Disagreement in Celtic Team
Griffiths downplays the Celtic mismatch talk, while Deila admits the Hoops are in the wrong place, but he turns it around again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against an attack on Neilson, and Warburton is concerned that the new reinforcements from January will disrupt the team's unity.
Dons increase their lead over Celtic by 5 points
The first-half penalty by ADAM Rooney secured Aberdeen a close win over Hamilton in Pittodrie, giving Dons a five-point lead between himself and Celtic.
Griffiths Denies Talks of Disagreement
This situation has sparked rumours of discord in Celtic, which have been denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his teammates are not working under any pressure from increased supervision in preparation for a match with the leaders of the Dutch league.
I don’t think we feel pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of Scottish title rivalry bores the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international Ronald de Boer say Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic – as there is no rivalry between them over the title.
De Boer, who is currently Ajax’s ambassador, says: “In the Netherlands, they no longer show the best of Celtic’s matches, and why?”
Because the Rangers aren't there anymore.
The people here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
He's talking about the old firm.
They talk about both teams together and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension at Old Firm matches, and not only people from Scotland are watching these games.
I turn things back to the good, Deila commits.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic is a bit of a wimp, but the Norwegian boss has pledged to turn things around.
Malm<0xC3><0xB6>'s defeat and subsequent Champions League relegation were quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now stands at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "Celtic has already experienced bad times and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about the current events.
We're in exactly the same situation - but we have to move on.
We really, really need Celtic’s support because it makes the players a lot better.
Now it is very important to stay together.
Warburton concerned about January reinforcements
Despite comments that appeared a few weeks ago that suggested he had already identified some of his January goals, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is concerned about a large buy-in of reinforcements and insists he doesn’t want to disrupt the Ibrox team’s unity.
The former Brentford boss says: “The January transfer window is very different from the summer one.”
Players who come in the summer have an entire pre-season period to settle in, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes more damage occurs by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Celtic Micha's transfer target suggests retirement
Swansea Micha's attacker, who was linked to Celtic in the transfer window, suggested he could retire after his contract with Swansea expires.
The 20-year-old has been suffering from ankle problems for two years and has been unable to find his way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts to fight SFA over comments against Neilson
The Hearts led 2–1 when Paterson was sent to the dressing room and eventually lost 3–2, but the red card on this defender was later rescinded – this is the third red card issued by the referee Collum to be recalled.
Neilson says, “I didn’t question integrity, I didn’t comment on performance.”
Griffiths agrees to avoid Tynecastle
Stubborn Hibbe was severely reprimanded after admitting to singing a song with lyrics aimed at former Hearts player Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was an intense moment," the attacker said, adding: "I can safely say I will not return to Tynecastle unless it's in a Celtic jersey."
Tannadice Council believes in Dundee United's management - Donelly
Simon Donelly insists that the Dundee United board still believes in remedying the situation with the current management of the team - but admits that the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare the boys for action again,” Donnelly said.
McInnes likes for 'ugly victory' against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to hold on desperately to the Hamilton Accies to secure their seventh league win in a row and a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty.
McInnes states, "There is no team that has won anything, be it cups or leagues, without winning this type of match."
Scotland’s unemployment rate remains unchanged, while the UK’s overall unemployment rate is rising
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland’s unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above that of the UK (5.5 per cent), data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over a three-month period, with the number of workers now stopping at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent during the quarter – a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Scotland’s Secretary of State David Mundell said: “The government’s long-term plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy.
It is almost exactly one year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvement in the labour market and Scottish employment has been growing while unemployment has been falling.
Why I witnessed the execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I'll be watching the man's death.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in a viewing gallery in the death chamber of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, and I'll see Richard Glossip executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four officials to witness his death.
I first received the invitation in January through my best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day draws near, I begin to fear it.
So why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way for me to tell you the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and because there are often more requests than vacancies, a morbid lottery is conducted to decide who gets elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will watch the entire execution impartially.
I can't do that.
I’ll be sitting next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and I’ve forged a special bond with him through months of phone calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visits.
I like that kid.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a notebook and I won't be able to record what I see.
I’ll just have to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the breeder as he likes, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "she could have formulated it better," but she still thinks that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell a story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a journalist from the Huffington Post, will be at my side.
To learn more about the case, please listen to a series of podcasts I’ve created.
I'm not going to go into all the details here again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would have made him guilty of accessory to a felony.
But I do believe there's a good chance he's innocent of murder.
I strongly believe that sufficient evidence has not been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, execution is wrong.
And it is from this perspective that I will follow his death.
I can't say I'm going to be really objective.
You can contact other journalists for this purpose.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the person I love die an unnecessary death.
Man escapes Canning River after police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after freeing the man from the Canning River.
A man from Petrh's bet to run away to the police didn't come out after getting into shallow muddy water just feet away from a policeman who was trying to talk him into coming back to shore.
Police from Canning Vale were called in during an incident crossing into Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping across the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He was standing in the water saying, 'I'm not going out, just come get me,'" Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want to get his uniform wet, so he tried a safer tactic, police negotiation."
"People sometimes try to do funny things when they're on the run," Castledine said.
Football champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into a ditch to avoid a bus and tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were in vain, but he inspired the locals to start planning Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody Claims Organizers Tried to Spy on Him and Threatens to End Races
Peeter Moody has accused Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy into his stable last year and has threatened to stop racing immediately.
He focused on the organisers and the Integrity Department of Racing Victoria and based himself on the belief that they had a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai’s late-scratch maintenance on the day of the race, which was the last straw for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation when it came to Lidar’s positive cobalt swab, which he could not explain.
He bit his tongue about the espionage charge for 18 months and didn’t want it to look like “dry grapes.”
“I didn’t want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it all comes out at once,” Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and get a good night's sleep.
I want to walk with my head up and make the owners think I'm doing the best I can for them.
If they start to think otherwise, then I shouldn’t be a coach anymore.
I'd have to consider what I'm doing with my license after that.
Earlier, Moody released a bombshell in an interview with racing.com that the department's integrity had tried to spy on him.
“Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man – whom I will name when asked – and offering him a job in my stables for finding out about things being done in my stables,” Moody told Racing.com.
Of course they thought I was a fraud.
If this is the case, everyone should show their information, because in an attempt to catch me they completely burned out.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I think this is becoming a personal matter?
Will the RVL grow a few balls and arrange for people outside the coaching position to take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I really that bad for the industry?
Maybe the people here think so.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will give them material to think about.
But I've gotten to the point where I don't care anymore, and I'm sad.
It really made me sad.
I will press upon them, and I will transfer the burden upon them, that they may make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
Coach frustration levels have risen with long-running cobalt investigations including Lidari, and recent scratches have given him the feeling that he "could have his license on the table for hours."
Mood, best known for preparing the undefeated Black Caviar champion, called the race-day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a horse's feet were treated with clay or mud, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for that,” he said.
Someone on my team accidentally applied mud to his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it did.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for the treatment of compresses on the day of the race, for which the organizers have already opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobram driver who escaped was arrested
Police arrested a man who hit a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend and left after a collision.
The cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley main road on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorcyclist left without stopping to help the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalie confessed to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with non-stop in the event of an accident, failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm head coach Craig Bellamy strikes back at rivals over wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, the Melbourne Storm coach, criticized his players' interventions as "setting a plan" for the two NRL's favorite premiership.
Trent Robinson, the coach of Sydney Roosters, said the referees allowed Storm players to "stake" his players during Storm's controversial victory in the qualifier final in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, Brisbane Broncos coach, made a slightly veiled comment on Strorm after his team won the North Queensland Cowboys qualifier final on Saturday night when he called the game a "show" of the rugby league and said two Queenslanders were not "too big" for wrestling.
Bellamy defended his players' interventions and said they focused on "contact" during them.
Bellamy added that this situation has boosted his confidence as his team has been criticised by two head coaches, which may mean they fear defeat from the Storm team.
“It’s still coming – I don’t remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that in the last year we have not changed anything about our defensive system and techniques, in the last weeks we have only put emphasis on contact during interventions, and this has meant a turnaround for us.
Trent has been here for three years and obviously he is training a great team, so he is probably not used to losing, which could have been a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how things like that always come in this year's part.
Bellamy devalued Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's St George-Illawarra Dragons team won the 2010 Premiership by playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was just as exciting as ours. It was just as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George was criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn’t care.
But now he has a team that can play a style of play that he finds repulsive, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
That's the kind of football you'd want to play if you had that kind of player.
He said this in 2010 and now wants all teams to play his style of football – but not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can’t play that style.
It makes me feel more confident because they say things like that because they're worried about the game against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed to the fact that there were more goals scored in the Storm vs. Roosters game than in the Broncos vs. Cowboys game.
The Broncos game was probably good, I didn't see it, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two more attempts, but is it exciting football?
Or are breaks and non-scoring experiments interesting?
I think they are agendas.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet again at some stage.
Storm have a break this weekend and have won the right to host either the North Queensland Cownboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary finals next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from the morning of next Tuesday.
Serbian man gets $200,000 bail for drug charges
A man who faced a possible life sentence for possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled from Queensland was given a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month by federal police looking for 100 kilograms of drugs from the Solay yacht, which arrived from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was spotted meeting with the accused in the port during the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in the Toyota Echo.
Despite facing a potential life sentence for possessing commercial grade cocaine, Maksimovice’s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he owned the entire quantity and that he could have been in the cafe completely by accident and innocently.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan believed Maksimovic would have fled.
It has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court Wednesday.
In the Crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
Maksimovice’s mother and stepfather jointly offered bail of $200,000 for his release.
"After reading the sworn statements of both persons, it is clear that the deposit of $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
Their efforts alone were clearly insufficient, as the accused did not appear in court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the condition that he give up both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily and observe the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl’s phone to lure pedophiles into sending pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to get photos of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg picked up the girl's phone while she was sleeping, then logged into her online chat, where he had a bunch of indecent photos of the children sent to him by another user.
The girl then woke up and found that she was missing her phone and then found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She went through it, and before she alerted her mother, she found some disturbing news.
The police got involved and saw five photos, then the analytical computers found the address and found "disturbing" searches on the site using terms to search for naughty pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to police officers that his reason was to “bring pedophiles” online before “pretending to be a police officer and scaring them off.”
Eilidh Robertson, a tax attorney, told Dundee Sheriff Court: “He said it’s an addiction — he’s addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he searched the computer, but claimed that he just wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare off pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send more.
According to him, he did it to lure them
He claims he was drunk and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on her phone, she called her mother, shivering and crying.
She saw the obscene images on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interrogated and talked about how the defendant was using her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, a resident of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to filing a lawsuit for accepting or providing inappropriate images of children on June 14 last year, violated bail conditions on January 25 and failed to appear in court on March 24 this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the sex offenders list because he could argue that there was “no underlying sexual subtext” in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October because of reports from social workers.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but was held in custody prior to hearing about other unsolved cases.
He was placed on a list of sex offenders prior to the date of his conviction.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe makes bad speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell earlier this year on the steps leading to the podium.
He was not injured, but a video of his fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also marred by claims by opposition lawmakers that they had received anonymous death threats that warned them against firing Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, he was booed and provoked during his State of the Union speech in parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The chairman of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) parliamentary club, Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to block Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The report comes from a number that does not appear, but is called 'death,'" he told reporters after Mr Mugabe's speech.
He warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in parliament and once they step out of parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, had "concerns" about threats against MPs.
Hewlett-Packard plans to cut up to 30,000 jobs.
Hewlett-Packard will cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save the cost of its business services business.
Later this year, HP will split into two listed companies and separate its PC and printer business from its faster-growing business hardware and services operations.
The expected job cuts will result in a change of about $2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring activities will allow us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP CEO and Chairman of the Board, who will lead the unit after the split.
“The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP is today and will have a broad and extensive portfolio of stores that will help businesses transition to a new style of business,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving demands of our customers around the world.
Following the company’s announcement, Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of more than $50 billion and “will be focused on providing unrivalled integrated technology solutions” to companies.
The company was founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, a manufacturer of electrical equipment whose garage in Palo Alto was nicknamed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone a massive reorganization to handle the transition from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest tech companies in America, is the latest in a sector based on the belief that a narrowly specialized company performs better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team-mates must catch injured Jack Wilshere outside Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed to Wilshere that it's still only September, and if his rehabilitation goes as planned, there's no reason not to play again at Christmas.
This best-case scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least four more English games and, from the point of view of history, his involvement in the next Summer European Championship is clearly uncertain.
A great pity of this latest problem is that Wilshere finished last season strong after an ankle injury and then got back into his former form during the pre-season.
“This kind of injury doesn’t threaten your career,” Wenger said.
It is a wound that requires healing.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injuries he'd suffered before.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative risk of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant pattern.
A survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. records 23 different injuries to Wilsher since he made his game debut six years ago.
During the last five years he played only in 65 league games of Arsenal from a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons from 2007–08 he was one of the two Premier League clubs to lose the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the vicious circle, but Arsenal believe that the improvement in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
“Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win the competition,” Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will, and he will have the career he deserves.
Arsenal start their Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb in matches against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur the next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Beller<0xC3><0xAD>n and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, that is, Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to join.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Montreal’s Theo Walcott.
“I try to keep my balance and let the players who need it breathe,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite to advance from Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation for being the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
They were also undefeated in a total of 41 games after keeping their campaign "undefeated" last season.
The stadium shook on Wednesday night with a 3.2-magnitude earthquake.
This was the tenth time this year in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks Arsenal have learned from last season’s Champions League capitulation against Monaco, and he has little hope of leading the club to its first European Cup victory.
"This deployment is tremendous," Wenger says.
This has never happened to Arsenal.
In 2006 we were very close, but on the other hand I have to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The lack of similar depictions in various shows is striking, especially given the need for men to open up more desperate than ever when it comes to suicides among young men under 15.
In 2013, it was the single largest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address this issue, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, which aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when needed.
At the heart of this struggle lies friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a “healthy mood,” their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends represents half the chance of experiencing mental health problems.
But for friendship to work, of course, it must first be attainable.
In this social media communication with an emphasis on style rather than message content, an immediate response is often preferred over meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful has doubled, even though we are more isolated in reality.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values – our personal desire for growth and friendship – that have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and game developer recently explained, money really doesn’t buy more happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was the source of this idea for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities that shone through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent sacrifice, moments of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross's desire for Rachel, all stem from the knowledge that yes, men can identify with it too, even though they usually keep their feelings to themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me: “My role as a listener of people who feel depressed or suicidal has really confirmed to me that even the smallest of friendly interactions can make a difference.”
Men who contact us often feel the inability to communicate with friends.
The old adage of “deal with it” is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems.
Friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer a longer-term compensation mechanism.
It highlights the small moments in a man's friendship.
As for my task, the outsider status on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term support must come from closer, from a network of friends and family.
So if you are going to the Comedy Central Comedy Fest this weekend, why not take your friends for a drink in Central Perk, where the interior will be completely redesigned for the occasion of the celebration.
Or if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile at them and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship can make.
Friends will be aired on Comedy Central from start to finish – 236 episodes in total – for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG sweep Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring a goal against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored in his Champions League debut, helping PSG beat Sweden's Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the news of the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's match, and Paris Saint-Germain began their Champions League journey with a final comfortable 2-0 win against Malmo at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored the goal less than four minutes after his Champions League debut, and this PSG player sent the French champions to win, but then threw away a few chances until they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored the goal with his head in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, which is why the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they focus not only on qualifying for the knockout rounds, but on improving their way to the quarterfinals, which they recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But although they scored three points, it was not the classic performance of Laurent Blanc and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was prodigal in front of the goal and was later replaced against his home team and the club where he began his illustrious career in 1999.
“In the Champions League, it’s not easy to win outside or at home, so winning 2-0 is a problem for our opponents and looking comfortable on the defensive is a good start, although there are things that we will need to improve as the season progresses,” Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I regret that we didn’t score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after an injury as one of three PSG team changes at home to win a 2-2 draw this weekend with Bordeaux in the Ligue 1, but was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine winger was labelled as the man who would take PSG in Europe to a new level after the Manchester United transfer last month, and showed why when he ran on Marco Verratti’s pass to defend Malm and sent the ball behind Johan Wilanda’s back to the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected it to kick-start PSG’s spectacular victory, they must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-offs and reached this stage, started with 9 internationals in the basic line-up and five defenders and two drawn midfielders were a heavy opponent.
But apart from the Nikola Djurdjica shot, which just narrowly missed the distant corner of Kevin Trapp’s goal in the 34th minute, they didn’t offer much in the attack.
Instead, PSG themselves profited from the attack with poor passes and a lousy finish, which was not good even from Ibrahimovic, who could not shoot even five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his missile arrived in the net shortly after the start of the second half of Cavani.
However, he turned out to be much more suitable when it came to preparing chances for his teammates and it was from his pass that Di Maria sent a turntable shot that ended up in Wiland’s goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of play thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayan sent a header for the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic scored him after passing from Maxwell's left wing.
This ended all Malm's thoughts about the possibility that they could benefit from the match, and only Wiland's excellent close-quarters intervention thwarted David Luiz's hopes, and the score remained unchanged even when the goal of Ezequiel Lavezzi was unrecognised at the end of the match.
Malmo team manager Age Hareide admitted that PSG were a class above his team, Nor said: "Our last Champions League game took place in December last year."
Since then, we have played only the Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
Qualifying is not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
It was an amazing match for them.
Glencore makes $2.5 billion in stock sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which was hit by a collapse in commodity prices, made $2.5 billion in stock sales on Wednesday as part of its extensive debt-reduction plan.
Glencore said in a statement that it had sold about <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion worth of new shares to pay off the debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is grappling with falling commodity prices as China’s economic slowdown dampens demand and ignites sparks of destruction across markets.
Rights issues sent Glencore stock prices to the top of the London stock market in early morning trading on Wednesday.
Shares jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore revealed last week that the $2.5 billion share sale is part of broader plans to reduce their $30 billion debt, which has accumulated by about a third.
The company sold the new shares at a price of 123 pence per share, marking a 2.4 percent discount on Tuesday's closing price.
They disposed of 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 percent per group.
Concerns about prolonging China’s slowdown have cut the price of iron ore by nearly half, and coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
White House Confirms Xi Jinping Visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States at the end of the month, the White House said in a statement on Tuesday.
President Xi’s first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response to Barack Obama’s visit to Beijing, where the president visited in November, the report said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, to a state dinner after the talks.
“President Xi’s visit represents an opportunity to strengthen the U.S.-China relationship and encourages cooperation to address issues of international, regional, and common interest, and is an opportunity for constructive debate on the differences between the two countries,” the report said.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is due to visit Seattle, where he will meet with several U.S. technical leaders on his way to Washington and then continue to New York for a U.N. meeting in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyberespionage and its growing aggression in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis has ravaged the Schengen area.
An emergency flare set off by Germany has far from sealed off the European crew, but is already forcing the ship to change course, the French daily Le Figaro reported.
The European Union decided on Monday to tackle the refugee problem first: it would rather systematically categorize migrants and asylum seekers as soon as they enter the old continent - especially in Greece - than argue about the future distribution of refugees by quota on the basis of an increasingly distant reality.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the EU’s 28 countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, member states’ interior ministers have changed their priority.
Before taking care of the final destination of the refugees, it is first necessary to filter those who arrive today and solve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is essential for managing migration," the text said in Brussels on Monday.
After the common currency crisis, the EU finds itself at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its resolve and increases the pressure.
It restores border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the flow of those seeking asylum in that country.
The Central Power makes it clear that no free movement in Europe is possible without it.
As evidence, Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering it, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary did this a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are permissible under the Schengen rules.
It is a domino effect, but it can also be seen by the blind.
A key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry checks in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already entered the hinterland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German counterpart Thomas de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re discussed it intensively during a private conversation with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is being implemented with rigor.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two-thirds of newly arrived refugees have already been registered and identified with fingerprinting.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point on its territory because it fears more than others that camps at its expense will not remain on its shoulders.
The real black hole is Greece.
More than 200,000 people have landed on its islands off the Turkish coast this year, more than twice as many as have recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after passing through overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge gaping hole.
Athens, still in financial turmoil and awaiting a new government, has folded its hands in the lap.
This is the starting point for the Balkan journey and is now a source of common concern for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission has promised to introduce checkpoints as soon as possible, but has not given any number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece apply to the whole of Europe," EU interior ministers agreed on Monday to mobilise on that front.
It is therefore a matter of deploying the European border control agency Frontex’s intervention teams in the country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity to receive asylum seekers and strengthen its surveillance of the islands.
"Adequate financial resources will be needed," warns the text submitted to ministers for approval.
From a legal point of view, Athens will continue to have the last word.
The question of creating real European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is getting closer to it.
The new emergency situation of the Group of Twenty-eight has, in any case, relegated the issue of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees, which was established at the beginning of the year by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament, and which was strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They see it as an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, was retained on Monday in a text approved by a majority of the twenty-eight.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm promise involves the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which was already agreed in June during a hectic EU summit, concludes Le Figaro.
Seven dead under an avalanche in the Alps, reportedly three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among seven tourists killed by an avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the authorities, the German nationality is also a woman who, as the only one of the affected eight-member group, survived.
Earlier media reports said it was a Polish woman.
A 30-year-old woman with a serious leg injury in the thigh bone was hospitalized in the city of Briancon.
The dead were mostly in their 40s, according to AFP.
"The rescue operation is over and the bodies of the victims have been taken to Briancon for identification," Pierre Besnard, prefect of the department of Hautes-Alpes, said in a statement.
The accident happened around noon in the Pelvoux mountain area below the top of the mountain D<0xC3><0xB4>me de Neige des Ecrins measuring 4015 meters.
"The sudden avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a meter high," said rescue chief Nicolas Colombani.
According to him, a huge amount of snow fell on the eight-member group at an altitude of about 3,900 meters.
The weather service did not warn of bad weather in the area today.
Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> before the match with Braga: finally the real Europe.
The coach Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> managed to pass through the Europa League to the base group with the Liberec players during his cup opening and now he is looking forward to enjoying the real Europe with the team.
At the beginning of the main stage of the competition, Slavan will welcome the finalist from 2011 Braga and, according to the coach, he wants to impose his playing style on her.
After all the nerves in the knockout fights, when every goal and every situation could knock you out on the way to the dream group, now we are there and we will play six matches.
Of course, we want to win, but we do not have to be afraid of every goal scored, we can play our tactics and we are not tied by just a double-game.
"I am very much looking forward to it and it is a real Europe, before that it was just a qualification," Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said at a press conference.
Bragu considers it a top team.
He will be very active, they have all Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good on the ball.
The opponent may be even more difficult because he does not have such a name, but at the same time he has a player in his squad who, I guess, gave Manchester three goals.
"It's an excellent unit at the level of top teams," said Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
But he doesn't consider Braga a clear favorite.
I take it we're playing at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
“I think we have shown that we are strong at our stadium, both in the domestic competition and in the preliminary rounds, and we want to confirm that,” said the coach, whose team lost only the opening Super Cup in Pilsen from eleven matches this season.
He believes that even Braze can impose his style on Liberec.
We have a team that will be strong on the ball, at the same time it is uncharacteristically disciplined for them.
They play from a 4-4-2 layout with a quick transition to the attacking phase.
"It's a very tough opponent, although we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players do it on the pitch," Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
We studied a lot of opponents in the preliminary rounds, which helped us a lot, this time we want to focus on our game, to which we also adapted the training.
"And we definitely want, even if it's going to be very difficult, to play according to our notes," he added.
Student films will dominate P<0xC3><0xAD>sek, the international festival begins.
This year, over 350 authors from 51 countries entered their works in the competition of the 15th International Festival of Student Films in P<0xC3><0xAD>sek.
Four dozen of them, sent to the final by a committee of students and teachers, will be screened from 15 to 18 October at the Porty<0xC4><0x8D> Cinema.
The best of them will be chosen by an international jury, festival spokesman Jakub Charvát said.
Each year the festival has its own special theme, which is derived from the festival jingle.
She's a detective this year.
The director of this year’s gala evenings, Richard Blumenfeld, plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre production.
"And, of course, we also have to solve the crime that was committed in our trailer this year," Charvát said.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting of student works - feature, animated and documentary films.
They will be judged by an international jury, including last year’s winner, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
The organizers of the festival, like every year, prepare an accompanying program.
Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Ruml, professional didgeridoo player Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Smeykal, turbochanson band Polet<0xC3><0xAD>me?, playful band Zrn<0xC3><0xAD> or Petra Hapková with the recital Life at the Bar.
The festival will also host two photo exhibitions.
The first one will be brought by Jana Ashenbrennerová, a graduate of the film school in P<0xC3><0xAD>sek and a holder of prestigious awards, among which there is also a World Press Photo 2014.
The second exhibition will take a closer look at the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
The silent film The Cameraman will be accompanied by Gerhard Gruber and the sand natives Brukner, Novotn<0xC3><0xBD> and Hlach in the studio of sculptor Jan Novotn<0xC3><0xBD>.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ond<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek, the patron of FAMO in P<0xC3><0xAD>sek, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are his legacy, which will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop common ties and filmmaking," the spokesman said.
The Pitching Forum, where students can meet film professionals, take part in several job auditions at the same time and get a job position, will certainly help.
The festival is associated with the establishment of the Private Higher Vocational Film School in P<0xC3><0xAD>sek.
Its founders, Vladana and Milo<0xC5><0x88> Ter<0xC4><0x8D>ovi, organized the first year in 1997.
Until the sixth year it was held once every two years.
In the event of bankruptcy, insurance companies are required to pay their clients’ claims in full.
Insurance companies should pay clients’ claims in the event of the travel agency’s bankruptcy in full.
This was decided on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies, when it approved a revised amendment to the Law on Business Conditions in Tourism.
Travel agencies will be able to replace bankruptcy insurance with a bank guarantee, according to a draft heading to the Senate.
Insurance companies do not agree with the obligation to pay clients’ claims even above the agreed limit.
The Ministry of Regional Development insists on the adjustment, argues for consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to stop insuring travel agencies against bankruptcy if the amendment goes into effect.
The proposal has also been criticized by travel agencies.
Without insurance, they will either have to leave or go abroad.
Regional Development Minister Karla <0xC5><0xA0>lechtová (for ANO) pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation are not Eurocomform.
She drew attention to this year’s decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive enough information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to determine the right limit, said <0xC5><0xA0>lechtová.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit to be feasible," said Miroslav Kalousek, vice-chairman of TOP 09.
According to him, the bank guarantee will not work, because no one will give it unlimited.
"Travel agencies will have to close down or move abroad," Kalousek warned.
Member of the Presidium of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies Tomio Okamura (SPD) disagreed with Kalousek’s concerns based on a survey among members of the Central Committee.
"Stop lobbying us insurance companies," he said.
According to him, Okamura does not consider the statements of the insurance companies to be relevant, and there is no official written statement of the insurance companies in this sense.
But they are investigating whether travel agencies will co-pay, which Okamura says is not a problem.
Jana Fischerová (ODS) also warned about the provision, referring to the opinion of the competitive Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about the lubrication of the stairs to Czech travel agencies.
According to Fischer, travel agencies will not be able to negotiate insurance.
"Consumer protection works," Fischer said.
Her motion for the removal of the disputed passage was not approved by the House.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Filip (KS<0xC4><0x8C>M) did not come with a proposal to return the draft to the committee because of the alleged violation of the Civil Code.
Philip warned about travel agencies, which, according to him, can threaten consumers.
The rapporteur of the draft, Martina Berdychová (ANO), withdrew her proposal, which would limit the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not know that insurance coverage would not cover the entire risk, in view of the ruling of the Constitutional Court.
The amendment will not initially propose a minimum insurance limit of $4 million for travel agencies offering air travel and a limit of $1 million for offices selling, for example, bus tours.
The limit will remain at 30 percent of the planned revenues from the sale of tours.
However, the insurance coverage limit will have to be such as to cover all customer claims in the event of the travel agency’s bankruptcy.
Even after the amendments, the standard stipulates that travel agencies will have to indicate which travel agency organizes the tour for the sold tours.
Travel agencies will have to provide insurance companies with, among other things, data on the economy and the number of trips before concluding the contract.
The approved amendment of the Public Administration Committee also provides for further regular information of insurance companies.
Every month, travel agents will have to provide them with data on the number of passengers and sold tours, on the total price of sold tours and on the amount of advances and sales for tours and for vouchers.
If the Ministry of Regional Development finds that the travel agency has failed to fulfil any of its legal obligations towards the insurance company, it will call on it to remedy the problem or may prohibit it from entering into new contracts in the event that the breach of the obligation could endanger the interests of customers.
The amendment is also intended to restructure the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Regional Development will determine the amount of the subsidy to the mountain service on the basis of its request, which it will apply each year until the end of April for the next year.
The application will include a report on the use of state money in the past year, a financial plan of expenditure and a outlook for the next two years.
According to the association, however, the lawmaker has not figured out what will happen if the insurance company terminates the CK contract.
It will not be allowed to organize tours and clients who bought the trip before the insurance was cancelled will lose it, according to the association.
In this case, the CC will suffer a significant loss and may even go bankrupt, although its management was in good shape.
One of the ways in which travel agencies can cope with such a situation will be to sue the state for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad, and then we will act only as agencies on our market, said the vice-chairman of the association Jan Pape<0xC5><0xBE>.
According to him, the draft amendment also contains the institute of bank guarantee, but so thoughtlessly that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, because the bank guarantee cannot sound to an unlimited amount.
In addition, according to the association, the change in the current practice is de facto unnecessary.
The whole law will have to be revised again within two years in view of the new EU directive.
A total of 942 active travel insurance companies are currently operating on the Czech market.
So far this year, only three KCs have closed their operations.
Domestic travel agencies sell annually tours worth about twenty billion CZK.
Merkel: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must work to improve humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the flow of refugees into Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after talks with German prime ministers.
At the same time, she again called for the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU among the 28 member states.
We need to do more to help the countries where refugees leave or where they stay after leaving their homeland.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will promote decent conditions in refugee camps, such as in Jordan and Lebanon, said the German chancellor, according to which such a signal could also be increased financial assistance or closer cooperation of the EU with international humanitarian organizations.
"The federal states also support the German government in promoting a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis to European countries," Merkel said.
Dietmar Woidke, the state prime minister of Brandenburg, said at a press conference that he expected real solidarity from all EU states.
The distribution of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas has long been rejected, among other things, by the Czech Republic.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke in favour of speeding up asylum proceedings in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to be able to start integrating foreigners more quickly, the Prime Minister of Brandenburg said.
According to him, most of the money that Germany spends on the care of refugees should be used for the integration of those who have a chance to obtain asylum.
More teachers will be needed for refugees to master German.
This is a great challenge for our country, but I believe that if we manage to integrate refugees, they can become a benefit for us, he said.
Matt Damon is trying to make a difference in the movie.
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity with the claim that it was not necessary behind the scenes.
During a Sunday episode of HBO's Greenlight project, the cast of the series interrupted Brown, stressing the need for alternative perspectives regarding the black protagonists in the script.
“When we talk about diversity, you’re doing it with the cast of the movie, not the cast of the show,” Damon says.
Shocked, Brown reacted indignantly and sighed, "Hoo! Wow. Okay," as the Martian commentary aired.
Damon and Brown teamed up with co-producer Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
“I’d like to appeal to people to think, whoever the director is, how they’re going to treat the character of Harmony,” Brown said at the outset.
The only black character who's a hooker who's being bagged by a white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People promoted the finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon noted that their direction "could eventually give us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disagreement with Damon’s comment.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger at the video's writing, "Matt Damon jumped into the speech of the only black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that diversity is SO WHITE that it hurts."
The tweet has garnered more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 characters since it was posted.
Damon’s comment comes at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After being killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained national prominence and pressured lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminating against people of color.
In February, the singer Prince made allusions to the movement, while featuring nominees in the Album of the Year category during the Grammy Awards.
"Albums are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The most recent leader of the Black Lives Matter movement presented a statement in response to a question from Fox News personality, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
“The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group,” the group said.
Damon was recently reported on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who were invited to visit the pope to discuss the depiction of the Catholic Church in the west.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the Pope is not clear.
American Ninja Warrior has its first winner.
Professional mountaineer and mountaineer Isaac Caldiero became the first competitor to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday, taking home $1 million.
In the competition, which just ended its seventh season, none of the competitors managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During the season finale, two men made it to the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30 second climb over a 220 m long rope.
Britten was the first to complete the climb within the set limit, becoming the first competitor to surpass the four-point finish in the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero surpassed him by a full three seconds to win the competition.
Caldiero gave an interview to E! News right after his hard-earned victory and it was recognized that he was still in shock from winning the main prize worth $ 1 million.
“It’s an amazing feeling, I’ve never made more than $10,000 a year in my life,” Isaac E! said in response to his win.
"So all of a sudden... I can't imagine what it's going to be like now."
Executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter about the course of the final and why Britten would not receive any award despite the fact that he became the first competitor to finish the track.
According to the rules, the money belongs to the one who completes the track the fastest.
“If there are more competitors on the track, the winner will be the one with the best time,” Weed said.
Even if winning the main prize would change his life, Britten is satisfied with his performance.
"I don't think he harbors resentment.
He is happy to have achieved what he has achieved.
He received a warm reception from his fans.
He's a great guy and he loves his family.
He's a hero to his children and his wife."
Geoff told me, “If there was anyone who could beat me, I’m glad it was Isaac.”
And I think if I won, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue with the eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tigers just passed the Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the Detroit tigers, the second half of the season wasn't exactly a walk in the rose garden.
Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, is in last place in the Central Division of the American League right now.
The Tigers narrowly averted their defeat when they defeated Minnesota 5–4 at Target Field on Tuesday.
The twins missed a chance to get close to the Houston Astros and grab a second wild card in the American League.
Although only for one night, for Detroit it was a return to the Z word, which was so elusive to them during the second half of the season.
“Winning is always fun and it doesn’t matter how,” said Tiger manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his offensive start and Detroit scored three times in the first two shifts and then took another in the sixth and ninth shifts.
Simon (13-9) allowed the opponent 6 1/3 shots and 3 rounds.
It was his third successful game of the last nine games.
"I want to end this year with convincing results," Simon said.
“It’s hard to get into a game when you’re often on the bench and that’s why I want to get in the game.”
Tiger batsman Victor Martinez struck three times and made two laps and his first draw point since mid-August.
For Martinez, it was the first three-point match since the last game in June, in which he hit four times in a match against the Seattle Mariners.
"He leaned into it," Ausmus said.
"He looked good in training, he fired noticeably better and he managed to bring it to the match."
With three laps at the end of the seventh shift, the Twins had the best chance of getting back in the game.
Midfielder Byron Buxton won the shift thanks to two points on the left side of the field.
Right-back Aaron Hicks scored a point with his bat set, and Simon fired Brian Dozier before being replaced by left-back Blaine Hardy.
Hardy knocked out his only rival, Mauer, and had batter Miguel Sano in front of him, who fired the ball and rounded two goals, leaving right-handed Drew VerHagen behind.
With two players on goals and a chance to draw in the second shift, VerHagen managed to send a third-place finisher over two goals.
Plouffe has already gained 27 laps over two goals this season and reigns over the league tables.
Detroit retained the ninth inning, Mauer scored two points and Bruce Rondon secured a 5–4 for the Tigers.
However, this right-hander eliminated San for three overtimes.
Detroit took advantage and scored points in the Phil Hughes game.
The Tigers gained three turnovers in their first two shifts against a retired right-hander who entered the game after more than a month's break due to inflammation of the back muscles.
"I certainly didn't imagine such a start," Hughes said, "but during the third shift I felt I was doing better pitching."
After resisting the onslaught in the first shift, Hughes dropped one point to second-place finisher Ian Kinsler.
Two exits for the right-back J.D. Martinez brought out Victor Martinez, who was the first to circle all the finish lines.
Victor Martinez broke his 0-21 streak.
Third-place finisher Nick Castellanos followed him with a point to the right of the field and scored the next lap, but Victor Martinez was overtaken when he tried to finish third.
The Tigers added in the second shift, when pitcher James McCann and pitcher Anthony Gose scored two and one point, and the score was 3-0 on the scoreboard.
"That got us down on our knees," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it in the right place."
Hughes, who won the number of pitches, finished in third without points and was replaced by right-back A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran three targets, got six shots and four strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the right pitcher of the Tigers, ended the match with pain in his right shoulder.
He will be cared for by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's arm in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list due to stretched muscles in his shoulder since mid-August, is due to take part in Wednesday’s match.
Sanchez will be replaced by left-handed Daniel Norris, who will return after the injury and play against the Twins.
From June 30, when Norris was traded to left-hander David Price, he scores 1-1 after 4 games.
However, he has not played since August 20 due to a strained muscle.
Tigers and Twins will play their third game at Target Field on Wednesday.
The Minnesota left pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA) will face Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA).
Xi calls for opening up the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with governance reform on Tuesday.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve open policies," he said about the 16th meeting of the central group leader to deepen overall reform.
Promoting opening-up in nascent reforms will give a new impetus and vitality, as well as provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory market access, the easing of border control policies, support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and the reorganisation of the registration resident system.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and enterprises that are outside the investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through test programmes.
This step is significant because it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers it delegates to companies and make sure the firms themselves decide how to run their businesses.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to support regional growth.
In an effort to open up the state-controlled sector, more areas will be opened up to private investment.
“The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of companies that are financed from abroad and will provide them with better services,” the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a "green card", thanks to the optimization of requirements and the simplification of the application process.
Ensuring the rights of lawyers to practice and develop professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
In the Karlovy Vary Region, new beds may be created.
According to the Deputy Governor of the Karlovy Vary Region, Jakub Pánik (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), the current capacity of bed departments of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
However, there are also opportunities to expand care in the region.
For example, in the department of surgical departments, one-day surgery centers could be established, where, according to the set concept, surgical procedures would be performed that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours.
It is not yet clear in which specific hospitals the one-day surgery facilities should be.
The skin department of the Karlovy Vary hospital could, in turn, create a laser center with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the creation of an apical center that would care for patients with brain disabilities who are in a vegetative state.
Such a center should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiological-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility in the Ostrov hospital, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary Region, are the beds of follow-up care, especially the beds of the Long-Term Care (LDN), whose capacity in Nejdek is insufficient and, above all, should be closely related to acute care beds.
Part of this device should function as a rehabilitation bed and part as a classic LDN bed, recommends the concept.
As he points out, the beds of follow-up care are missing mainly in the Karlovy Vary hospital.
There you can use the abandoned buildings after centralization.
Last but not least, in the Karlovy Vary Region, social health beds with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease are absent.
There is a shortage of such beds throughout the republic, so it could also serve for other regions as the so-called Alzheimer's Center.
According to the recommendation, hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called follow-up beds, to which funds from European subsidies will be released.
"These are beds that will follow the fields of superspecialized care and will create a space for the translation of patients after surgery, for example, after cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, transplantation or other surgery," describes the regional concept of in-patient care.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
