Is there a black box in your car?
While American road designers are struggling to find the money to repair the crumbling highway network, many are beginning to see a solution in a small black box that easily fits into your car’s dashboard.
The facilities that monitor every kilometer a motorist drives, and that relay this information to the authorities, are at the heart of a controversial effort by Washington and state planning agencies to renovate the outdated system of financing America’s major roads.
The usually slow design of motorways suddenly sparked an intense debate and the emergence of various associations.
Libertarians gathered with groups of environmentalists and lobbied for the government to use these small lockers to record mileage and maybe even where you’re going — and then use that information to compile tax returns.
The tea party is horrified.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy concerns.
And while Congress cannot agree on whether to proceed, some states are waiting for nothing.
They are finding out how they can move over the next decade to a system in which the driver pays for the kilometer of road on which he is driving.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
“It’s not a matter of much choice,” said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California State Administration Association, which plans to begin tracking each California motorist’s mileage in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This technology serves this purpose.
The incentive is that the road trust fund, funded by taxes that Americans pay at gas stations, is at a bottom.
Americans are not buying as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars will run a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the past 20 years.
Due to the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise the tax even by a single cent.
“The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed a tracking device for up to 500 cars to test this kilometre-fee payment system.
"In the long run, this seems to be the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it a user fee based on the number of kilometers driven.
It’s no surprise that urban liberals like this idea, as taxes can be used to change drivers’ behaviour patterns, which can help reduce congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Californian planners look to this system when planning strategies to meet the goals set out in ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster (Pennsylvania Representative), chairman of the Transportation Committee, said he also sees it as the most functional long-term alternative.
The free-market leaders of the Reason Foundation are also inclined to the idea that drivers will pay for miles driven.
“It’s not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of strategy at Reason.
People pay for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 urged Congress to go in the direction of paying per kilometer.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project that would have included about 10,000 cars.
However, the House of Representatives rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of rural legislators representing the constituents of the population, whose daily life often means driving many kilometers for work outside the city.
However, several states and cities are moving forward on their own.
Oregon is the country’s largest experiment involving 5,000 drivers.
These drivers will soon start paying the state tax on mileage instead of the tax on gasoline.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is investigating the project.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state Departments of Transportation, along with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is studying how they can implement the change.
However, this concept does not have only supporters.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with the device, drivers were concerned that the government was able to monitor their every move.
“The Big Brother surveillance concerns and things like that were a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategy and operations management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the trial project continued, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a huge cumbersome technological infrastructure, which will inevitably expand to record daily departures and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is among the few states that are trying to find affordable technology that would allow the state to track how many miles the car drives, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
The pursuit of such technology has led some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, the company was not involved in the action to help the government in the taxation of drivers.
She wanted to break into the emerging market for statutory liability insurance, where drivers would pay based on how much they drive.
But this device, which it is testing, attracts the attention of road network designers, because it does not use GPS and supplies only a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using a modem.
“People will be more willing to go for it if you don’t keep track of their speed and their location,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
A number of major errors have occurred in some of these pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose devices with GPS or without GPS.
Or they do not have to take any equipment and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average number of kilometers driven by all the population of the state.
In other places, they hope that the cautious public will accept this concept if the device can do more, not less.
In New York City, traffic officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped to pay extra parking hour fees, provide mileage insurance, and collect data on the speed of other drivers so motorists can avoid traffic jams.
“Motorists will be willing to get involved because of the value of the benefits offered to them,” the city’s design document states.
However, some transport planners would like to know if all the discussion about paying per kilometer is not just a giant proxy problem.
Officials from the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Committee say Congress could easily solve the problem of the bankrupt Road Trust Fund by raising the gasoline tax.
A one-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other vehicles that do not consume a lot of fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
“There’s no need for radical surgery if you’re rich enough to take an aspirin,” Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Legislation and Public Affairs, said in a statement.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and a lot of other things.
Sobotka is negotiating for <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
Social democracies are crumbling, the people and the Babi<0xC5><0xA1> people are talking to each other and preparing a common course of action.
If the Social Democrats get confused within a few weeks, they will sit down at the negotiating table with perfectly coordinated partners who will put on the table a ready list of demands, including ministerial posts.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD delegates then either swallow the sour coalition grapes or nod to the fickle minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka hit for the first time after four days, when he was carrying on a wave of sympathy.
Yesterday, he failed to master the political prize and, above all, to force convicted liars to resign.
Only he is the confirmed negotiator for the party, the other team members will be allowed only after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CEC).
I apologized to the members of the gremium and now to the citizens.
Don’t lie, in your personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek said after the meeting of the top leadership of social democracy.
He said he was not in the position of first vice president.
"I will announce my decision on November 10 at the Central Election Commission," Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k <0xC5><0xA0>kromach, vice-chairman of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, and Jeron<0xC3><0xBD>m Tejc, head of the parliamentary club, said the same.
He said he was elected just two years ago.
Both MPs then said they would do everything to ensure that the 50-member <0xC4><0x8C>SSD club sounded one vote.
Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek put the crown on the absurd theatre with the sentence: "I have been a member of the CSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and I have respected the decisions of the party bodies."
That's another lie on live TV.
Or did he forget, when he called for Sobotka’s resignation and his expulsion from the negotiating team, that the August Central Election Commission had decided with 57 percent that Bohuslav Sobotka was the party’s candidate for prime minister?
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD chief, however, did not produce a powerful army of enemies until the following Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to flood the emails of 192 members of this body as well as the media with a bunch of rumors and rumors, possibly recalling the real mistakes of Sobotka’s political career.
Dirty laundry will be done powerfully, there will be hints of dark alliances between the coal baron Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala and Sobotka’s wing.
The friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential lawyer Radek Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> will be discussed.
Disputes in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will be raised.
The words of the Ostrava mayor and Sobotko’s ally Peter Kajnar are a warning: “I signed Charter 77 so that the country would not be ruled by idiots.”
If the <0xC3><0x9A>VV were to meet this weekend, the liars would probably be forced to ritually sacrifice their functions.
Traitors will sprinkle ashes on their heads and stay.
And the currently winning head of the CSSD will end up with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doktor about the problems with the Olympic Games in Sochi: Communication with the Russians is difficult
The corners of his mouth indicate a slight smile, and then he just exhales deeply: "It's challenging."
Cooperation with the organizing team of the Sochi 2014 Olympics is a bit more complicated, according to Martin Doktor.
We can forget what happened at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same," says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
Many things work more slowly and not so accurately.
It's so confusing.
In terms of invoices, they are relatively fast, in terms of providing information on essentials, not so much.
For example, for three months now, we have been asking them to tell us how the individual villages will be officially marked, so that we can do a number of things accordingly.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating the thing.
In many ways, they are still communicating.
Is there an Olympic Village?
It is no longer a catastrophic situation.
A month ago, we were walking around empty rooms.
Fortunately, the houses are still standing.
What do you mean they're empty?
Do you need a finished floor?
Just basic concrete, so that was the situation a month ago.
But they still have time.
Although there is a danger that when we arrive there on January 26 as a vanguard, there will still be a smell of glue.
And if they don't make it, so what?
Do you think President Putin would send an army there?
That's probably how it's gonna turn out.
Just make sure it's not that Olympic village = Potemkin's village.
More likely, they will not be able to adjust the paths, for example, they will not finish the details.
Maybe they'll have roads in such a state that we'll have to take our London games boots with us.
But I'm sure they'll put it together somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78, although this number changes depending on the nomination criteria.
Maybe the skaters will go in the three of them that went out.
No one can doubt the speed skater Martina Sábl<0xC3><0xAD>ková either, but otherwise it is in development.
Are you still on your way to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I'm not supposed to fly there until January 26th.
What will the houses in the Olympic village look like, we know.
We even measured some things ourselves by the metro, so as not to believe only the sketches.
We are also preparing a number of other things, including transport.
And what does the Chief of Mission do 100 days before the Olympic Games?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I am making a common agenda in terms of communication with the organizing committee in Sochi.
Putin Promises Ecological Olympics, Plans to Shut Down Giant Secret Landfills
Fans of winter sports are already cutting a meter until the start of the Olympic Games in Sochi, while others are increasingly concerned about their preparation.
The Russian Olympic Games, which will not start until February, are facing another scandal.
It seems that the Russians are not able to fulfill their promise that the preparation and holding of the games will not disturb the nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will go in four months.
After the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had a very high bar, and the Canadian Games were the most environmentally friendly in the history of the Olympics.
However, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s commitment to organizing “zero waste” games seems to have been long overdue.
AP reporters last week discovered a huge dump of construction material in the village of Akhshtyr near Sochi.
So, a landfill full of building materials, tires, canisters and insulation foams was found in August by environmentalists, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities were fermenting and the landfill disappeared.
But only for a moment.
Last week, reporters had a look at a landfill the size of three football fields.
It is not the only one, several have been created in the area of such places, described the British newspaper The Times.
The Russian Railways, a state monopoly, is building a 60-kilometer road between Sochi airport and the sports resort.
The enterprise, which has already swallowed 280 billion rubles, was led by one of Putin’s close associates, Vladimir Yakunin.
In August, the railways prevented the landfill from being set up by one of the subcontractors.
The locals are desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Achshtyr, trucks full of waste material have been driving around the village for three months, day and night.
According to experts, the waste threatens to contaminate the local Mzymtu river, other streams and, ultimately, the Black Sea.
“The water from here is contaminating the Sochi water springs for the next 10 to 15 years,” Vladimir Kimayev of the environmental non-profit organization EWNC told the British newspaper.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem of the Russian organizing committee and the government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
For comparison, the Sochi Games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing cost $43 billion.
Last year’s London Games cost just $19 billion and Vancouver’s $9 billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and concerns about whether there will be enough snow in the end, there have also been reports that human rights are not being respected when working on an exhibition of sports facilities and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers sewed his mouth shut to protest that he had not been paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organisers are grappling with a new law banning the promotion of homosexuality during the Games.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
Young couple matured to live with parents, new house offers privacy to both generations
Japanese studio Tai and Associates was given the task of designing a house on a plot that lies on the corner of two streets, with the plot itself somewhat sloping.
The requirement further stated that there would be two generations living in the house who would like to live together, but each should have its own clearly separated space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly sloping plot.
Therefore, the architects decided to place each household in one of the floors of the house.
"When designing the design, we respected the family ties, history and memories associated with the place."
"The three different functions of the house are connected through the exterior of the building in several ways, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but at the same time they have their own privacy," the designers explain.
The household of the parents is at the level of a garden with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories are attached.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, because they differ in the final finish of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which was formed by panels of planks, the part where the office is plastered white, and the remaining elements remained in a clean concrete design without further modifications.
Many of the walls of the house are completely glazed, thanks to which the interior of the house is very interconnected with the exterior.
The household of the parents, more precisely the kitchen, dining room and living room, is surrounded by a small garden with a tree, which is of great importance for the family.
The connection of the interior with the exterior is emphasized by the side wall, which begins in the garden and continues until the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
A young couple enters the house through the main entrance to the hall and from there climbs the stairs to their premises.
It is the stairs that are the main dominant of the interior of the house.
Their design allows a lot of natural light to cascade through them.
This is what the architects tried to distinguish the house from others and imprint something unique on it.
The household of a young couple is described as one open space with a kitchen area, dining room and living room together.
It is separated from the terrace only by a glass wall with sliding doors.
Living area with dining and kitchen area in the home of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space, which freely passes to the terrace, from where there is a nice view of Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the top floor is conceived in a pure combination of white and black.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
A young couple enters the house through the main entrance, finds themselves in the entrance hall and from there climbs the stairs upwards.
Defend academic freedom, this applies to Zeman and ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called on students, teachers and management of secondary and higher schools in several regions to defend academic freedom before the election campaign conducted by President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman at schools.
I have met with more or less success.
The rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused a lecture by the honorary chairman of the SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, even received reprisals in the form of a non-invitation to the celebration of the national holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of representatives of schools who were no longer so brave and enabled the visit of Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman: Brno University of Technology, Hladnov Grammar School in Ostrava, University of Business in Ostrava, Business Academy in Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n, J.E. Purkyn<0xC4><0x9B> University in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem.
Now in Pardubice, we are faced with the continuation of policy enforcement at universities.
The newly elected ODS MP, Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic post and, moreover, it seems normal to him.
Professor, it's not really the same thing as staying in the mayor's office of a smaller town, for example.
Do you want to join the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD governors, who are simultaneously serving as deputies and governors and, like them, degrade both professions?
By doing this, you are telling people that you can handle both of these challenging functions with your left back.
I know, we have the example of Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek, who even manages several dozen functions at once.
This is not an example of someone you should follow.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánka Fra<0xC5><0x88>ková, who preferred to leave the parliamentary post in order to be able to fully devote herself to the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the post of dean is that you will violate the apolitical nature of the academic soil of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the Pardubice ODS sees your current work at both positions as an advantage for the University.
However, you will be able to help your "school" without being a dean.
I think that your students will have a similar opinion as I and rector Miroslav Ludwig.
So consider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, it may happen to you that the voters will count it in the next election.
And that doesn't have to be long.
In Kunovice, cabbage bubbles do not add chemistry to it
More than a thousand tons of sauerkraut will be produced in the coming months in Slovácká Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the Hamé food group.
The season started in October and will last about six months.
Healthy delicacy has been produced here since 1925 in a traditional way, i.e. by pedaling directly in large tanks.
In modern industrial times, it is a rarity.
Our employees will find a ten-kilometer route in exchange.
Each of the ten tanks will fit fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage, filling one takes three shifts," said the director of the Slovácká Fruta plant, David Kladroba.
Cabbage heads are transported to the premises of the company directly from their fields by farmers mainly from Ostro<0xC5><0xBE>sk and B<0xC5><0x99>eclavsk.
Fruta employees then clean the vegetables, remove the chestnuts and throw them into the crotch.
From there, the already cut cabbage falls into pools six meters deep, in which tramps dressed in white clothes and boots work tirelessly.
This eliminates the unwanted air.
The last trampled layer of cabbage is covered with tarpaulin and loaded with water.
"The green breadcrumb then matures for six to eight weeks under spontaneous milk fermentation without any addition of fermentation-promoting substances," the director of Kladroba stressed.
The natural process corresponds to the production at home, individual layers of workers are sprinkled with salt and cumin.
Cabbage after fermenting goes to the filling line.
It is packaged in a sweet-sour infusion into bags or glasses and undergoes sterilization.
Hamé supplies sauerkraut mainly to the domestic and Slovak market.
It is also registered in some other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden 'willing to cooperate' with Germany over U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, a snitch from the US intelligence services, announced that he is willing to go to Berlin to hand over evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander are not able to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German MEP Hans-Christian Str<0xC3><0xA4>bele met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and discussed with him the possibility of testifying in Germany.
The letter from Mr Snowden, which the MEP handed over to the media in Berlin on Friday, states: “Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat the opposition as fugitives and tries to criminalize political speeches with heavy lawsuits that do not give room for defense.”
Telling the truth is not a crime.
In that letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States government to drop the criminal charges brought against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany’s interior minister, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make that possible.”
Tensions between the U.S. and Germany began to mount when allegations surfaced that the NSA was tapping Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees the news, said that if there was any opportunity to question Mr Snowden as a witness “without exposing himself to danger and completely destroying relations with the US,” it should be done.
Mr Str<0xC3><0xA4>bele, a member of parliament for the German Green Party, tweeted a photo of himself with Mr Snowden.
On his way to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Str<0xC3><0xA4>bele said that according to a former NSA contractor lawyer, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left once.
If Mr. Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be “safe” there, a member of parliament said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he faced a harsh and persistent campaign of persecution that forced him to leave home.
But he said the world’s response to his “act of political expression” had given him courage.
Citizens everywhere and high-ranking officials – including those in the United States – have evaluated the revelation of an unwarranted system of omnipresent surveillance for public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities “until the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved.”
Killing us sorry, but we are innocent, defends Khmer Rouge leaders
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Rouge hierarchy and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
Under the Khmer Rouge regime, which relied on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism from 1975 to 1979, more than three million Cambodians, at least a quarter of the population, were killed as a result of exhaustion, starvation, disease, torture and execution.
The commander of the notorious S-21 prison was sentenced to life in prison by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing that they were acting in the best interests of the nation and not knowing the true extent of the killing.
"It's easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything and therefore intervened and corrected the situation," Samphan said in court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I had no authority,” he added.
Nuon Chea said he never ordered Khmer Rouge cadres “to mistreat or kill people, to withhold food or commit genocide.”
But he acknowledged "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all the Cambodian people," he said.
Bin Sivla, 55, who lost 11 relatives under the Khmer Rouge regime, told AFP she could not accept an apology from Nuon Chea.
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be exonerated."
"He doesn't care about others," she said.
"If he didn't give the orders, his subordinates wouldn't be killed," she added, adding that the Khmer Rouge leaders were "worse than monsters."
The “foreign minister” of the Khmer Rouge regime, Ieng Sary, was also due to stand trial, but died in March this year.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, was found unable to stand trial for dementia in September 2012.
Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is going to charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for hand luggage on board during its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a charge of up to $100 for carry-on luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although it said in its announcement Wednesday that passengers will be able to keep the entire can.
The new hand luggage fee applies to luggage in the upper storage compartment, so small luggage under the seat will remain free of charge.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if passengers wait to pay until they arrive at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O’Malley said the $100 fee was meant to encourage passengers to make the payment in advance.
"We don't want to charge that fee," she said.
Airlines began charging for the first and second bags in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these charges and crammed into hand luggage hidden in the storage space as much as they could, so there was often no space in that space.
Fees are one way to teach passengers to take fewer things on board.
O'Malley said that the purpose of this new fee is not really to get more money.
The point is that Frontier’s most loyal customers have made it quite clear that finding a place in the upper storage space is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company’s website will not be charged.
This means that one passenger in the queue at the Frontier gate can bring luggage for which they will not pay anything, while the other passenger in the queue will pay $100 for the same luggage.
O'Malley said the website and check-in procedures would be adjusted to ensure passengers were aware of the charge before arriving at the gate.
The new Frontier hand luggage fee will not be in effect until summer, but the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They argue that handling luggage costs money, and passengers who request this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the additional baggage charge as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most, however, did not touch the fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge for hand luggage three years ago, and another low-cost airline, Allegiant Air, followed suit.
The only company that also has such fees is Hungary’s Wizz Air, says aviation consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit’s hand luggage fee would bring in $50 million annually.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew with Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when passengers encountered Spirit’s unusual hand luggage fee.
"Getting on the plane was the smoothest I've ever seen in my aviation career," he said.
I expected to see a gnashing of teeth and an argument at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, “and the boarding took place in an instant.”
Frontier will also apply fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice, modeled after Spirit.
Frontier said passengers who get a lemonade or juice can keep the whole can and the coffee will be refilled free of charge.
Water will continue to be provided free of charge.
US Airways briefly tried to introduce beverage charges in 2008, but after complaints from passengers, it backed down seven months later and was not imitated by any other major airline.
Frontier’s latest move to charge for hand luggage, if a passenger does not purchase a flight directly from the airline, is its latest effort to direct customers directly to its website.
Airlines pay online travel retailers, such as Orbitz, $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has given all airlines the incentive to lead passengers to purchase directly from them instead of doing so through online travel agencies.
However, Frontier has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, it began giving customers who bought through an online travel agency only half the miles as part of a loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the reward for miles flown to 25 percent of the distance.
So a 1,000-mile journey with Frontier purchased through an online travel agency means a reward of 250 miles.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make a purchase directly through the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home city of Denver, but its business is starting to shrink and lose money.
According to the financial results reported on Wednesday by the company's partner Republic Airways Holdings, sales fell by 9 percent and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter.
With the sale of this airline, Republic is trying to solve Frontier’s financial problems.
NSA doesn’t blame hackers for website crash, but ‘internal error’
The secretive National Security Agency said last Friday that its website fell for several hours last week due to an internal error, not a hacker attack, as some claimed on the internet.
"The NSA.gov site was not accessible for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a regular update," the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The claim that the outage was caused by a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server sensors noted that the NSA website had been down for at least six hours and the site was no longer available to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s internal sensitive networks were not “at all” threatened.
The spokesman said no classified information was at risk.
At least one group of hacker activists on the Internet claimed to be responsible for disabling NSA sites through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until the servers are overloaded and the page crashes.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA super-secret agency, once nicknamed No Agency Like It, has become the focus of public attention in recent months after a string of revelations of foreign and domestic surveillance programs, and has come under intense criticism for the product of the NSA’s theft of classified files from the agency and their disclosure by a disenchanted former employee, Edward.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has fueled earlier speculation that today’s accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Bombardier’s profit fell as a result of falling supplies and orders
Canadian aircraft and train maker Bombardier reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, driven by fewer orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not release any flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor did it offer up-to-date information on whether the aircraft would follow an ambitious plan to begin commercial operations from next September.
After the initial test flight about a month and a half ago, the aircraft flew only three times, raising the question of whether the test phase is progressing well.
The results did not meet estimates, and shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange fell by 8 percent.
State-owned bank analyst Cameron Doerksen on Thursday downgraded the rating from “higher yield” to “sector performance” with the expectation that the stock market will experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
“While smaller deliveries of aircraft were mostly expected, the profit margin in the transport sector has disappointed us significantly,” Doerksen said in a report to clients.
As the trial program continues, we believe Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of this program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries will break into the lower market area, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was revealed in March, and after several months of delay, the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of binding orders for CSeries aircraft reaches a modest 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flight in order to be able to verify the company’s claims regarding the low consumption and cost savings of this transport aircraft.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, CEO of Bombardier, expected Bombardier to reach 300 binding orders when the first aircraft was put into commercial service.
Executives also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was proceeding as planned.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane's shutdown.
Every manufacturer plans it differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on the updates and we did that.
This will be the case throughout the flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft is scheduled to take off in the coming weeks and the others shortly thereafter.
Analysts are sceptical that the first customer could start operating the CSeries 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier says it has evaluated its plan to put the aircraft into service and will provide updated information in the coming months.
“This slow pace of flight testing – although consistent with Bombardier’s internal plan – is likely to reinforce our view that commissioning will be pushed back to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
From $172 million, or 9 cents per share, in the previous year, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, in the third quarter ending September 30.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Turnover marginally declined from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to Thomson Reuters’ IBES system, analysts expected a return of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it delivered only 45 aircraft in the quarter, compared with 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Unfulfilled orders in the aviation division amounted to 32.9 billion as of September 30, which does not change as of December 31.
“The results in aviation were in line with our outlook, but the low order intake and overall market condition have disappointed us,” Beaudoin said.
Revenue in the aviation industry fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train maker, said revenue in the division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled transport orders amounted to 32.6 billion as of September 30, which is marginal growth compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
Leaders said new outlooks would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier, which also announced the arrival of Google CFO Patrick Pichette, fell 8.5 percent to $4.83 during trading on Thursday afternoon.
Embraer SA, Brazil’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest competitor, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
A cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned a mobster about a police investigation is in jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, was to pass information to the king of the underworld, Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer feared that his drug addiction would come to light.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top defense attorney who briefed a drug mobster on a major police investigation because he feared his drug addiction would come to light has been sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was to give sensitive information to Neil Scarbrough, the head of the underworld, about an investigation into his drug-smuggling activities, after he became suspected of using cocaine.
The lawyer, nicknamed “Bash” (the party) and hailed by criminals as the best lawyer, was arrested at his home in 2011 after police surveillance of Scarborough, whom he had represented in previous drug-related proceedings.
The officers saw Sarborough, 32, leaving three bags of cocaine at a lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, who had just been out to dinner with his colleagues from the Law Society.
Based on tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation revealed that Ditta was a regular user of Class A drugs.
During an eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he tried to obtain information about the arrest of two men in favor of Scarborough and his companion.
All four suspects were being monitored at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire areas.
After police seized <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine along with <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during a series of raids, another 32 people were jailed along with them.
Ditta, 42, was passing on information to criminals for fear of coming to terms with his cocaine addiction.
Today, Ditta, who works for Blackburn-based law firm Forbes Solicitors, experienced a shameful moment before the Liverpool Crown Court when he was found guilty of obstructing justice in two cases after a three-week trial.
During an earlier hearing, he confessed to possession of cocaine.
The lawyer’s fall came after a police investigation into Scarborough revealed that he had been in regular telephone contact with Dita in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house, and saw him place 60 percent pure drugs under the lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Scarborough and Ditta, who was having dinner at Blackburn Rovers Football Stadium in Ewood Park, were in a regular phone conversation.
The lawyer returned home to find the drugs, and there were nine interviews between the two men.
The court heard that there were traces of Class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards, and that Ditta was a “regular user” of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, saying he spoke to the suspected dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation fell within "confidential communication".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to take out several credit cards, but they were all detained and hair samples were taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he said that he operated the office both at his home address and at the workplace, and that clients visited him at home for work matters.
However, the court heard that after the key arrests, he contacted major players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, to tell them what the detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “Who else is more aware of not breaking the law than a criminal attorney.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a solicitor and of coming into too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we are talking about here is not just about a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his interviews were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the normal lawyer-client relationship.
The police investigation was thwarted as much as possible to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not give his profession a good reputation, on the contrary, he dishonored it.
He got too close to some of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be undermined.
Ditta denied the wrongdoing, saying, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to give Mr. Scarborough information, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately."
However, after the hearing, police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: “Mr. Ditta became a criminal himself when he started getting drugs from organized criminals.”
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of leading organized crime groups tasked with gathering valuable information about the police investigation.
Legal representatives must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and should inspire confidence in the public and the feeling that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit in Lancashire has been conducting an investigation against Mr Ditt, on the basis of which he has also been convicted of three cases of cocaine possession and now of obstruction of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bring the criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
A further 35 people involved in trafficking were jailed for a total of 153 years for drug offenses.
On his website, Ditta arranged an online interview in which he said that his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the death row in America, he would like Mohammed Ali as a guest for dinner, and he cited inequality as a motivation for the work.
He negotiated a government with Klaus and <0xC5><0xA0>pidla.
Now the people's leaders have sent Jan Kasal against Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
The People's Party won 14 seats in the elections, only a third of the number of Social Democrats or representatives of the ANO.
However, they enter into negotiations on the government with at least one advantage.
In the team, which has already begun to argue the outlines of a possible coalition, they have Jan Kasal - a man who during the People's Party adjusted the conditions of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Neither the Social Democrats nor Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> have such a matador on their side.
Perhaps this time it will be reminiscent of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"The experience was minimal at the time," Kasal estimates, as this year's talks will develop.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
"This is a terrible news and it is appropriate to ask what will prevent parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," the paper said, calling the bill unconstitutional.
“This law is strict and very repressive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of the world’s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is an extended arm of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope that the president will listen to us and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs," he said.
According to the Star newspaper, the bill effectively gives the government “full control of the media” and the Standard newspaper states that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya have “taken a hard blow” and criticizes the bill as “strict”.
The bill comes amid a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the immediate aftermath of the September attack by an Islamic gunman at the Westgate shopping center.
The anger of the authorities was turned on itself by the Kenyan media when they broadcast a security camera recording of soldiers sent to the scene of the attack allegedly looting a luxury goods store.
The police director responded by summoning two journalists and a senior media officer for questioning, but the summons was later withdrawn after pressure from the media.
Under the new bill, media companies can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million, along with the risk of being “excluded from the list” or denied official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to seize the offender’s property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “a single fine is enough to wipe out most radio stations.”
It is also stated that these measures can have a liquidating impact on what is called Kenya’s “living blogosphere”.
Politicians know that if they silence the media, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
"You never know what might happen," Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist for the Nation newspaper, wrote, describing Kenyan media as a key source of a system of mutual control and balance in public life.
“If we leave it to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and throw us back to hunting and collecting,” he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have been the target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted to abolish the cuts ordered by the National Wage Agency and to restore their fat salaries to around 532,000 tax-free shillings a month, making them among the highest in the world.
They have to be saved, the young Czechs know.
Most people don’t even know what interest rates are.
More and more Czechs are putting their money aside.
However, they do not reach the champions in saving in the region.
Most of the money is saved by Austrians, who save an average of 181 euros per month.
People in Slovakia save a little more than Czechs.
This is according to a survey by the Erste Savings Barometer group in Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of savers is improving, and two-thirds of respondents plan to put more money aside.
While the Czechs are roughly in the middle of the saver rankings, in Romania and Serbia, people who save products still use very little.
For example, almost every second Serb saves at home "under the pillow", according to the survey.
In the Czech Republic this year, the number of those who save higher amounts per month has increased.
Last year, between CZK 1,000 and CZK 2,500 were deposited every month by 26 percent of respondents, this year it is five percent more.
However, the average monthly deposit in the year-on-year comparison decreased slightly to CZK 2078.
The biggest hit among savings products is supplementary pension insurance.
This is preferred by 54% of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to value savings for only 36% of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of building savings is decreasing, compared to last year, the interest in investment funds has also significantly decreased.
Only 16 percent of respondents are already using them, compared to almost a quarter of people last year.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to save, most of them do not know what returns on individual products they achieve.
Especially young people under 30 do not know how their money is interest-bearing.
On the contrary, the oldest group of respondents has the best awareness of the profitability of their deposited money, 73 percent of people over 50 know it.
In an international comparison, Erste Group Czechs lead in the use of online banking, which is regularly used by 44 percent of people.
They are followed by Slovaks and Austrians with a 12 percent gap.
UN Celebrates New Goals to Combat Poverty
The United Nations is starting to work urgently on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were introduced 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
Ahead of the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing through the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015.
They were included in the final concept document to be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit that now was the time to “rise above national interests.”
“I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and take over a process to implement the SDGs,” he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress made under the MDGs and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development agenda.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to realise our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which builds on the success of the MDGs.
Concerns over the security of Mozambique are growing due to the conflict of strong personalities
Under the statue of Samora Machela, Mozambican president of the founder, thousands gathered in the center of Maputo to chant peaceful slogans at a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of the investment firm.
Fearing for her country’s future, she traded in corporate clothing for a T-shirt emblazoned with “we demand safety” in Portuguese and joined the crowd at Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, there were almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo party, some of the worst skirmishes since the peace deal more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once an infamous insurgent movement, initially supported by the white government in Rhodesia and then by the apartheid government in South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country’s independent government.
After the peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe an open conflict is unlikely to re-emerge in the country, but recent events have spooked foreign and local investors.
A fast-growing economy is at stake, as discoveries of vast coastal oil reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Brazil’s Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy’s Eni and the U.S.’s Anadarko.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
The Renamo party claims that the government sparked the latest conflicts by launching an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional stronghold of the Renamo Party, on September 17.
The violent assault by the former rebels subsequently culminated when government forces attacked the Renamo party base and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, party spokesman Renamo Fernando Mazanga told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for starting the conflicts because it allegedly attacked the soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to allay fears of instability.
Mr. Guebuza told AFP news agency on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama saw himself as a “loser” who wanted to use “whatever is left of his powers to try to prove he can order the government to make his own decisions.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo say they want to avoid war.
Concerns grew, however, when Mazanga was quoted as saying that the Renamo party was withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the Frelimo party no longer respects the agreement.
"Our aim is to return to negotiations, but with seriousness," Mr Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the two sides have done little to ease tensions between the two sides, fanned by a series of skirmishes this year.
It’s a skirmish between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said Open University lecturer and Mozambique expert Joseph Hanlon.
Neither of them is a good negotiator and neither of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which has campaigned for electoral change, has already said it would boycott municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an effort by the dying movement to gain benefits and financial gain from the government.
The electoral share of the Renamo party has been declining since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by a former member of the Renamo party, is expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr Mazanga says Mr Guebuza – whose second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country’s democracy.
“It doesn’t want a democratic system of multiple parties, it doesn’t want transparent elections, it doesn’t want peace because it doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options the Renamo party has, but it has carried out devastating terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key road between north and south.
Most of the skirmishes took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers from the capital Maputo, but where the city of Beira, a port on which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely, in their coal exports.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railway for about a week, when the Renamo party threatened to attack the line.
Mr. Mazanga did not want to comment on the question of whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good,” Mazanga said.
Instability has increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent flood of kidnappings.
“People think that the responsibility for the country’s future lies solely with the government and the president, and that he should be the one to find solutions to the problems,” she says.
Demonstrator Omar Sultane says people just want stability.
“Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace, they want free access to the roads,” he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for a way of life,” says the author.
The stories of Thor may show that “gross force cannot equal clever cunning,” while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Much of the myth would “be too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene for school instruction,” said Crossley-Holland, who advocates careful selection of age-appropriate works.
“I think it’s great that myths and folk art are already part of education,” he said.
I've been defending this plan for 20 years.
He added that “openly instructive” authors and teachers are at the heart of an engaging story with a “subliminal” message for children as a “switch”.
Crossley-Holland, who translated the epic Beowulf from English and who also writes the Norse Myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Tales, says, “You can have good intentions, but you’ll do better if you keep them to yourself.”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need for some sense of hope.
It is not that everything must be simplified or end in a happy ending, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And it must be subconscious; revealed through a story, not openly stated.
The old truth is that it is better to show than to describe.
The Brno Observatory will take visitors to space in a new digital
At first glance, it is clear that the hall of the large planetarium has changed over the past six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can immerse themselves in new comfortable seats and above their heads a projection area of 17 meters in diameter in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To make the picture perfect, other smaller projectors are scattered around the room.
Another important part of the whole device is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"These are twenty-one computers that generate an image," said Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek, director of the Brno Observatory.
Computers ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a holistic impression.
"Computer performance is thirty to forty times higher than that of conventional personal computers," said Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Hlad<0xC3><0xAD>k, a technician at the observatory.
Digitarium can conjure up an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, the human body or the bottom of the ocean.
Viewers find themselves right in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
Another similar facility is closest to Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the observatory plans to project the purchased programs and their own creations in the hall.
There are two shows scheduled for Saturday.
The first one is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
In it, people learn about the training of astronauts, fly into space, turn on the centrifuge, and then see on illustrative examples how difficult conditions astronauts face in space.
The second program is for children and has the name Magic Cliff - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a cliff whose colorful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until the moment when a nearby volcano exploded.
The entire digitarium cost about fifty million crowns, which was paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the observatory also contributed smaller amounts from their budget.
The projection area cost ten million crowns, the projector twelve million.
"The rest was swallowed up by audio-visual technology and computers," Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek explained.
The installation of the digitarium followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the observatory passed through two years ago.
According to the director Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek, 25 to 30 thousand visitors could come by the end of the year.
We have studied 11 THOUSAND INSERATES!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis captured more than 11,000 job postings, of which 4,300 were published in the daily press and 6,800 ads (62 percent) on the Internet.
The Internet has become the most important medium for publishing job offers.
Back in 2005, when the survey was first conducted, its share was 26 percent.
In the last two surveys (2007, 2010) it has stabilised at around 60 percent.
According to the analysis, the advertising of job opportunities largely reflects the current situation on the labor market.
An example is a simple comparison of the number of published ads in a period of economic prosperity and in a time of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, almost 25,900 advertisements were published in the same reference period, compared with less than half in 2012.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is focused on a narrower, especially more qualified group of professions.
On the other hand, the offer of jobs in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including those of workers, said the author of the analysis Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na <0xC5><0xA0>t'astnová.
The level of representation of selected professional groups is different in both media.
On the Internet, advertisements seeking managers and executives, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts took the leading places.
The position of programmers or small business leaders was only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, large representation belongs mainly to service and workers' professions.
Of course, education is one of the most frequently cited requirements that employers express through advertising.
Other areas studied included knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the requirement for knowledge of a foreign language was stated in three percent of advertisements, on the Internet in 37 percent.
In only 2% of the ads, employers required active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims of 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 percent of advertisements (11 percent in the daily press, 57 percent on the Internet).
Practice in the field was required in 54% of advertisements.
The requirements for practice are generally associated with qualified professions.
These are mainly production managers and other managers.
In the case of workers’ professions, they are mainly mechanics and repairers or producers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical devices, added the author of the study, Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Tillner.
Employers also indicate in the middle of their advertisements the requirements for the characteristics and skills of potential candidates.
As the most frequently required skills, communication skills have long appeared in the first place in advertising.
In addition, employers demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, independence, responsibility, organizational skills and reliability.
Ben Greenman: The 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival
It could be argued that the city of New York is the birthplace of solo comedy in America: almost a century ago, the variety artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chairman of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes to the assembled people using the method of conversation.
Faye’s innovation has spread over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival, founded and directed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolinas Solo Comedy Institution, is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year – along with more than sixty performances in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these titles have appeared in the Carolinas and have become so successful that they are too big to be played at the club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year’s event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as “Stand Up for Heroes,” an annual musical comedy benefit performance at Madison Square Garden featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cos, among others.
As the festival expanded, so did the world of comedy.
Several of the comedians attending this year’s festival came from non-traditional channels, such as shows at smaller radio or television companies such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has stepped out with his sitcom (the hilariously spicy "League" on a fantasy-football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a member of both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, but is best known for her fast-paced series of videos, Marcel the shell with shoes on.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognizable voices (surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the gritty, racially-focused W. Kamau Bell), are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest draws of the festival will be the interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting takes place at Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedic DNA of Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that while he was here, he sometimes walked down the aisle between two buildings and said to himself, “Man, if I lose all my money, maybe I’ll live here.”
The price of oil fell further to $ 96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about high inventories were offset by a report that showed a strengthening of China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector.
The U.S. crude oil index for December deliveries during the late morning fell in European e-commerce on the New York Stock Exchange by 14 cents to $ 96.24 per barrel.
On Thursday, the decline was 39 cents, and for the month of October, it fell by 5.8 percent.
In the past few weeks, oil prices have been high.
The Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. stockpiles had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the past week.
In five weeks, inventories increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports on Chinese production spurred more demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth, which rose to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after two weak decades.
Brent crude, an indicator for international oil also used by U.S. refiners, fell 26 cents on the London International Trade Exchange to $108.58 a barrel.
Well, no, Mr. Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians not to do this.
It is necessary to exert such pressure that Martin Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is deprived of all political functions and leaves the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture that is already so elusive.
Martin Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is protected by the promise he made, but everyone and the politician in particular must be aware of the consequences of the promise and very consider what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that a politician has (Mr. Babi<0xC5><0xA1> also has the material one, but the question is whether he is a politician).
A better program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
He does not apologize in politics, he resigns in politics.
Mr. Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements make me say so, if you haven't lied - here you see how difficult it is to lie), you will leave politics alone, as a man.
People will then accept your apology as an expression of a man who has made a mistake and is responsible for it.
Otherwise, you will be perceived as a spineless weakling whose words and actions cannot be trusted.
You either want to be a proud person, albeit a flawed person, or a life-long scythe.
It may seem unfair to you that I only speak to you, but you are the leader and they are just the wrong sheep.
And you're a leader, and you've always wanted to be.
I understand you're trying to bend your ears for a moment, regroup your strength, sit out the embarrassment, and then attack again, but that's how guerrillas or bad guys behave.
You are, I repeat, in your own eyes the leader, the alpha male, so behave.
Take responsibility and get out of politics.
The court blocked the regulation on the procedure for stopping and searching people by the police department in New York
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a court order demanding changes to the stop-and-search program at the New York City police department and recalled the judge from the case.
A second U.S. federal appeals court said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision would be delayed until after the city's appeal decision.
In August, a judge ruled that the city had violated the Constitution by carrying out its program of stopping and interrogating people.
The city challenged its conclusions and its correctional regulations, including the decision to assign supervision that would help the police department change its procedures and its training program associated with them.
On Tuesday, the appeals court heard arguments for the requested postponement.
The appeals court said the judge must be dismissed from the case because she had come into conflict with the rules of conduct for judges, by not acting as a judge under the requirement to avoid appearances of bias, in part because of a series of interviews with the media and a public statement in which she openly responded to criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unfairly targeting blacks and Hispanics as part of their stop-and-search program.
It established independent oversight to oversee major changes, including reform of procedures, training and supervision, and ordered the launch of a pilot programme to test body-worn cameras in some of the areas where people are most often stopped.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the method of keeping the names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after a police search.
The oral grounds for the appeal of the city are scheduled for sometime after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching people have been criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
In some form, people have been stopped and searched for about a decade, but searches under the direction of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg have dramatically increased to a record 684,330 in 2011, most of them blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men, all of them minorities, wrote a lawsuit that became a class action case.
Proponents of the NYPD’s stop-and-search program argue that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force, and may affect how other police departments use these practices.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morale, but not criminality, and that it will waste money, but will not solve the broader problem of pressure on the police force after its numbers have dropped by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not end the practice of stopping and searching people, which is constitutional, but reformed the way the NYPD had established searches.
One-fifth of shopping centres face low traffic
This is according to real estate advisory firms Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
In Bohnice opens to the public Shopping Centre Krakow, will be the 19th shopping center in Prague.
There are now a total of 90 large shopping centres in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfactory performance affects about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centers.
The main problems are an inadequately large center in relation to the location and bad layouts, i.e. too many floors or complicated and confusing layout of passages, or dead places of centers," Michal Soták from Cushman & Wakefield said.
Also, according to Jones Lang LaSalle’s head of retail real estate, Sylvie Samadi, about a fifth of shopping malls are struggling with low traffic.
The main reasons include poor transport accessibility, low income category of local residents or oversaturation of the market in a given place.
Some projects opened almost fully occupied, but their results were mainly initially unsatisfactory.
Nowadays, customers are somewhat conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.
The new shopping malls must do more to lure their customers to new brands in the market, entertainment, services and marketing events,” Samadi added.
According to Soták, the occupancy of shopping centers is generally stable, even in some centers it is increasing, because the landlords were willing to reduce the rent and rent some units in the crisis.
"However, it is true that some projects have recently opened that are not fully occupied and the average occupancy is thus reduced (for example, Breda & Weinstein in Opava, <0xC5><0xA0>antovka in Olomouc), " added Soták.
Shopping malls opened in the past two years have been very slow to market, according to Sylvie Samadi.
There is a market for new projects.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see a space for the construction of a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convinience centres', focused on shopping and daily needs services for the population living in the immediate vicinity," Samadi said.
Also, according to Soták, there is a place on the domestic market for other shopping centers.
Both for small 'service' centres and for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or extensions in regional cities.
"Cities like Kladno, <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, Brno or Pilsen have room for further growth," Soták added.
In Prague, he sees a space for a shopping center on V<0xC3><0xAD>t<0xC4><0x9B>zné nám<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD>, and according to him, they have a clear potential street Na P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>kop<0xC4><0x9B> and Wenceslas Square.
"The expansion of retail parks is intensively developing, which allow retailers to cover and expand to increasingly smaller cities at favorable rental and operating costs, there is also space in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centers, or their reconstruction, such as the reconstruction of Prior department stores, which benefit from a good location," Dita DZ added to Kubánková's company.
In the Czech Republic, there are currently 90 modern shopping centers with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross leasable area.
A quarter of all these shopping centres are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, according to Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to values from the UK and France, the Czech Republic lags behind by about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson hacked his phone to check his tip
Former News of the World (NotW) editor Andy Coulson allegedly used methods of “telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” to confirm a fraudulent tip about a love affair that was supposed to involve then-Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Attorney General Andrew Edis told the Old Bailey court that the News of the World caught false reports in May 2005 that Clarke had been seen with his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and penetrate her privacy, but the court heard that Coulson had also called her and left her voicemails.
“The attorney general suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a man standing outside hoping to catch people out, but a man who likes to tell people stories to see what they say,” Mr. Edis said.
He said the NotW newspaper used three ways to explore stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Apparently he knows about the other, surveillance, he must know about her.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hack?
He says no, we say, "But of course he knows."
Rumors of a love affair involving Clarke were first picked up by NotW's reporting department when a source who was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby was told, "You're just wasting your time, she's with Charles."
A recording of voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcair's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on the private investigator’s computer where Ms. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as “Projects.”
While Mrs. Pawlby was under investigation, her grandparents received anonymous phone calls asking for information about Pawlby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief rapporteur Neville Thurlbeck and former rapporteur James Weatherup oversaw Ms Pawlby's tracking.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail in which he told her, "I've got a story we're about to publish tomorrow that I'd love to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Edis says Coulson’s involvement in the story followed the same model as that of other prominent figures, including former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
In court on Thursday, it was reported that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett over a love affair with a married woman, while he himself was seeing co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied collusion with others for the purpose of hacking into phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted to hacking the phone.
NSA revelations increase social paranoia of state surveillance
One peaceful day in late August, a German police helicopter buzzed over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the direction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, the mission’s purpose was to take photographs of the roof of the U.S. advance patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hoped to identify the presence of eavesdropping antennas, a move that triggered an exchange of views between the US and German foreign ministers in Berlin.
James Clapper, the US director of national intelligence, again insisted in September that the US was not using its foreign intelligence capabilities “to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of US companies and thus strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, who became an informant, began to reveal his valuable collection of secret surveillance by the United States, European governments and leading businessmen no longer know whether to trust the director’s words.
After reports that the U.S. National Security Agency was spying on a Brazilian oil company and gaining access to data held by U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, widespread paranoia about state surveillance has reached new proportions.
The latest drop came with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone may have been tapped for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be a target, then the leading entrepreneurs are certainly a potential target.
Snowden has made clear the intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” said Oliver Gr<0xC3><0xBC>n, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey released in July by EY advisory service, German companies are convinced that when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, the US now poses as great a risk as China.
So far, however, there is no evidence in all of the documentation disclosed by Mr. Snowden that the United States was passing on trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities, and said it should try to limit its dependence on the US:
Business leaders are sceptical about this.
The German parliament is saying that we should make a German Google.
All I can do is close my eyes and slowly open them again...
That’s not the way to go, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, they should not have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
The scale and technical sophistication of U.S. spy agencies uncovered by Snowden is still shocking to some companies who thought China was the biggest threat from surveillance.
A major shift is taking place in cloud computing, where European officials have become increasingly aware that data stored in the U.S. falls under U.S. jurisdiction and is therefore potentially countervailable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of non-U.S. members canceled plans to use a U.S.-based cloud provider after the revelation of the U.S. Prism data mining program.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP’s CEOs, says: “We have a new question for customers that wasn’t here a year ago – where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will physically stay in this jurisdiction?”
Many German high-ranking officials argue that the latest reports are just confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and that this data must be protected at all costs.
That economic espionage is being carried out is not a surprise.
It's always happened.
“This has been an important topic for many years, and it has not changed significantly during the current discussion,” said Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we are spying on them because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders generally do not want to boast about the countermeasures they have taken to avoid giving the attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that it is at least unreasonable to take a free USB drive to the trade fair or leave an unprotected laptop in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi’s board of directors, says it has been common practice for many years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting to prevent them from being used as listening devices.
Germany’s BfV office is advising executives to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones abroad because of the risk that smartphones could be embezzled.
Prepaid mobile phones will then be thrown away.
However, there is a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are the leading representatives of the global market in their specific areas.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorised access,” the BfV warned in its report.
The U.S. warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
In February, according to the Washington Post, US National Intelligence Estimate documents listed France alongside Russia and Israel as second-line perpetrators of hacking activities for economic reporters, just behind China.
A board member at a German risk-free company concluded that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of France’s domestic intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview this month: “The services know very well that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Parents of Georgia boy who died in freak accident believe he was murdered
The parents of a Georgia minor whose body was found inside a tangled wrestling ghost in his high school gymnasium believe their son was murdered, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Georgia, was found trapped in a spirited stand behind a high school gymnasium on January 11.
The Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the family of the 17-year-old refused.
“They clearly believe that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died as the sheriff had said.
“They believe it goes against logic, against the laws of physics, against common sense,” Crump said.
They believe this is to cover up what really happened in order to protect the person responsible for their son’s death.
"They sent their son to school as usual, and he came back in a body bag," he said.
Attorney General Michael Moore said on Thursday he was leading a routine investigation into Johnson’s death, and noted that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
said Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts wherever they take me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe there is a sufficient basis for a normal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated Johnson had died as a result of “positional asphyxiation.”
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, indicated a different cause of death.
"There are several questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to warrant a criminal investigation or civil rights violation in Johnson’s death, he would ask the FBI and its execution.
The Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office was not immediately available for comment on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to make available all the surveillance footage the investigators had seen.
The teenager’s parents hope the videos will contain a clue to how their son died.
The CDC has issued guidelines for schools on allergies in children.
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help children with food allergies at school.
This is the first set of such guidelines issued by the US government, due to the fact that the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools on how teachers and staff can raise awareness of children’s food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction if one occurs.
It also advises schools to have adrenaline available – most commonly an EpiPen auto-injector – to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State legislatures have recently updated rules that make it easier for schools to store adrenaline.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms appearing in conversations with children who have an allergic reaction.
A child may say, “It’s like someone is stabbing my tongue,” “I feel like I have hair on my tongue,” or “My tongue is itchy.”
Parents of intersex children can choose the “indeterminate sex”
Germany has become the first European nation to recognise a third gender for children born with ambiguous sex characteristics.
Newborn babies will no longer be classified as either male or female.
The new law does not require parents to list any gender for such children, and allows them to list genders on their birth certificates as “indefinite” or “unspecified.”
The aim of the law is to stop pressuring parents to hastily opt for sex-determination surgery on their child, and to combat discrimination against those who are intersex.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said after many years, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I'll remain a piece of bacon made by doctors, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that every year out of 2,000 children, one is born who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall into the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development, covering the term for those who have atypical chromosomes, sex glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Intersex could be Wallis Simpson.
Determining the sex is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when it is impossible to determine the sex, it is better to use the best available information and determine it, instead of waiting and monitoring the psychological and physical development of the child until the operation is performed, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in sex-determination issues, said the new German law “looks like a good thing.”
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but most children are not,” he said.
The sex determination can be done without surgery and then can wait for the identity to develop.
Knowledge of how a child develops sexual identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery as to why some people are gay.
A report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersex people as different from transgender or transgender people because their status is not tied to gender but to their biological makeup, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as either of them.
These traits can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, bust and figure, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and sex organs, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersex and transgender people in the workplace, as well as levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't fit any gender now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to mark male, female or “third gender” in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world’s first recognized “sexless” person in June when she won a court appeal to retain her gender “indefinite” status for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will have a third designation, X, for intersex persons, in addition to M (male) and F (female).
In neighbouring France, the issue of gender is still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from the strongly Catholic country signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school textbooks.
According to the Catholic Online website, “As the world is drawn to a new state where gender is a matter of choice but sexual activity is not, we are turning two other pillars of civilization upside down.”
One Maryland mother of a newborn also told the Baby Zone that she would prefer to see the babies assigned gender at birth.
“Parenting itself is stressful without any other restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she told a parenting website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female genders were called hermaphrodites, after the handsome Greek who had a double sex.
And about a decade ago, the medical community thought that gender was something like a blackboard that could be erased and redrawn.
But now many question the ethical basis of surgery, saying that gender is a complex issue, and doctors can sometimes make the wrong decision because they don’t know how children will feel about their gender when they grow up.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these babies were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The persistent theory of how to treat children of ambiguous sex was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that gender is malleable.
He created a new concept of “gender” and argued that social causes and environmental influences – as parents raised their child – affected children’s genes and hormones and shaped the child regardless of whether they were identified as male or female.
But in one 1966 case, known as “John/Joan,” his theory became controversial.
The parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged due to improper circumcision, he recommended that they let their child completely castrate, remove his testicles and raise him as a girl.
“The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different,” Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, he had his surgery back on the boy and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors still use this model to this day.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these operations emerged “dissatisfaction with the result.”
It was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes but an ambiguous sex organ.
Doctors weren’t sure if he had a big clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that as a man he could never live a “satisfactory life.”
Shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce’s external organs and testicles were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he was given female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
At the age of 18 he was sent for vaginal plastic surgery.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrifying.
After I was born, I was sterilized and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a sex-developmental disorder (DSD) that prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop his genitals.
After learning the truth, he changed back to a man, took doses of testosterone and had his bust removed,
The surgery made him infertile.
Today, she represents others in an organization called the Interface Project and seeks to normalize the perception of those who are intersex.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the California-based Advocates for Informed Choice legal group, worries that German law “calls for stigma and stigma.”
“Many activists fear that German law will achieve this by encouraging parents to make a quick decision and choose ‘indefinite’ for the child,” she said.
We're afraid it'll prompt an intervention.
We believe that it is better to allocate the male or female sex and then wait.
But we don’t know how the law will ultimately sound, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organisation supports Australian law because it "allows adults to choose to be classified as a third gender".
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about the legal gender,” she said.
German law is going to assign it at birth.
This is a battle that a small child should not be seduced at this time.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh-based chest radiologist who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said German law would “grant authority” to both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are defective, Katie's female features have evolved.
He's got a vagina, but he doesn't have a uterus or ovaries.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married and working as an intern in child psychiatry as part of her studies at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogacy.
"The law will give parents some space not to rush their decision," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do certain tests and think it over, and it gives them time to write “man” or “woman.”
In this regard, everything is fine – you raise your child and love him.
You have a wonderful child and you are happy about it.
You don't have to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
“It brings the opportunity to involve the child in decision-making and removes the anxiety that binds parents because they are not sure they are doing the right thing,” she said.
In the end, the child decides which gender they identify with more – and that’s a great thing.
This gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The drunk man poured gasoline over the whole house: he threatened to burn it down with his own family!
Tension increased, fear increased.
The man threatened to burn the house down.
Therefore, all available police patrols in the area, as well as a unit of firefighters from Mladá Boleslav and a unit of the volunteer fire brigade, went to the place.
A police negotiator arrived and tried to talk the man out of his irrational behavior.
The man threatened to set the house on fire.
An intervention unit had to break into the house, disarming the man and imprisoning him.
The aggressor then ended up for examination in the Mladá Boleslav hospital, from where he was transferred to the anti-alcohol interception station.
Firefighters eventually filled the house with gasoline with sorbent, which they later cleaned up.
In addition to the people, all the animals were rescued from the house.
The man did not give in to the police negotiator, so the commando went after him.
Report: Obama's campaign considered swapping Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest aide, according to the New York Times, was secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in 2012.
This revelation is the most significant sensation of the eagerly awaited 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann “Double down: Game Change 2012.”
The Times obtained a copy of the incoming book and reported on Thursday evening that the president’s top aides held intense group meetings and polls at the end of 2011 to gauge whether getting rid of Biden would help revive Obama’s fading hopes for re-election.
According to the National Political Correspondent for the Times, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials inside the campaign and at the White House, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure what effect the election would have on former Secretary of State Clinton’s transition to vice president.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and within the Oval Office.
Only a handful of the president’s closest advisers – including Daley, former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina, and former top White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that this change was being considered.
The book Double down claims that Daley was a representative of the effort to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they eventually decided not to make the move, when data showed that adding Clinton to the list would “not significantly increase Obama’s chances.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I've been researching a lot of things, and this was one of them," Daley told the paper.
You mustn't forget that the president had terrible prospects at the time, so we thought, "Christ, what are we going to do?"
While Daley characterized the research as “due diligence,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested heavily to see if the vote was worth it.
“There’s not a lot of money spent on election campaigns and qualitative research unless something is really seriously considered,” Martin told AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then-boss knew about this potential card shuffling.
While Daley said he didn’t think the president was “aware” of the potential changes, the former chief of staff admitted it was “possible” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double down" definitely does not answer the question of whether the political probe got to Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn’t know about the research into removing Biden from the running mate.
"Maybe," Martin said.
Fantastic ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur made the first ice cream that glows in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a glow-in-the-dark treat.
He came up with the idea after reading a scholarly treatise on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically make a protein that causes lightening.
This ice cream reacts with the language of the consumer – it increases the pH level in the protein and subsequently causes its radiation.
Chris says that ice cream glows when it reacts with the heat of your mouth, and therefore the more you lick, the brighter it shines.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company Lick Me I'm Delicious, says: "It's an amazing substance, but in terms of production, we're at the beginning, so for <0xC2><0xA3>200 you get about 2g of it."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth heats up the protein, the pH level rises and the ice cream begins to glow.
We’ve been testing it over the last few months and it seems like a great idea to celebrate Halloween because it causes this fantastic glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because jellyfish lightening is four times more expensive than gold.
And so each hill costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But it tastes great.
Charlie’s Bristol-based experimental company is known for its unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef, and gold leaf.
But its next product is expected to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I really wish I could make an invisible ice cream."
At its core, this is impossible because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I'm counting on finding some way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By the Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were able to eat sweets, stay awake for a long time, and show off to our neighbors in disguise.
Today, I feel like I've become an asshole.
For two years, no candy appeared in my apartment, and this year will probably not be different.
However, statistics show that when it comes to Halloween, I am a black sheep.
According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), most Americans will celebrate Halloween this year — 158 million of them in fact — and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and ornaments.
But what I always look forward to about Halloween are the trends.
According to the NRF, of the $6.9 billion spent, $1.2 billion is expected to go to costumes.
This year is the last fad of fashion sexy inanimate objects.
It doesn’t just have to be women anymore; it can also be pizza, hamburger, and carrot.
As for the men, I expect to see a lot of zombies thanks to the parade of the dead, and I bet the space men from Daft Punk will make it to our Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with following tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes and to my surprise we were not the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
So he's gonna see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don’t waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion.
That's about 300 million pounds of Hershey tables, lollipops, Milk Dudes and Twizzlers sweets, and Clark bars.
That’s amazing news for the 41 million carolers who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are about to raid our neighborhoods.
In fact, during Halloween, we buy, and believe it or not, we consume, 45 million pounds of chocolate.
The only thing we don’t want is corn candies, and yet, according to the National Association of Confectioneries around Halloween, nearly 16,000 tons of them are being sold.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candies.
That's a secret I've never solved.
Nothing is more typical of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, such as “Terror behind the walls,” “Howl-O-Scream,” and “The House of Shock.”
In fact, there are officially 1,200 haunted houses in the United States, which, according to the American haunted houses company, have a profit of $500 million, and this includes those amazing photos that you are peed on with fears and that your friend will put on Facebook, and you can’t remove them, and the person you like will look at the photo and add a comment like “nice.”
And finally, a little bit about pumpkins.
When we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree – we’ve been doing it since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the “baby in a pumpkin” trend only started last year thanks to the Pinterest app, so most of us grew up carving pumpkins instead of sitting in them.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
The pumpkin lantern with the flickering flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245 thousand tons of pumpkins have grown this year.
If you’re looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon of Napa, California, and try cutting up their pumpkins that weigh almost a ton.
Land Rover Racing Series Announced
The interior has racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as intercommunication devices.
Advanced brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and inter-company vehicle storage are available.
Drew Bowler, Technical Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The race participants who come to Bowler have changed.
Not all of them are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure, as well as an achievable path to world-class racing.
We are delighted to be able to offer them this journey in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience different racing disciplines in the UK and overseas, and that it will prepare competitors for the hardness and reality of Rally Raid races.
We really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge – it will be an exciting competition.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: We have early elections in two years
Karel Schwarzenberg, Chairman of TOP 09, expects another early election soon.
A week after the last one, he told Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz in an interview that there is no other way out, and every government that came out of the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible appendage.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, adding that the life expectancy of the beginning of the parliamentary term is estimated at two years.
Objecting that voters will hardly make a different choice next time, they disagree: "I think it will be a little more balanced decision-making."
At the same time, the TOP 09 chairman does not admit that his party could still lose voters in the next elections as this year (compared to 2010, it lost about 300,000 votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it was clear within two months that early elections would take place, it would strengthen Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>’s ANO 2011 movement.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babi<0xC5><0xA1> will lose.
The turbulent situation in the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, where the chairman Bohuslav Sobotka, after a secret meeting of the party leadership, declared that either he or Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek would remain in the leadership of the social democracy, Schwarzenberg comments in his own way:
“Leading Democratic Party officials like little boys go after the head of state to allow them to take a coup in the party.”
"I thought Mr. Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek was cleverer and more intelligent."
"Because I've never seen something so eagerly stupidly done in my life," the TOP 09 chairman added.
And towards President Zeman (with whom he clashed in the struggle for the presidency) he said: "The role of the head of state is clear: he wants to seize the party."
The first laws have already been submitted by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise of the election for you?
TOP 09 has already formally presented its first draft laws in the House, including the Farsky Register of Treaties, which was discussed by parliamentary committees before the elections, but fell under the table with early elections.
In an interview with Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, the TOP 09 chairman claims that such speed is due to the fact that "these laws are needed".
At the same time, however, TOP 09 clearly wants to overtake similar attempts from other parties.
For example, the election leader of the ANO movement Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in the pre-election struggle of stealing the program of the ANO movement with the idea of introducing a register of contracts.
TOP 09 now took advantage of the lead - she simply dusted off the proposal, which was already on its way to the second reading in the House.
Firefighters arrived to rescue a lost puppy who was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous protrusion in a quarry
Cocker Spaniel Ruby escaped after a small car accident.
Three days later, trapped in a quarry, he was spotted by a man walking a dog.
Firefighters scoured the rock wall to save the dog from certain death.
The puppy was rescued by firefighters, who came to rescue him after he somehow trapped himself on a dangerous protrusion in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
The nine-month-old cocker spaniel Ruby escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived for three days alone until he was released from the quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at Flappit Quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again and to thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After he escaped, when he got into a small accident, feverishly searched for his lost dog and placed challenges on social networks.
At about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a keen-eyed canine spotted Ruby trapped in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from Cleckheaton Fire Station hurried to the scene and swooped down to free Ruby, using an animal carrier to pick him up on the rock.
The expert commander of the technical rescue team, Andy Clayton, said: “The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and bottom.
He did not move his eyebrow during the rescue – he was completely frozen.
But he's okay now.
Then he got the biscuits.
It was a very unusual trip.
The sight of a dog is incredible.
Peter Lau, technical commander of the rescue team, said: “Ruby was very lucky to escape.
There was a chance that he would be seriously injured, or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a check-up, and apart from exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Miss Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "I was afraid to look at the rescue."
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was wonderful to hold him in my arms again.
The vet said that if he got too exhausted and collapsed, he would probably fall.
The firefighters did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We are very grateful to them, they were all just great.
Mr Alderson of Keighley added: “We were afraid it might fall, but it stayed there.”
The firefighters were great.
We just don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger says Katy Perry didn’t leave after 18 years.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she sang backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he went after her.
And she added, "That was a long time ago, and now he's very nice to me."
In a statement Thursday, Jagger’s 70-year-old deputy said he categorically refused to ever make Katy Perry proposals.
The deputy said, "Maybe he's confusing it with someone else."
Perry was one of the guest singers who appeared on the Rolling Stones concert line-up this year.
Her new album “Prism” debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another scary story of independence.
This time there is a warning that the condition for the membership of an independent Scotland in the EU would be its accession to Schengen.
This gave rise to stories of passport checks at Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
The truth is that the Strathclyde newspaper mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as might be expected – this was not reflected in the headlines.
Nor did anyone mention that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws to suit them.
Given that Scotland is not currently in Schengen, the offer of continued inconsistency would be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for anything they really want from the Scots.
So it's a pretty weak story.
And besides, so old that it became an excavation, a journalist's duck, that "independence means passport control," I heard at least 40 years ago.
Yet there is an interesting thought in this bearded tale.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe at all?
Why trade London’s pride for the Brussels pride, especially now?
This is the real European story: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
Due to the euro crisis, the so-called Europe Project is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties dedicated to resistance to the EU or the abolition of the euro as the common currency are gaining influence.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party – founded this year – seems to have come out of nowhere and already won almost five million votes in the September federal elections, effectively sweeping the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
On home soil, there has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with the straitjacket worn on national economies by sticking to the common currency, have led many to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running high budget deficits – this was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is a system of the euro that blocks its members on exchange rates favorable to German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage in terms of domestic production compared to Germany.
The only help is to cut income and public spending – as Germany is calling for.
Behind the current budget and currency problems, there is a deeper cause of Europe's sluggish performance.
As a result of the “green” energy policy supported by Brussels – a code to support French and German companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gasoline as it does in the United States.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Even all the wage freezes in the world would not avert the suffocation of Europe’s petrochemical industry with cheap US shale oil.
The result is a smouldering revolt, especially in France, once an enthusiastic supporter of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as an instrument that would keep Germany in check and allow Paris to rise to Washington’s level in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a proof of political legitimacy and has pushed its own economic policy in Europe and left the worn-out French economy to its fate.
Result: Marine Le Pen’s right wing, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial additional election and pushed the ruling Socialists to third place.
With 24% of the vote, the Front is now the most popular party in France – an early warning to British Labour that they cannot conclude that a split on the right will automatically have a positive effect on the left.
How does Le Pen deal with her newfound popularity among the white working class?
She would like to use next year's European elections to create an anti-European bloc working against the common currency across the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties do well in this election, which is likely, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time in history.
I think that in the near future, a growing anti-European feeling and attitude against the common currency will unite and the euro will be destroyed.
The EU will not disappear, but rather transform itself into something more free in the sense of “Europe of the (sovereign) nations”, as General de Gaulle preferred.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project and join the United States.
However, Washington’s increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
Where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area (in principle) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – this includes the possibility of announcing to Berlin and Brussels when they should leave us alone.
I assume that Scotland would do well in a relaxed European order, provided that it retains its own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take the example of Norway and keep our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – oddly enough – the most successful non-austerity political movement in Europe, winning by a large majority in 2011 thanks to the opposition to cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the following coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now voted for independence only to take austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Older Adults
Research has shown that African-American and Hispanic women reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
Physical changes don’t mean puberty is coming.
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are behind this.
Experts say that one of the triggers of earlier puberty may be the epidemic of obesity.
The trend of early puberty is not so noticeable in boys.
Former CNN reporter Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children’s health and family issues.
Should a mother be horrified when her daughter begins to grow breasts and pubescence at the age of 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
“I spent a lot of time assuring my parents that this is usually not a sign of a rapid development toward full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, pubic and underarm hair and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
Over the past forty years, however, there has been only a small shift in the age at which the first menstruation occurs.
In the United States, the average age is now 12.5 years old compared to the age of 12.75 years in 1970.
“When breasts begin to develop, it will be at least two to three years before the first menstruation occurs,” said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of “Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.”
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is time.
It is discussed what activates the actual onset of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of 8, the girl is considered "prematurely mature."
In most cases, the process slows down or stops – which can be carefully monitored by the child’s doctor.
Faster growth may be a reason for the endocrinologist to perform tests to rule out serious problems such as a tumor or cyst.
There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones, which can eventually lead to a halt in growth and stunting in adulthood.
Recommendations for drugs and hormonal treatment depend on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
When it comes to drug use, Kaplowitz is cautious, but admits that “repression of puberty can alleviate problems with a girl’s behavior and her feelings of being different from her peers.”
Another big problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to menstruate.
"They're worried that he might get pregnant or how he'll handle hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter began menstruating at the age of 10.
Although there were hints and we talked about menstruation together, she wasn’t ready emotionally.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is still no consistent body of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the most serious cause is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped carry out a study on girls ages 6 to 9 that linked body fat to puberty timing.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic women tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
The explanations are different.
From a global perspective, early puberty patterns seem to be affected by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys develop facial and pubic hair at a young age, the trend towards full-blown early puberty is not as clear as it is for girls.
Other doctors attending the American Association of Pediatric Physicians (AAP) conference added further complexity to the topic.
Acne and pubic hair are common even in infants and toddlers.
“We have to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty,” said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryebsk Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get instructions from their child’s doctor on how to talk to their child.
"It may mean having to talk to the child sooner than you think," Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, your child will probably respond well.
Girls who develop earlier need reassurance that even if it happens prematurely, this process is a normal part of life.
Nadia Konvalinkova in the role of a pub.
Does he have a new job?
Actress Nad<0xC4><0x9B>a Konvalinková (62) appeared behind the bar in the role of a pub and she was very good at it.
Is it possible that the popular Czech actress planned to change her profession and set out to do business in a pub?
Nadia Konvalinkova appeared in the James Joyce Irish pub and brewed beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I did it right away.
Even my boss offered to hire me and I could make a living by turning a beer.
But I refused, I prefer to stay with what I do to this day, in acting," said Konvalinková, who was a guest at the 20th anniversary of the Irish pub.
"I like Irish beer and I'm going to have Irish whiskey here," she said.
Nadi, a longtime friend and colleague Pavel Nov<0xC3><0xBD>, also appeared at the event.
I'm dead, and I'm not allowed to drink in my current new life.
I’m allowed one beer or one drink a day, and that’s what I’m trying to do.”
Aircraft manufacturers are arguing about the width of the seats, big orders are at stake
The dispute over the width of second-class seats for long-haul flights has flared up among leading aircraft manufacturers, prompting a bitter exchange of views on the Dubai air show this month.
The dispute concerns the width of the seats provided for long-haul flights for the economy class – not exactly the one that would normally be preceded by airlines, but whose allotted space is key to the efficiency requirements of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industry standards that would offer at least 46-cm-wide seats in economy class, but U.S. rival Boeing says airlines should decide.
The dispute comes as aircraft manufacturers compete to sell the largest version of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, with a potential record number of orders expected during the November 17-21 event.
The way the rear of the aircraft is laid out – especially whether there are 9 or 10 seats next to each other – is the basis of the economic performance requirements for the design of new “mini-jumbo” aircraft.
Boeing says the upgraded 777X will carry 406 people in economy seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread out 10 in each row.
Airbus says a competing version of its A350 model will carry 350 people in 46 cm-wide economy seats spread out over 9.
Giant aircraft often attack each other on technical issues through advertisements in professional media.
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to gain the upper hand with more than 100 orders.
He recently previewed what could be the start of a new advertising war when he showed financiers a picture showing three people crowded into a restaurant with the caption “Would you like it?”
“Boeing promotes long-haul flights in seats narrower than those in regional turboprop aircraft,” said John Leahy, Airbus’ head of sales.
As the eating habits change, people are bigger, but the seats on the planes have not changed radically.
Since the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul air travel, by the turn of the century, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the weight of the average American between the ages of 40 and 49 has increased by 10 percent.
According to American health statistics, the average American in the 21st century has a waist of 100 cm.
Airbus claims that its rival adheres to the concept of seats from the 1950s, when the average width of the seats of the newly christened aircraft was lower.
Airbus says it has conducted research that suggests extending the seat by 2.5cm will improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing rejects the size of Airbus seats and says it is not in the hands of aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says research shows that the cabin experience depends on more than just the width of the seat.
“It’s really about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do the things they believe they need to do to be successful,” said cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us dictating to them what profits them.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, more elbow space is essential, but for suppliers, this is a growing problem that can affect revenue.
Behind this dispute is a race to order aircraft with estimated trade in the coming decades worth at least $700 billion in catalog prices, enough to tip the scales of American and European exports.
As Reuters reported in July, the layout of the seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to achieve 20 percent better efficiency in their latest designs of twin-engine long-haul aircraft than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing’s performance requirements depend in part on a comparison of the design of the 777X with 10 seats in a row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
The profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10-seater concept.
“The reason Boeing is doing this is to inflate more seats and make their aircraft more competitive against our products,” said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Airbus Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say the 10-seater cabins in line for existing 777 models are consistent with the fact that many passengers are for a denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
“A forty-five-centimetre-wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from a business point of view, Airbus’ design is motivated by the threat of the 777,” said Mary Kirby, interior design expert and founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer airlines a catalogue of suppliers to choose from.
Sceptical aircraft dealers even carry a measuring band with them to check the competitive layout.
While boasting comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-density aircraft for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus is offering the A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it hasn’t sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for more cabin modifications by offering some of its aircraft wider aisle seats.
Experts say that without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industrial standards will remain unanswered, but it can discourage the wave of sales of the 777X.
Number of HIV-infected exceeds 1,000 in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected people is increasing every year.
For example, in 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121, and in 2010 there were 180.
Last year, 212 people were infected and it was a record number.
"There is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," said Miroslav Hlavat<0xC3><0xBD>, an expert on AIDS, who led the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
According to him, last year from January to September, 165 patients with HIV increased in the country, this year for the same period there were 176.
From the beginning of the monitoring until the end of September this year, tests confirmed HIV in 1,710 men and 353 women, with the most infected being in Prague.
Their number in September reached 1005.
There were 206 infected people in the Central Bohemian Region.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from the Moravian-Silesian Region and 116 from the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem Region.
The least infected are from the Highlands, there were 19 of them.
A total of 88 percent of patients became infected during sex.
Fourteen people have been infected by blood transfusions in the past.
However, such a case has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, i.e. more than a quarter of a century ago.
Six children were also born with HIV and passed on from their mother.
There’s a lot of nonsense in Gravity, but the spectacle is beautiful, experts say
A fantastic film from the universe of Gravity sold out cinemas in the Czech Republic some time after its premiere.
According to the Union of Film Distributors, it was seen by almost 150,000 viewers in October and earned over 26 million crowns.
Most reviews rate the film positively.
However, there are some inconsistencies in it.
Lidovky.cz asked astronomers and astrophysicists how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek (director of the Observatory and Planetarium Brno): I like science fiction films, which I consider to be modern, dreamy fairy tales.
The film Gravity is not excluded, although it looks like a "physically real" performance.
It's not, but that doesn't mean it's bad.
I enjoyed it a lot.
You may notice, for example, the hair of Sandra Bullock, which somehow does not float in a state of weightlessness.
The Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station are moving in vastly different orbits, so they cannot be seen in one shot.
Some viewers of the film blame the unrealistic effect and in general the whole behavior of fire in a state of weightlessness.
The suits wouldn't have been able to withstand such blows, either, they said.
Heroes in the film Gravity often get into collision with various objects, and suits without much difficulty will withstand everything.
Criticism was not spared either.
Such a large-scale tragedy in the Earth’s orbit is, according to some debaters, unrealistic.
She also wonders why the doctor was sent into space to repair the technique.
People also argue on forums about the "unrealistic" behavior of ropes.
It looks like it was designed for bungee jumping.
Marcel Gr<0xC3><0xBC>n (director of the Prague Observatory and Planetarium): I have only seen him on the wide screen so far, but I can definitely say that I was enchanted.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary, but science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost an obligation) not to adhere to reality consistently.
"More than the irregularities you mentioned, I was touched by the fact that the space station is shown three times with a degrading level of technology (last time Chinese)."
"After all, China won't be around until the end of the decade, and it's probably going to look better than it does in the movie."
Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, the authors very successfully try not to violate the laws of physics, and so the science-oriented viewer will appreciate that during various cosmic collisions and collisions the moment of momentum is quite correctly preserved, in the dictionary of physics, and the view of the Earth from space is also very real.
Imperfections will certainly be found in a more detailed examination.
In addition, for example, when reading the comments, I found that the preferred direction of circulation of various space debris in orbit in some scenes seems to be reversed than it should be (from west to east).
Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pán (employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things the creators have adapted to their needs, but none of the fundamental and calling to heaven transgression against logic or natural laws I have not noticed in the film and compared to other films of similar focus it is evident that the creators have taken care of the credibility of the events shown.
Of the moments that do not make sense, it is worth mentioning the fact that the Hubble Space Telescope orbits in a different inclined orbit than the ISS.
As a result, there is a significant difference in speed, and the rescue operation could not actually have taken place as it was shown in the film.
Further, in the moment of separation of Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock), I did not notice that the entire ISS rotated, so there is no clear origin of the force acting on Kowalski, which forces both actors to let go at the moment when they are no longer moving towards each other.
New nicotine vaccine may take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine that can take away the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mouse from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Further tests are needed before human trials, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell School of Medicine in New York says the first indications are good.
“We strongly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit and exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine addiction is so strong that it overcomes all current approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry genetic information to create anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of these antibodies.
Antibodies chase all the nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, thus preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine hit.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice, which were additionally supplied with nicotine, continued their normal activities.
But the mice that were not vaccinated “calmed down,” the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had gotten into their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be given frequently enough to maintain sufficient antibody levels to prove costly and impractical.
The cost of a new vaccine should be much lower because it converts liver cells into factories for making antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines were completely safe for humans, they could be given to children before they want to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
However, smokers are much more likely to use it to quit.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t get any benefit from the nicotine vaccine, and that will help them get rid of this habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but cautioned that more research is needed.
Tripodi denies that he was influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Committee for Oversight of Corruption.
Former New South Wales Secretary of State Joe Tripodi has denied that he would change the coastal lease policy at the request of his political adviser Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three government-controlled properties.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Committee (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid lobbied several state ministers to have his lease on Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a café, renewed without having to take part in a tender after it expired in August 2005.
The Committee is now investigating allegations that Mr Tripodi was aware of Mr Obeid's secret interests in these properties, on the basis of evidence presented on Thursday by Mr Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of talks launched in 2005, the government pushed for public tendering.
The tenants were against this and also wanted longer-term contractual terms.
In 2009, leases for businesses in Circular Quay, which brought the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need to participate in a public tender.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a supporter of public tenders.
But he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi admitted, insisted on a shift in government rent policy.
The transcript of the calls submitted to the ICAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr. Obeid and Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the port resort after working under Mr. Obeid in the fisheries department.
"Was the subject of the conversations during these telephone calls the development of commercial leasing policy?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr Tripodi.
'No, 'said Mr Tripodi.
I can't remember what we talked about, but definitely not this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes attack target in Syria, official says
Israeli warplanes struck a target in the Syrian port of Lazikiya on Thursday night, a senior administration official told Fox News.
The official did not specifically say what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was a Russian-made SA-125 missile.
At least twice this year, Israel carried out an air strike on the supply of missiles in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and it's different.
For example, the commentator Pechinko spoke in such a way that it was possible to agree with it, while the chairman <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>ch fanned discord.
Hetman Chovanec was a suspect to me as soon as he was elected to the Bureau, and he confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and continues to be, a symbol of this misery of the CSSD.
The rest of the guys showed their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and readable and inapplicable; Vice-Chairman Zaorálek has been prevented the most by television interviews.
On this basis, I see no better option than for the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD to propose to the Vice-President of the Senate Gajd<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xA1>ková as Prime Minister, the only one would not have an initial handicap and I think it would perform as standard.
This is such a good solution that hardly anyone from the leadership will support it.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and continue without tearing the party apart.
Alena Gajd<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xA1>ková could have formed a minority government without fear, with only the blessing of President Babi<0xC5><0xA1> and without the populists, but with the people’s health minister Hovorka, who is actually a believing social democrat.
This mini-minority government would have great stability, because it would enforce a proper referendum law, and President <0xC3><0x9A>svita Okamura has pledged to support such a law.
President Babi<0xC5><0xA1> would eventually come to terms with the progress of taxes, because he is smart and will see that it is impossible without her.
The people would not bring trouble, because the Speaker is the bearer of the best that they have, and otherwise they would not be in the government.
The same is true of YES, and a valuable minister would be found here, but if they do not reasonably want to enter into risky government participation, but provide support, well too.
Let's give Alena Gajdo<0xC5><0xA1>ková courage!
Foreign workers with a visa permit may undergo a “legitimacy” test
As the government intends to expand police interventions, it is considering a “legitimacy” test for foreign workers with a 457 visa permit.
The test, if accepted, will be applied through criteria to prevent the 457 program from being used to fill unskilled jobs or as a back door for moving family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion paper was published today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned the government’s rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia’s neighbours.
“The loud statements ‘foreigners at the end of the line’ and ‘work first for the Australians’ are a very unpleasant relic of a time when unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australian-Indian Institute.
Historically, this meant that a white labor force was to be protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised if anyone in the region recorded an echo of this historic artifact.
The article discusses 12 measures previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he is dealing with officials for human smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes and the rest remain to be considered.
If the ‘eligibility’ criteria are adopted, visa applicants may be examined in detail as to whether ‘the nomination is justified in a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or a personal relationship with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking’.
Following previous experience with businesses that intended to sponsor a small number of staff but then employed hundreds, businesses may also be required to justify the number of 457 visa holders.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan man seeking asylum has died on suspicion of having a heart attack after arriving on an asylum boat to the Christmas Islands this week.
The man’s nine-year-old frightened son traveled to Australia with him, and after his father’s death on Wednesday, he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities rushed the man to a hospital in the Christmas Islands, where he died.
The British government has announced a study that aims to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
HS2’s work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England will begin as soon as the first phase launches in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "bring the UK together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the British government on the plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train service between London and the West Midlands.
Once Phase Two is completed, the route from Manchester to Leeds will run.
In June, the government reassessed the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The British government, which has been in talks with the national transport office Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 to identify additional rail capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is really a national network that better connects the UK and its cities.”
We gave SH2 the green light because the benefit it will bring is huge.
Without it, we face a crisis in the capacity of our rail network.
But it’s also about connectivity – with HS2, 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh will be better connected across the UK.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael said: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to “clearly” support Scotland’s inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “The high-speed line has the potential to bring Scotland immeasurable economic benefits, but it also supplies the economic weight of Scotland in the overall case of high-speed rail across the UK.”
We are therefore excited to work with the British Government to explore the possibility of bringing high-speed rail to Scotland to benefit all and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is planning anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study with the British ministers over the next year and to jointly deciding on the next steps.
Together with Bárta, the Anti-Corruption Police Inspectorate and Analysts Arrested
Information about the arrest of V<0xC3><0xAD>t Bárta began to spread on Thursday evening, when the message was brought by the server Prvn<0xC3><0xAD>zpravy.cz.
MF DNES soon found out that the General Inspectorate of Security Forces (GIBS) was in charge of the case, and its people were supposed to arrest Bárta in the center of Prague.
It took place in front of the Four Seasons Hotel.
The Inspectorate deals with cases where there are police officers among the accused, but its jurisdiction also applies to civilians.
According to the MF DNES, one of the arrested officers of the anti-corruption police is Jan Petr<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>lek, the chief analyst and computer scientist.
He previously worked for the Security Information Service.
Anti-corruption police spokesman Jaroslav Ibehej, however, refused to comment on the information, saying that the media must turn to GIBS in this matter.
However, her spokesman, Radka Sandorová, did not want to say anything about the case, referring it to the Municipal State Prosecutor’s Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified information," said <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánka Zenklová, a spokeswoman for the Czech Parliament.
It can also be inferred from this vague reaction that the event took place, but it is in a regime of secrecy that does not allow the speakers to say anything specific.
Bárta’s lawyer, Old<0xC5><0x99>ich Chudoba, is in a similar situation.
He told the media that he represented Bárta "in this matter as well", but given that this is classified information, he could not confirm or deny Bárta's arrest.
At first, some media speculated that Bart’s arrest might be related to former police president Peter Lessy.
He was promoted to the post of Bárta together with former President of the VV Radek John, who sat at the head of the Ministry of the Interior.
The dispute, which broke out because of this between the ex-prime minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as and the VV, even had to be resolved by the then president Václav Klaus.
I have no idea where this connection came from.
No one contacted me, I was not interrogated.
"I really don't know anything about things," Lessy told iDNES.cz.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
He was officially promoted by Radek John, the real leader of the party, but at that time it was Barta.
Bárta is now running for election for the Dawn Movement, but his mandate has been narrowly missed by 175 votes.
Dawn leader Tomio Okamura said he had no idea what was going on.
"V<0xC3><0xAD>t Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties on our candidate list and, as I have repeatedly said before the elections, he was not a member of Tomio Okamura's Dawn of Direct Democracy," he said, distancing himself from Bárta Okamura, who said before the elections that he had given Bárta the space to run for the Dawn because he had helped him solve the problem of the executors.
V<0xC3><0xAD>t Bárta found himself in court in 2012 with his former co-party member from VV Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>kárka.
Rules on the use of electronic devices in aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Passengers of Australian airlines will continue to be required to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, regardless of changes in the US to ease regulations on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given U.S. companies the space to change their practices so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight if the devices remain in “air” mode.
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people find it annoying that they cannot access their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires a lot of work from US carriers to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they have no plans to change their practices in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said it had examined the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight are still in place in Australia.
“CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,” he said.
This issue is covered by regulations that require aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, which has already spoken to CASA about expanding the use of its on-board Wi-Fi entertainment system, was in favour of the change but announced it would submit to a decision by the regulator.
“We would welcome CASA to do an analysis of the permission to use electronic devices, because we really think that now that we have [wireless onboard entertainment] it would improve the customer experience,” the spokesperson said.
Qantas has announced that it will comply with current regulations for the time being.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices must not be used during takeoff and landing, and we do not intend to change that anytime soon,” he said.
The FAA rules apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are constantly interested in developments in the regulatory field that may be useful to our passengers, and we will certainly carefully study the FAA’s decisions and the reasons behind them.
In the case of U.S. carriers, the impact of the regulations will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile phones, as well as revise manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and passenger information.
“Once an airline has confirmed its fleet’s tolerance, it can allow passengers to use portable and lightweight electronic devices, such as tablets, electronic readers and smartphones, at any altitude,” the FAA said in a statement.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will order passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be stored safely under the seats or in overhead storage during take-off and descent.
With the growing poverty of the middle class, pawnshops in Singapore are booming
Janani Amirthalinga stops a gold bracelet, a ring and earrings at a pawn shop at the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore to pay her daughter’s tuition.
“My husband and I just bought a house and I put all my money into it,” Amirthalinga said.
Although she receives $2,400 a month as an administrator ($3,000 SGD) and her husband also works, the family’s monthly income is insufficient, she says.
Indeed, demand across areas in Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – is such that ValueMax, where the woman conducts her transaction, became the third-highest-ranked company on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Stopping jewelry is not only a quick way to borrow cash – SGD 1,300 in Amirthalinga’s case – but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Singapore pawnshops typically apply an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping mall.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require verification of the person (payment history) or proof of income, and can provide a loan faster than banks.
As families feel pressured by rising living costs and rising household and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit backed by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to deal with the worsening financial situation.
This week, Standard & Poor’s cited the increasing use of credit in households, primarily due to rising rents, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia, she said.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with a ratio of 80 percent of GDP, an increase from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists were also worried about Thailand’s high level of consumer debt, which just so happened to have gotten out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed continued weak exports and weakening consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that with rising costs, people from the middle to the low [income scale] will try to supplement their income wherever they can,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at Malaysia’s CIMB bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have contributed to people rushing to stop their personal property and taking advantage of the opportunity to exchange their family jewelry for cash.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 city pawnshops are gold.
People say the price of gold looks good, we stop Grandma's gold necklace and get it back next month.
Thailand’s largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its pawnshop in recent months.
Growth in the mortgage industry is so strong that ValueMax, the operator of a branch in downtown Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also outside Asia, says ValueMax CEO Lee Ching.
The company will fund this by using 60 percent of the SGD 66 million it raised on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discount lenders have come under fire for high interest rates, Mrs. Yeah says the pledge not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but it also does not directly raise the debt.
“Customers stop items they already own, and monetizing personal assets doesn’t increase household debt,” he says.
In society, liens are increasingly accepted as a means of securing short-term, secured financing.
Among those who use pawnshops, it is not just people in financial need.
Wealthy people from Singapore also use ValueMax branches when stopping gold bars or Rolex watches, and can get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are from every possible situation.
“These include wealthy individuals who need to borrow on a short-term basis because of their daring trades or investments, or small businesses that need help solving problems in their cash flow,” says Mrs. Yeah.
Sometimes you just need the money as soon as possible.
A $325 million rescue package for the Tasmanian health service
The federal government is insisting that the $325 million rescue package for Tasmania’s struggling health care system contain harsh conditions that ensure the state government doesn’t squander funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek said Australia was taking "accelerated measures" to avert a crisis caused by the island's aging population, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
The funding for four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has come up with an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state,” Plibersek said.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for surgery at the patient’s request.
A further 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgery, will help to remove the debt.
The money is also available for open clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-operative care, training of health specialists, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic systems of medical records in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to ideas that leading clinicians have told me will best help the Tasmanian health system,” Plibersek said.
The Minister stressed that the Tasmanian government must require a strict reporting regime and record-keeping obligations.
The state will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive Australian Union money, and to report monthly on where the additional funds have been spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the state delivers services as efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would be of no use “until there is real reform to lay a more sustainable foundation for Tasmania’s public health system.”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for its response to his request for urgent assistance, which he first raised in talks with the prime minister in early May.
"I believe that the federal relief package can relieve the state's public health service of a critical condition," Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional elected procedures will significantly reverse the recent cuts.
Federal health opposition spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s statement is just a “patch.”
“The reason I’m here is because the Labour government took $430 million out of our health care system,” he told ABC TV.
You can’t have a government that takes away almost half a billion dollars and an Australian Union that donates 300 million dollars and pretend it’s good news.
Mr Dutton called on Mrs Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout would be spent on higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux adapted Denis Diderot’s novella, which brings an exceptional cinematic journey and portrayal of the times, but is also more boring than it should be.
Set in France in the 1860s, it tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman who is sent to a convent by her family.
When he revolts, he experiences extremely cruel treatment from the reprehensible mother superior, and for another becomes the object of sexual passion.
The film never slips into lasciviousness or sensationalism, and that is its problem.
The ceremonial character of this story leads to the fact that even the audience will experience torment similar to wearing a linen shirt.

Syria has destroyed its means to produce chemical weapons, says monitoring body
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, the global chemical weapons watchdog said on Thursday, as violent conflicts erupted in the north of the country near one of the sites where the suspected poisons are stored.
A Syrian activist group said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the civil war began nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before 1 November,
the date set by the Hague-based organisation for Damascus to destroy or disable all chemical weapons production facilities and chemical mixing machinery for the purpose of producing poison gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this, in principle, initial phase of destruction is a significant milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to start destroying existing weapons and supplies.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came as fighting raged in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons factory and storage facilities, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
A group of activists monitoring the overall death toll through a network of activists in Syria announced on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are expected to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, there are 29,954 members of Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 militiamen from Lebanon’s Hezbollah.
Among the dead were 2,202 government defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since.
The conflict has forced some 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad’s forces have been fighting rebels in Safira, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda, for weeks.
The Observatory said on Thursday that the losses were on both sides, but it did not have specific numbers.
The fighting underscores the danger facing chemical weapons inspectors, who face tight deadlines in their mission to rid Syria of its chemical arsenal amid the ongoing civil war.
A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the UN, said its team was now “satisfied to have verified – and monitored – the Syrian declared essential production and mixing/filling equipment”.
He added that “no further monitoring activities are currently planned.”
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were unable to visit the two sites due to security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites had been “abandoned and ... the items of the chemical weapons program that it contained were moved to two other declared sites that were inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the Safira facility was one of those places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed on a plan to completely destroy its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW executive committee next month.
“I bow to the courage and bravery that you have shown in carrying out this most demanding mission this organization has ever had,” said Ahmet Uzumcu, director of the OPCW’s observer mission.
Now in its third year, the Sunni Muslim rebels and the Assad government, with their security forces full of Alawite sect members, a branch of Shiite Islam, are facing off in a civil war.
As for further developments, the head of the Observatory, Rami Abdul Rahman, said there was a strong explosion inside the air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Lazikiya on Wednesday.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger at the verdict handed down on the founder of the Bali bombing
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the verdict against the last of the founders who were brought to justice, saying Umar Patek should have been executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia’s most wanted fugitives, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for assembling explosive devices that were used in a bomb attack.
He could be released on parole in 15 years.
The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of several other terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecution demanded life, although it could insist that a man nicknamed "Demolition man" be given the death penalty because of his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of explosives.
The decision rekindled the painful memories of June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in a devastating attack launched by Patek and others nearly a decade ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
Ms Corteen told the AAP news agency: “He should be put in front of a firing squad.”
Every day I have to live with the fact that I will not see other grandchildren and my daughters.
Sari was razed to the ground on 12 October 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., when a heavy charge was detonated in an outside parked van.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy Bar, where a suicide bomber detonated a backpack filled with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while he was kept alive, he "died" three times to the doctors.
Mr Hughes said Patek should face the same fate as the three other members of the Jama’a Islamiya terror cell responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one else.
Keeping him alive... there's no reason to keep him alive, there just isn't.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others isn't that much.
Patek was the last person to be tried in Bali.
He eluded capture for nearly a decade, but was eventually captured in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish links between terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't give up voluntarily," said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he has not felt regret for how much grief he has caused to others.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year, which will include ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"We're going to see a lot of tears this year," said Mrs. Corteen.
Patek can still appeal the verdict.
FAA: Air Passengers Can Now Use Technology Gains on Airplanes (But Can't Call From Their Cell Phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices “gate-to-gate” – in addition to calling from their mobile phones – to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music based on the eagerly awaited new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect the changes to occur immediately.
How quickly the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta told a news conference.
Airlines will have to demonstrate to the FAA to the extent that their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated the cabin crew training manuals and storage guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among the companies that have already handed over the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the status of such a plan, we can improve the widespread use of electronic devices very quickly,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain issues a permit.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the aircraft is descending to land and not turn them on until the aircraft is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference can allow their passengers to use their devices during takeoff, landing and boarding, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wifi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stewardesses, welcomed the changes.
“Once the new rules are safely in place – and we are working closely with transport companies on this – it will be a success,” Glading said in a statement.
To be honest, we are tired of looking like “guardians.”
However, surfing the internet, sending emails and texting or downloading data will continue to be banned below 3km altitude, the agency said.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to flight mode.
So still no Words with friends, the online scrabble game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he was, as is well known, fired from an American Airlines plane because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will have to continue to be stored because of fears they could hurt someone if they flew around the cabin.
Cell phone calls will continue to be banned on board.
The rules for the use of mobile phones are not set by the FAA, but by the US Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert at CBS News, said that mobile phones continue to be considered a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but we also know from FCC data that they can cause interference to broadcasting towers in the air,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to look into the issue proposed last month that the government allow wider use of electronic devices.
The FAA has been pressured in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, argue that there is no legitimate security reason for this ban.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce, as the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the obligation to turn off their devices.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to the disruption of navigation and communication equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, a technical accessory of the time.
New airlines are much more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years now, airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes.
Wi-Fi-friendly plans are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should adapt to greater use of electronic devices under the new rules, Huert said.
Current electronic devices generally emit much less intense radio transmissions than previous generation devices.
For example, electronic readers emit only minimal broadcasts when turning the page.
But broadcasting is more powerful when devices download or send data.
Among those pushing to loosen restrictions on the use of these devices by travelers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of this company loaded a commercial aircraft with their Kindle electronic readers and conducted a test flight, but no problem appeared.
Members of the FAA’s advisory committee have expressed mixed feelings about whether these devices pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd, of the National Airline Passengers Association, said he believes the interference from these devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee have stated that there are only fragmentary reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause interference to aeronautical systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off their devices during low-visibility flight.
The travel industry group has welcomed these changes and says it is a sensible approach for the travelling public, which uses the technology extensively.
“We are pleased that the FAA has recognized that a pleasant travel experience is not at odds with safety,” said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was airlifted from a drilling rig in the North Sea and released back into nature
The bird was transported to the coast after it was found exhausted on an oil rig in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One of the rattlesnake was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after being treated by Scotland’s SPCA in a rescue centre until he recovered.
Operations Center Colin Seddon said: “This rattlesnake probably migrated from northern Europe when it was caught by a strong wind over the North Sea.”
Apparently, he ran out of strength and found refuge on the oil platform.
Mr Seddon added: “He was unable to take off again, so they contacted us for help.”
By the time the rattle was released, he was in good condition and healthy.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a promise to bring businesses together and define what changes British entrepreneurs and job-creating companies want to see in their relationship with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey in which leading UK entrepreneurs were asked about their views on the UK, trade and the EU.
YouGov surveyed 1,000 business leaders representing UK businesses of all sizes and from all sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while EU countries are stagnating.
They want to see the government preferring new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than getting bogged down in a long and arduous process of reforming mysterious European institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy areas – from monopoly regulations to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
There was widespread dissatisfaction with the single market, and entrepreneurs said that the cost of Brussels regulations now outweighed the benefits of being part of the European business area – 40 percent of large businesses, traditionally the most pro-European, agreed.
Finally, our survey of business leaders revealed the most telling insight, namely that the clear majority wants Britain to seek to change the treaty and relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The finding, which identified businesses of various sizes and major business groups, shows that the business sector is pushing for a “meaningful change” that will shift the impact back to the UK.
There is a lot at stake – reaching a treaty change and a better deal for Britain could mean a gain of up to 16% on the vote in the referendum to stay in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan to amend the terms of British EU membership.
It also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to mark a significant shift from the current balance of power back towards the UK.
A better deal for Britain is possible and, as the eurozone embarks on the road to a closer economic and fiscal union, increasingly necessary.
Jobs and growth in the UK must be a priority, and as our survey results show, for business this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
John Kerry: Spying has gone too far
The United States has sometimes gone too far in spying, US Foreign Secretary John Kerry admitted during a video conference between Washington and London.
According to the minister, however, the collection of information served to deter terrorist attacks.
The “first confession from Washington,” according to AFP, came amid fierce polemics on both sides of the Atlantic over scandalous revelations about mass surveillance by the US National Security Agency (NSA), which US allies have also been targeted.
“In some cases, I admit, as the president has done, some of these actions have gone too far, and we make sure that doesn’t happen in the future,” Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he mainly defended his previous practice.
According to him, the collection of information is necessary to combat terrorism and prevent assassinations, such as the attacks of September 11, 2001 in the United States, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and in London in July 2005.
“We prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being killed because we were able to be informed of the assassinations in time,” Kerry said.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases went disproportionately far".
The affair over US intelligence, which reportedly monitored hundreds of millions of phone calls, broke out in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans were also monitoring the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
European leaders did not hide their outrage, and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that would prohibit or significantly restrict surveillance.
Alexey Miller of Gazprom says Bulgaria’s pipeline is ushering in a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria means the launch of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, the director of Gazprom said.
“Today we are witnessing a milestone: construction on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add variety to Russia’s export routes across Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of Russia’s gas to Europe, adds to the risks of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “forever” removed.
Once the entire project is operational in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream gas pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says the construction is to start in other countries in the direction of the flow at the end of this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
A decisive battle awaits them.
The Lebanese Hezbollah movement has deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle over the mountainous area of Kalamoun.
According to increasingly detailed reports, Israel destroyed rockets destined for Hezbollah during Wednesday’s air strikes on two locations in western Syria.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the army there.
Its agenda is also the fight against Israel, which does not interfere in the Syrian conflict, but has made clear that it will prevent the transfer of weapons to Hezbollah’s hands in Lebanon.
Reports of Wednesday’s Israeli raids on weapons depots in western Syria are still being refined.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but U.S. sources confirmed it.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, missiles fired from the Mediterranean hit the Syrian Sn<0xC3><0xBA>bar Jabla missile base south of Latakia.
The al-Arabiya news station said two depots were hit where the missiles were ready to be transported to Lebanon.
According to her sources, these were Russian-made SA-8 missiles.
Israel declined to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron ben Yishai said Syria was continuously trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles and the Syrian air force was teaching members of Hezbollah's armed section how to handle missiles.
The SA-8s are obsolete missiles that the Syrian army has had since the 1980s.
They are located on a movable chassis.
Although they are quite primitive, thanks to their mobility and small size, they can be easily hidden.
They are equipped with a radar, which turns off after firing the missile, so it is difficult to target them.
Latakia is located in western Syria, in an area inhabited by ruling Alawites.
It is a well-guarded area and Hezbollah has been involved in fighting in western Syria in the past.
It claims to help protect the Syrian Shiite community, to which the Alawites belong.
Now it is reported that 15,000 of its fighters are ready to help the army recapture Kalamoun.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also strengthening its forces there.
Kalamoun is located between Damascus and Homs, the third largest city in the country.
The battle, according to an al-Arabiya source, is to be in retaliation for the opposition’s recent attack on the headquarters of the Syrian Shiite brigade abu Fadl Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hezbollah has helped the Syrian army recapture the town of Qusayr on the Lebanese border this year.
Many of the rebels from Kusair have just left for Kalamoun.
Until recently, it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
Corruption, spending money on overpriced purchases and government contracts, tax increases and, last but not least, government scandals were cited as the reasons.
According to the results of the elections, it can be concluded that the majority of citizens were satisfied with this state of affairs.
That they actually did not mind and with the state that was here (the theft and indebtedness of this state), they were actually satisfied.
Otherwise, I cannot explain that 3 413 497 voters did not show up for the elections, 596 357 voters voted TOP 09 384 174 voters voted ODS in total so 4 394 028 actually supported the original government coalition, which represents 52.16% of all eligible voters.
That is a half-majority.
When I add 1,016,829 <0xC4><0x8C>SSD voters to the above-mentioned parties, then with the old order (because all these parties participated in the "stealing" and indebtedness of this state), then 64.23% of eligible voters actually agreed with this state of affairs.
In fact, the majority of voters have made it clear that they are not looted and over-indebted to punish the perpetrators of this state.
Or do you think that the members of the CSSD who participated in this will advocate for appropriate laws?

The Royal Commission learned that two employees of the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) were charged before the lawsuits against Jonathan Lord.
The Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse has learned that two employees of the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were charged with child sexual abuse before charges were brought against child educator Jonathan Lord of the town of Caringbah in 2011.
But before the commission, it was reported that in its initial statement to the commission, the association stated that they had never dealt with a case of child sexual abuse in their organization.
Chief Executive Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which one YMCA employee was accused of child pornography offences and another in which a YMCA gymnast in Caringbah was convicted in 1991 of sexually harassing children in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gaila Furness, an adviser to the commission, that he knew about the first case, but not about the second.
He admitted that YMCA’s initial statement was also inaccurate when it stated that external audits had been carried out at YMCA, which praised the organization as a leading advocate for children’s rights.
The evidence presented by the commission suggests that YMCA was alerted to the fact that it had received the second lowest of four possible assessments in an audit of the Ministry of Education and Society in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that the management from him himself had failed to take Mr. Lord down without making sure that the staff were aware of the obligation to report violations of child safety rules.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexually harassing 12 boys during his two years at the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr Hare rejected claims that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting Mr Lord's breach of child safety.
Staff members gave evidence that they had witnessed such violations, including that Lord was alone with the children, privately watching over them, letting them sit on his lap, telling them he loved them, and letting them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was a subordinate to the Lord and asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, head of child services at the YMCA in Caringbah, which was Lord's superior, was "very intimidating and often difficult to talk to him about".
The CEO said he did not accept evidence from the staff that they felt unwell if they were to contact their superiors and report their actions.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord had clouded their judgment, and so they did not report the problem.
Mr Hare said he had told the board of the YMCA in New South Wales that the lesson of the “Jonathan Lord case” for the organization was that the staff “did not report” and the board agreed.
Mr Hare said the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations surfaced was made by YMCA’s general manager of child services, Liam Whitley.
He said the aim was to avoid tampering with the evidence, but it was “excessively zealous” and poorly executed.
Professor Stephen Smallbone, an expert on child sexual abuse at Griffith University, told the commission that the New South Wales YMCA was not a child-safe organization between 2009 and 2011.
He said there had been serious problems in recruitment, vetting, incorporation, training and staff management.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return as prime minister, but admitted that a return was unlikely.
In a nightly interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since his resignation in June 2007, Mr Blair has mostly shunned talks on British politics and confined his comments to foreign affairs and his role as envoy of the Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of prime minister, his answer was quoted by the London newspaper Evening Standard as saying: “Yes, of course, but it will probably be difficult, so...”
While crowds of horse show experts were gathering in Cardiff to compete for the Horse of the Year award, it was clear to everyone that the competition was not going to be easy.
But no one was prepared for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he doesn't go to school yet and only took his first steps a few months ago, this little boy and his pet animal, the Shetland pony Toffee, smoothly swung three laps to finally win the grand prize and leave behind 30 trailing adult rivals.
At the annual competition run by the Sunnybank equestrian centre in the village of Rudry near Cardiff, the inseparable pair – with the same height – were praised for their appearance, behaviour and style.
He stood up to the gentlemen and ladies in elegant hats, tucked his beret into a cheery corner, and let his two-year-old Toffee parade around the circuit.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural ability to control horses far beyond his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for insight and personality.
Fenton Toffee was given to him in March for his third birthday and since then he has been practicing daily with this Shetland pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee work well together.”
They didn’t have much hope, but eventually they left with a golden cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone thought he was phenomenal and strangers wanted to take pictures with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing off horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says, "There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone cheered and applauded."
He ran across the sand along the entire length of the arena, and although he looked so small, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors and a farm, and he has two chickens in charge.
“Given how he started, he will be back in the Horse of the Year competition soon and I’m sure he will do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: “The Fentons are only three, but they already know how to control a pony.”
They make a great team together.
The judges picked up Fenton and Toffee for their outstanding performance and for the way they performed on the circuit.
They always watch how good the team work is between the pony and the one who leads it – and Fenton and Toffee were the best on the oval.
I'm sure Fenton was also helped by the cute clothes, he really fit in there with him.
Inquisitive Newspapers to be Investigated
A Chinese newspaper that asked for the release of a reporter accused of defamation on the front page will be thoroughly investigated, the administrator told the press.
The Guangzhou-based New Express newspaper has made a rare public request for Chen Yongzhou’s release.
Mr Chen later admitted on television that he took bribes to make up stories about a company partly owned by the state.
The administrator said that the New Express newspaper will now make a “full correction”.
The order to “correct” came from the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in the province of Kuangtung.
The preliminary investigation revealed that between September 2012 and August 2013, New Express of the Yangcheng group Evening News published several false reports about Zoomlion.
"The editorial board of the New Express newspaper was disorderly," the administrator said in a statement.
He said he had decided to "imposed an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of the revocation of a journalist's license".
He also “ordered the Yangcheng group Evening News to carry out an overall correction of the New Express newspaper, and recommended that they investigate the relevant responsible persons in the New Express and immediately change the leadership of the New Express newspaper.”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express concerning financial irregularities in a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper issued two front-page requests for his release, claiming he was behind his journalistic work.
Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and admitted to giving false stories for bribes.
“In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion and the entire media industry and its ability to win the public’s trust,” he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I craved money and fame.
I realize that I acted wrongly.
After apologizing to Mr. Chen, the New Express published an apology on the front page in which it stated that it had failed when it had not carried out sufficient checks on his messages.
Recently, several closely watched suspects have made a confession on television.
Experts say the confessions are still regularly enforced, regardless of this year’s amendment to the law, which bans authorities from forcing anyone to accuse themselves.
Drug-smuggling tunnel found between the US and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico has been discovered, complete with its own lighting, ventilation and electric railways.
U.S. authorities have described a tunnel measuring about one meter by one meter as one of the most sophisticated secret corridors they have ever discovered.
The tunnel, which spans nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
The area is full of indefinite warehouses where trucks can be easily hidden before they are loaded with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel was closed before drugs could be smuggled into it undetected.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, authorities also detained eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
The three men, who according to the authorities worked as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
In the case of a conviction, he faces sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers infiltrate large drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest tunnel discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which poses a problem for drug cartels to get their product to consumers as quickly as possible.
In 2010, authorities found a corridor about 650 meters long equipped with rails that led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economics and the Center connect management.
For example, they will offer joint advertising.
New integrated newsroom of Economia in Karl<0xC3><0xAD>n, Prague.
Economia has taken the next step in transforming Centrum into its media house.
Since Friday, Economia and Centrum have a common top management.
"The unification of the organizational structure and the personnel union are essential for the integration of both publishing houses into a common media house," comments Kamil <0xC4><0x8C>ermák, Vice-Chairman of the Board of the Economy and Acting Director General.
The <0xC4><0x8C>ermák, who will be the head of the unified management, will be complemented by Andreas Demuth, Executive Director of the Centre Holdings.
Pavel Vopa<0xC5><0x99>il was appointed the new joint director of the business, to whom the advertising director of both companies, Zuzana Tyl<0xC4><0x8D>erová, is also subordinate.
<0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pán Burda became the new head of information technology.
Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Piská<0xC4><0x8D>ek is the co-director of the editorial offices and Jakub Unger is the transformation director.
Adéla Pittsová was appointed to the newly established position of Marketing Director.
V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Lhotská is now managing a separate corporate communications unit.
The joint CFO is Karel <0xC5><0xBD>alud, the human resources manager for both publishing houses is Petra Slabá.
"The new organizational structure will allow us, among other things, to enter the market with a joint offer of advertising products, to better link the content creation of all published titles and, last but not least, to significantly streamline the company's business management," Cermák added.
Economy, owned by financier Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, entered into an agreement to buy Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April this year.
The Centrum Holdings portfolio consists of servers Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, <0xC5><0xBD>ena.cz, web portals, an extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najisto or a portfolio of almost two dozen other smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny, the news server IHNED.cz, the weekly Respekt and Ekonom and a number of printed and online B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, it has long been the most successful in selling digital versions of its major titles.
This June, the publishing house moved to the newly built modern premises in Karl<0xC3><0xAD>n, Prague.
CME will target the TV business.
Almost a quarter of the people will be laid off.
The CME media group will be laying off.
By the end of the year he wants to lose a thousand people.
He wants to cut through all the secondary activities and focus only on his main business, television broadcasting.
The group, which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of approximately 4,500 people.
Nearly a quarter of people will lose their jobs.
The media group operates television stations in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
Part of CME is the company CET 21, which holds licenses for broadcasting television stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov, Telka and the Czech version of the music channel MTV.
How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for the domestic TV number one TV Nova, it is not yet clear.
"It's premature and we really can't comment on it," Nova's communications director Josef Koukol<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek said.
According to MF DNES, a significant layoff of the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but by far the biggest impact should be on the personnel status of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Nova’s two new CEOs, Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who took over from long-time CEO Adrian Sarbu, said during a conference call with analysts on Wednesday that they want to limit all activities that are not directly related to the television business.
Therefore, it is quite likely that they will significantly reduce, in particular, the cost of producing their own programmes, filmmaking and production activities.
In the industrial complex of <0xC4><0x8C>KD in Prague, a cooling tower burned down at night
In the <0xC4><0x8C>KD industrial complex in Prague, a large-capacity magazine was burning, according to firefighters, apparently a cooling tower.
"Firefighters left for the fire on Thursday before eleven o'clock in the evening, this morning they were still putting out the fire," said Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na Adamcová, a spokeswoman for Prague firefighters.
The amount of pollutants in the air in the vicinity according to measurements did not exceed the allowed limits.
The extent of the damage and the cause of the fire are still unknown.
About fifty firefighters arrived at the area in Kolbenova Street.
"This is a fire in a large-capacity storage tank, probably a cooling tower," Adamc said.
"There is no functioning hydrant network in the area, so we are extinguishing it with the help of transport lines from the tankers," she added.
According to the server tn.cz complicated extinguishing poorly functioning network of hydrants, so firefighters had to deliver water from elsewhere.
The fire department has issued a second level of fire alarm.
There are four stages in total, in the most serious situations, a fourth is declared.
Chemists also set out to check the level of hazardous substances that could have been released into the air in the event of a fire.
"However, they did not detect any amount of pollutants in the air that exceeded hygiene standards," a spokeswoman for the fire department said.
British Police Delivered Extradition Notice to Assange
British police have delivered a notice of extradition to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he has applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had given the 40-year-old Australian an "extradition notice" asking him to show up at a police station and that if he did not, he could face arrest.
Assange had exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court overturned his appeal against extradition this month, facing extradition to Sweden on sex crimes charges.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the U.S., he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, where he applied for asylum.
“Scotland Yard has delivered an extradition notice to a 40-year-old man asking him to arrive at the police station on the day and hour he was assigned,” a spokesman said.
Assange continues to violate bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on the notification.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he could face espionage charges after posting 250,000 U.S. diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
The driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
He was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was spotted in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found that he had a cup with a drink between his thighs.
In Colchester police court, Howie pleaded guilty to driving recklessly and inattentively.
Seven points were added to his account, which resulted in a six-month ban on the proceedings.
Howie was also ordered to pay the costs of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and a surcharge of <0xC2><0xA3>100 for the defendant.
As a result of the tax on foreign property owners, the London bubble bursts
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally quantified the income tax on financial assets, but is awaiting the final decision of Mr Osborn, who in the 2012 budget presented a 7% fee for the transfer of real estate for buildings worth over <0xC2><0xA3>2 million and annual fees for buyers who own real estate within the company, rather than as individuals.
Revenue from the transfer fee for residential property in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea districts, which amounted to <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, the North West and Yorkshire and the Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: “Given the increase in the transfer of high-value homes and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high-value property is under-taxed regardless of the effect of the outdated head tax system.”
He added that “this move may have caused some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy property in London, or to be reluctant to sell existing owners.”
Leading real estate – the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price – in the rich strip that stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon saw a record 11.8% increase last year.
Prices in central London continue to show steady growth of 5.6% year-on-year, but were overshadowed by a booming “home market” in which, according to a survey by Savills, the south-west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) saw gains.
Scientists have shed more light on how the movements of the tail are related to the mood of the dog
Previous research has shown that happy dogs wriggle their tails more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs wriggle their tails mostly to the left.
Now, however, scientists say other dogs can spot and respond to these subtle differences in tail movement.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trento, said: “It is well known in humans that the left and right sides of the brain have different connections to stimuli that evoke positive or negative emotions.”
We have tried to do the same in other species.
He added that, as in humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to gain more information about how dogs respond to other dogs’ disproportional tail twitching, the researchers monitored animals that watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't be long before we understand why their tail goes sometimes to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown dogs films about dogs – either in a natural version or in the form of a silhouette – in order to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we have also been able to adjust the movement of the tail and depict it more to the right or left.”
When the animals saw the otherwise indistinct dog moving its tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog wagging its tail), it remained perfectly calm.
But when she noticed the tail shooting mostly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog wagging its tail), their heart rate increased and the animals seemed insecure.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think dogs would consciously communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs have learned from experience what movements they must and may not pay attention to.
He said: “If you meet dogs several times and their tail movement in one direction is repeatedly associated with rather friendly behavior and the movement to the right produces less friendly behavior, you will react based on this experience.”
The researchers say the findings can help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers better understand the emotions of their animals.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior at the University of Bristol, said it was not the first study to examine whether the left and right sides of a dog were important.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they observe an aggressive dog, and to the right when they look at a cheerful dog.
And in another scholarly treatise from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “Dog robots were more likely to be introduced to dogs when they were wagging their tails to the left than to the right, when they were more likely to become insecure — quite the opposite of the Italian study.”
The difference, he said, may be due to the fact that dogs in these different studies did not interpret animals in films or dog robots entirely as dogs.
He explained that a study on how dogs respond to real dogs could help.
“Although there is strong evidence for many different mammals that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won’t be long before we understand why their tail goes sometimes to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
Rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed a concert in Glasgow after the lead singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield group was scheduled to perform at the city's Hydro complex on Friday.

Pope Francis Appoints First Cardinals in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals for the first time on Feb. 22.
Cardinals hold the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church right after the Pope and are the ones who elect the Pope, so Francis will establish his first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor.
There are now 201 cardinals.
But once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope – the group is reduced to 120 electing cardinals.
In a statement announcing the report, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a gathering of current cardinals known as the Consistory would be held before the new cardinals were officially promoted.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance to facilitate the planning of other assemblies that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electors is likely to fall by February.
He said the pope usually appoints as many cardinals as needed to bring the number of voters back up to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
The consistory next year will be significant because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a certain orientation towards Europe, Europe and, above all, Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first election of cardinals since Francis established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything for himself.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was “quite possible” that these cardinals would be asked for advice by the pope.
We haven’t been in this situation before – it’s completely new.
Valero said the popes have traditionally promoted bishops from high places to cardinals, but Francis is “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he appoints.”
GM is recalling some new light trucks in the U.S. to repair seat backs
According to Friday’s announcement from the U.S. auto safety authority, General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light trucks to repair a manual tilting backrest defect.
For some of these vehicles, the tilt mechanism of the front seats may have a fault.
As a result, seat backs do not comply with federal automotive safety standards for head restraints.
A notice posted on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) says that “if a car gets hit from behind, the head restraint may not protect passengers properly, which increases the risk of injury.”
The downloaded models were produced between August 1 and September 10.
GM launched the delivery in June, and it is the most important vehicle launch for the leading American automaker since its restructuring after bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owner of the delivery of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the notice to owners due to the government’s 16-day dysfunction, which weakened car sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra deliveries, which were redesigned for 2014 models, rose to about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado models and 16,503 Sierra models from its deliveries.
Shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
The Desperate Cry of Obama's Voters
I voted for Obama twice – I shared the hope of a possible change
He says Obama's sincere efforts have thwarted the Republican Party's obstruction
Obstructive policies can’t excuse the woes of Obama’s health care website or drone attacks
Obama’s 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year medical student at Harvard.
I am reading a very sad book these days.
About this book I thought that during the gloomy days of my sophomore year at the medical school, it would encourage me and restore a bit of hope in me.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win” and it’s a reminiscence of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patient reviews and go to bed tonight, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches took your breath away.
The election ended in overwhelming preponderance, and television news forced us to reflect on the historical value of this moment.
My classmates wept with joy, and my parents hid the newspapers they had gathered.
A young team of visionaries headed for the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had 82 percent support.
And I'm closing the book here.
Going into the present is a harsh awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic days – they seem distant memories, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I threw in my first ballot, there have indeed been changes.
It was definitely not what I had imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied successes – from the Affordable Care Act to the removal of our troops from Iraq to the end of the “don’t ask, don’t say anything” policy after the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I am convinced that party obstructions have reversed so many efforts to move our nation forward: among other things, immigration reform, the public’s ability to choose health care, and the closure of a base in Guantanamo.
But after many situations where I defended the Obama administration in front of colleagues and friends, when it comes to the explanations they can provide, I have reached an absolute limit.
I found myself in a place of political hopelessness.
The obstruction of the Republicans cannot explain the agreement to eavesdrop on foreign leaders or drone strikes that kill innocent children overseas.
They cannot explain the fact that the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans, nor the fact that it persecutes those who expose the government’s misconduct.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without due process of law, or for limiting public contributions and spending during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... of the Nixon administration.”
And most recently, they cannot even excuse the inability to create a simple website more than 3 years after signing the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if something like this could be expected.
Should I have known at the age of 18 that government power might be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it?
The elected office clearly has no predictable course, and our public conversations will be shaped by the opposition political party and random events such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I have given above appear to be largely the result of the administration’s own decision.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unbridled alternative, and he seemed unable to solidify his policy or position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, freed from the pressure of the next election, would fill the hopes we had once heard of.
Yet going back to 2008 – with Obama’s support falling below 45% this week – is becoming increasingly difficult through this book.
It forces me to remember the many promises that have been lost.
This week, I read a chapter in a book about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat with Clinton in the primaries in Pennsylvania.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that they needed to get back to the pace and stay true to their mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you.
The thoughts expressed in this comment are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer Claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott Is in Conflict of Interest Over Parental Leave Program
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict over a parental leave program because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining tycoon, who is in dispute over the payment of a $6 million tax on coal, made the claim as he tried to sweep the question of whether he was in a conflict of interest off the table.
Palmer’s United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which play a crucial role in deciding whether to levy taxes on coal and mining activities.
But Mr Palmer argued that only ministers could be in conflict of interest, adding that Abbott’s daughters were in a position to benefit personally from the policy.
“He got into a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if either of his daughters got pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether she would get parental leave,” Mr. Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner in the race for the seat for the Sunshine Coast Fairfax constituency, with 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the election results in order to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the closing of the polling stations?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, tap the details on the computer, vote immediately and get the results at 7:30 p.m.?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
The point is that results can be rubberized if no one likes them?
These days and at this time, the use of pencils seems incredible.
The Electoral Commission studied the possibilities of electronic voting and recently issued a joint contribution to the discussion with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his political agenda extended to airports in the Sunshine Coast region and that he would take his new job "very seriously".
A public office is a service to the public.
“We are not seeking any reward other than that we can serve society at this critical time,” he said.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have discovered that washing your hands will change your mood.
The experiment was attended by 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two were to solve an insoluble problem.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group that failed to wash their hands seemed much more optimistic than the one where the participants did not wash their hands.
Also, the group "with washed hands" performed better in the next test than the other.
Still, those who washed their hands performed worse in other tests than those who didn’t.
The results of the "washed" were at the level of the third group, the participants of which did not notice any previous failure.
The results of the test show, according to psychologists, that physical cleanliness removes really negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, motivation decreases, the testers have to concentrate much more in the next tests.
If we were to transfer the results of the research to the Czech Republic, we would probably be the most optimistic after returning from the toilet.
After using the toilet, only one percent of Czechs and Czechs do not wash their hands, but on the way by public transport it is already a fifth.
They also tend to stick to hygiene after work in the garden or in the workshop, where 85% of people wash their hands.
Stroking a pet motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, how much it is necessary to wash your hands after shaking hands with a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8% of Czechs and 40.3% of Slovaks wash their hands.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be appropriate, I'm afraid the reality is different and people are trying to do a little bit better," said Klaudia Komárková, a skin doctor.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
According to two people familiar with the situation, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is suspending two traders in its foreign exchange division, another indication that a global investigation by regulators into suspected currency market manipulation is becoming more frequent.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with competent authorities to investigate the world’s largest financial market, where they are changing owners of $5.3 trillion every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of an expanding investigation in response to the LIBOR (London Interbank Rate) manipulation scandal.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it had received a request for information from authorities this month.
“Our ongoing investigation into this matter continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other authorities,” the bank said in a statement.
Last month, people close to the event said RBS had handed over records of emails and instant messages sent from and to the former trader’s accounts to the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is believed to have been relieved of his current position as European chairman of foreign exchange trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European chairman of Citi cash trading, took his leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, former head of currency trading at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
Neither of these traders was charged with any wrongdoing.
Mr. Usher's IM group included the bankers of Barclays and Citigroup, the insiders to the event said.
UBS said this week that after the Swiss supervisory authority Finma announced it was investigating suspicious foreign exchange market machinations at several Swiss banks, it had taken action against some of its employees.
Globally, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss antitrust authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are investigating claims that these bankers have conspired to move the currency market.
People familiar with the situation said HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from the relevant authorities.
Banks are scouring years-old instant messages and e-mails to find cases of wrongdoing.
Reports of investigations have alarmed traders in an area that has been one of the biggest drivers of profit making in investment bank closings in recent years, but which has been disrupted by the small volatility of currencies limiting opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the gravity of the situation by arguing that a large and highly liquid foreign exchange market is essentially impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders say that may not necessarily be the case.
A high-ranking trader said that despite the significant volume of daily foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms means that “you can start to influence the market at relatively low prices.”
The report came on the same day Credit Suisse announced it had fired a trader from its stock trading division this week who caused a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately alerted the competent authorities and cooperated with their supervisory authorities.
“We are convinced that this merchant acted alone and that this issue has been resolved,” Credit Suisse said in a statement.
The number of HIV-infected in Prague has exceeded a thousand
Doctors in Prague have already registered more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the start of monitoring in 1986 until the end of this third quarter, tests confirmed the infection in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This is according to statistics from the National AIDS Reference Laboratory of the National Institutes of Health.
According to her, there have been 2,063 infected in the Czech Republic so far.
In 396, the disease of immune failure has already broken out.
198 people have died.
The number of infected people in the Czech Republic has been increasing every year in the last decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were already 121.
In 2009, 156 new infections were detected, and in 2010, 180.
Last year the number fell to 153, but last year it was a record.
According to the lab, there were 212.
"There is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," said Miroslav Hlavat<0xC3><0xBD>, an expert on AIDS, who led Prague's House of Light for Patients for years.
From October to the end of 2011, tests revealed the disease in 39 people and last year in 47, Hlavat<0xC3><0xBD> said.
In September, doctors registered 21 new patients and three patients.
From the start of the follow-up until the end of September, 1,710 men and 353 women were tested for HIV.
The AIDS outbreak affected 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
If you really want to get to know a city, you should go to a cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a walk through the crowded center with monuments, churches and galleries, more than a bedeck would reveal.
Many people "read from the graves".
Cemeteries are slowly wandering around and gaining an intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out what kind of people live here, what nationalities, what beliefs, how large and cohesive families they belong to, at what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social status, what their taste is.
And from the state of the graves, they will find out how the dead are cared for by the survivors.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care law
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the health care law signed by Barack Obama is in line with the Constitution, a crucial victory for the Obama administration.
With a 5:4 vote, the court ruled that the individual regulation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which mandates citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014 or face a fine – does not contradict the constitution on the basis of government tax jurisdiction.
Court President John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The court also upheld the remaining parts of the 2,700-page law and ruled that the statutory health care requirement, which mandates states to extend the possibility of obtaining sickness insurance, otherwise there is a risk of losing all federal funding of sickness insurance, is not coercive and contrary to the constitution.
26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises have filed a lawsuit to block this law.
During the 2012 primaries, the law vehemently rejected every major Republican candidate, including proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
"Mugabe is a limping donkey" no longer faces jail, court overturns law
Until now, Zimbabweans have had to pay close attention to how they talk in public about the 89-year-old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s, and has been its leader since the end of 1987.
Under Section 33 of the Criminal Code, a fine of $100 to one year in prison could be imposed for contempt of office.
“State attorneys should not zealously accuse people who comment on the president in pubs or other public places,” the court said in a statement.
The nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government will appeal against the court’s decision, the BBC reported.
A number of injured Zimbabweans, including Tendai Danga, who was arrested by police two years ago for allegedly insulting the president while arguing with a police officer at a bar, were vocally opposed to the law.
In May, an opposition activist who had publicly lashed out at Mugabe as a “squiggly donkey” ended up in prison.
In August, prosecutors charged a 26-year-old man with using a poster with Robert Mugabe’s face as toilet paper.
The court also ruled that it was unconstitutional to restrict media freedom.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements later turn out to be untrue," said Deputy Justice Minister Luke Malal.
Until now, Zimbabwean law allowed a person who published false information to be sentenced to 20 years in prison.
“The existence of a law allowing someone to be criminalized for making a false statement has a chilling effect on the right to freedom of expression,” Malala said.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has ruled the country with a hard hand for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with broader civil liberties in a referendum in March.
Little steps away from the one-man dictatorship of the country came in 2009, when an agreement between Mugabe and the opposition elevated Morgan Tsvangirai to the premiership.
However, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and until 2008 the highest inflation in the world, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
In 2009, the government abolished the national currency.
Today in Zimbabwe, only the currencies of other countries are used.
The impoverished economy goes to the back of Mugabe's reckless agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land to white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience with running farms.
Central banks will maintain swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument that will allow banks to access global currencies whenever they need them.
The banks said in a joint statement.
"It's a very sensible step," Julian Callow, chief international economist at Barclays, said in a statement.
"So far, all transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so this is not a surprise in my opinion," adds Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Benda, chief economist at BH Securities.
Central bankers are strengthening the bonds that began to emerge in 2007, when the international credit market first stalled.
Central bank agreements allowed access to euros, dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The central bankers’ decision comes at a time when the US Fed is preparing to end its program to support the US economy, which could drive the price of money in the global market even higher.
By default, a swap contract is used to overcome the liquidity shortage of one currency while the liquidity surplus of the other currency.
It can be understood as a deposit of one currency and a loan of another currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore confidence in European banks.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, with the ECB overseeing 150 banks.
How Tipsport (not) erases personal data.
More than a year ago, I made a registration on Tipsport.cz.
However, I did not finish it, because someone was sitting at the branch office who could not complete the registration from the Internet.
And because I did not want to go to another branch, the registration failed, then I moved and thanks to that my address and ID number changed.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that it could not be done because I have a different OP number, address and that it simply could not be completed and that I had to ask for deletion of data and make a new registration.
This is what I did and on 24.10.2013 I wrote to the technical support that I request the deletion of all my personal data from the database in accordance with the applicable law on personal data protection.
On that day, technical support wrote to me that I had to complete the registration at the branch.
This started a marathon of emails for technical support, where finally after the 4th of October they wrote that they deleted personal data at my request.
So one would think that he could make that new registration and here started again problems first it wrote me that my username is already occupied (I understand it was not deleted - it's not personal data, but in the end they eliminated this too).
So I used a different username and it jumped out at me that my personal data was already stored to complete the registration at the branch (how can they have stored something they claim to have deleted?), so I contacted technical support again.
When I asked how it was possible, they replied that they had deleted the personal data on 25.10. and that I should send an email with the error.
This I did (yesterday around 3 p.m.) and today I received a reply that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that is why it is not possible, because I used the same name and date of birth.
I have been in contact with technical support for a week and I am still not able to contact them.
And what about the fact that if it were true what it claims (as it is not) no one with the same name or the same date of birth would be able to register if this is already registered.
By the way, in that 13.22 I actually registered, on the same name and date of birth, but I used a fictional email and phone number and the world marveled, I got a page that sent me an email link to complete the registration.
But how is it possible if you can not register on the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport ties the registration to an e-mail and a phone number and the data just didn’t shut down as he claims.
So again I told this to the tech support that they are just lying (either intentionally or they don’t know what they are writing), because what they are writing is not true.
I have shown several screens that the problem with the registration was already before 31.10. so the "fake" registration simply does not affect this.
Tipsport wrote me a harsh sentence - I'm sorry, but by the fact that you are already re-registered, we can not verify your claim.
And he's out of communication.
Accordingly, it repeats the same sentence over and over again that the registration is linked to the name and date of birth.
They can’t even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on that link in the email and so it didn’t actually take place.
If I sum it up, Tipsport not only did not erase the data as it claims, but it also lies when it claims the opposite.
What’s even worse is that you can easily prove how they lie and try to make it look like the mistake is on the customer’s side.
By the way, after posting this issue on my personal blog, things got a little wobbly and from Technical Support came an email that they are passing the matter for review and I will be informed (after a week of urgency and guessing and warning of the same error).
In the subway on the Bridge plays music
Prague’s Transport Company (DPP) has launched the Music in the Metro project.
The first vestibule, where reproduced instrumental music is played continuously during the operation of the metro, is the Bridge of Line A at the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The test operation will last six months.
Michal Horá<0xC4><0x8D>ek presented his new double album, band and three singers
Texturist Michal Horá<0xC4><0x8D>ek brought to the hall of the Cologne Town Hall not only his brand new two-CD Czech Calendar, but especially in the show Between Us, the singers Lenka Nova, Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Segrad and Ondra Ruml accompanied by the excellent Orchestra of Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Benek.
After the opening intro and the acting etude about the late musician, Michal Horá<0xC4><0x8D>ek gradually invited all three singers to the stage, he himself came with a candle in his hand and reminded the story of the last time they played in Cologne and the theater and the whole city lost electricity.
"Otherwise, two kinds of cards were produced in Cologne, with which I had a lot of contact," he recalled.
He also reminded the native of President Zeman.
"Maybe we could do a tour of Zakolany or D<0xC3><0xBA>bravce near Bratislava," he joked about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, who had not left the stage and had not spoken, sat at a table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical act.
The calendar was made by Josef Mánes, who put it on the astronomical clock, about ice hockey, but at that time he had no idea that we were meeting in those squares and chanting, who does not jump, is not Czech.
That’s the name of a song from the Czech calendar, but we’re not going to play here today,” he said.
Ondra Ruml, however, from this album sang for him a very suitable Sleep by day, sing at night and accompanied her on the guitar.
Otherwise, if he did not sing, he played percussion, all three singers were accompanied by a band consisting of keyboards, cello, guitar and double bass.
All three vocalists sang together a little odrhová<0xC4><0x8D>ka Do strán<0xC4><0x9B> <0xC5><0xA1>edá, which immediately stirred up the auditorium.
"I am glad that you were interested in this song, which did not surprise me in Kmoch's town," Michal Horá<0xC4><0x8D>ek responded afterwards.
After the memory of Peter Hapka, I recognize the performance of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Segrad, in the original by Richard M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, rewarded with huge applause, Hana Hegerová reminded the song Dad liked L<0xC3><0xAD>da Baarová with Horá<0xC4><0x8D>ek's explanation of the communist ban and the replacement of Baar by Maarek's American version.
The composer Michael Kocáb was reminded of the composition Sebastián, and Segrado then sang a beautiful piece of Prague performed by Jarda Svoboda, a Zásmuk native and former Kol<0xC3><0xAD>nák.
That was the conclusion, a standing ovation and an addition in the form of an optimistic composition We live in a wonderful time.
Another addition to the playlist was prepared, but the fans did not applaud.
Almost immediately after the concert, the four of them sat down at the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horá<0xC4><0x8D>ek’s books and even the cover of the legendary LP, and took pictures with any interested people.
Berdycha with <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánek will be complemented by Rosol and Hájek
At the Davis Cup final against Serbia, the non-playing captain of Czech tennis players Jaroslav Navrátil nominated four Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Berdych, Radek <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánek, Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Rosol, Jan Hájek.
Czech representatives defend the trophies, but they are going to play on the pitch of the opponent in the Belgrade arena, where the match will take place on the hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The Czechs are in the finals for the third time in five years.
“We know we’re going to hot ground, it’s going to be wild, and we need to focus on our performances as always.”
"We will go there with only one goal - to get three points and sell the best," said <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánek, the builder of the winning point in last year's final with Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama on how to bomb Syria.
U.S. troops in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis have shown exactly what the bombing of Syria should look like.
Without unnecessary noise, threats and millions of statements, they sent planes, which hit the target and returned.
Without being lulled by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole action and no longer comment on it.
The exact opposite of the confused and bigoted, unsupportive actions of Obama’s Syrian policy.
And the most satisfying thing about the whole attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Don’t be fooled by the media’s claims that a “Syrian base” or “supply for Hezbollah” was bombed.
I recently wrote here that while US aid to secular rebels in the country remains only on a rhetorical level, Russia cheerfully continues to supply weapons to Syria.
And it was the fresh supply of Russian missiles unloaded in the port of Latakia that became the target of an Israeli airstrike.
That's a clear message.
And notice, Israel has again bombed the Assad regime, not the rebels, even though popular Internet theories say the opposite should be true.
The U.S. government has awarded two members of the special forces, probably the Delta Force.
It was not known until now that they had distinguished themselves during the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi.
The heroic death of two former members of the SEALs who defended the CIA premises in the city is known, in my opinion, they were members of the secret CIA commando, which is made up of former soldiers.
It has long been speculated what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even at the CIA’s elsewhere located residence.
It's clearer now.
In any case, the information that the CIA has its offices in Libya protected by machine-gun nests (on one of which both members of the SEALs died after a mortar strike) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about the two previously unknown heroes.
They were part of the American commando in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the news of the attack in Benghazi, they volunteered to intervene and, together with five private contractors, shot their way into the CIA compound in Benghazi.
The Obama administration is baffled by the fact that during that attack the commando was not deployed officially and in its entirety, and that it was simply hesitating about what to do.
Commander Commando, without orders, is likely to release these volunteers.
In any case, the fact that the country operates not one-time, but permanently American commandos, CIA agents and private contractors is quite interesting information.
And this is due to the fact that until recently, nothing of this kind was officially admitted, and even now there is only talk of some kind of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it is good that the US is half-heartedly trying to fight terrorism in Libya.
Although it would require much more help to resolve the national situation.
The last place of secret and permanent conflict, which I want to write about today, is the coast of Iran.
It was not so long ago that the media almost praised the Iranian air force for prosecuting American drones.
However, little is known about how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to discover your drone in the air, there is nothing you can do about it.
However, if Iranian drones are discovered in international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom pursued the American drone in international space over the sea, when there was perhaps the first sharp deployment of the American F-22 Raptor super fighter in history.
He flew the Phantom over to visually verify its armament without the Phantom registering it on radar or simply noticing it, and then, when he suddenly appeared at his side and urged the Iranian pilot to return home, he obeyed without murmuring.
Not surprisingly, the Phantom is an American-made aircraft that remembers the Vietnam War.
He's no match for Raptor.
We want to show that Pilsen still knows how to win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has been mostly unsuccessful lately, defender or midfielder Viktoria Plze<0xC5><0x88> Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Rajtoral has a form that brought him back to the national team after a year.
He also succeeds in shooting, boasts of activity, after the procedure he was ordered a penalty kick in the match in Teplice.
Viktoria reached for victory in the last two rounds against Slavia and in Teplice, but in the end she took only one point from these two duels.
Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Rajtoral believes that his team in the match with Jablonec will break the unpleasant series.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe we will beat Jablonec at home," promises Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Rajtoral.
The team is carefully preparing for a difficult match with the North Bohemians, who play offensive football.
Everything is directed to the match with Jablonec, the coach prepares us well, as always we draw a lot from the video analysis of the opponent’s game.
"I believe it will be an excellent match on Friday night," the Czech national team representative invites fans to the stands of Doosan Arena.
Plze<0xC5><0x88>'s last matches did not go as well as she would like, but the word crisis defender Victoria rejects.
That’s the way it goes in football, sometimes you’re in good shape and sometimes you’re in worse shape.
I am not talking about the crisis at all.
"I believe we will win on Friday and it will be good again," said the Westman defender.
Victoria's team will once again rely on the support of fans.
“It’s Friday night and I’d like to invite our fans who are great to play.”
"I believe we will repay them with a victory," Rajtoral adds.
Jana P<0xC4><0x9B>tová: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's actually not a step at all, but a big leap - a jump a few years back, into memories, into my childhood.
It’s a reminder of what it was like to have no worries and just come home from school and wash the dishes, relax and do your homework.
Although these "obligations", it was mostly just a theory, the wishes of parents.
The practice was completely different - to run from school, throw the bag in the corner and run out.
Play with other children ball games, jumping shots.
Then, during the series, Helena and her boys embroider a festive tablecloth for grandmother's birthday with a chain stitch.
And then, after several warnings, finally wash the dishes, relax, in the winter, apply wood to tile stoves and do tasks until dark under a lamp (or rely on a classmate and instead of tasks to write love poems addressed to school love).
In the morning, eat homemade strawberry jam (from real fruit, not those jams that are sold now, the content of which next to strawberries did not even lie) and drink it with tea from dried herbs that my mother and I liked to collect.
I also remember those magical evenings when there was a grave silence in the room, when my sister and I were recording songs from the radio on cassettes, which were rolling loudly in the old cassette player after my mother.
And then we flipped those tapes on a pencil and played the same song over and over again, our favorite, and toasted it with a siphon.
Or we telephoned across the table with the help of cans, which were tied together with a string - and while we were on the phone to hear each other better, it was necessary to thoroughly clean our ears, then the eardrum was a match + cotton wool.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live on it in such a way that we lacked nothing.
We didn’t need any iPhones, iPads, or even mobile phones or laptops or branded clothing.
Clothes were inherited from generation to generation, and the best "addition" to the wardrobe was a batik T-shirt of domestic production with the help of SAVA.
From the electronics, we were satisfied with the aforementioned mom’s cassette player and the Walkman, which we shared with my sister and which we used anyway only on the train on the school trip.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Hat Hop or Man, don't be angry, or as I said, go "only" out.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, my parents certainly saved on it for a long time, but unfortunately it did not warm up in our country for a long time.
My little sister put a strudel in it, said it was so beautiful that he used the tapes, so she tried to see if the strudel slept.
Unfortunately, he slept, but it was his last bite.
Well, that's still the case today, poor thing, on my dad's plate all the time.
She says that when Lenka was little, she put a strudel in the video and thought that she would play the recipe and not play it, so she still can’t bake it.
I remember how we were all able to communicate, to communicate without a phone, without a computer.
Together with my sister, we agreed to meet our neighbor’s granddaughter during the holidays at her grandmother’s house, when we will meet again next summer at her grandmother’s house – and so it was, so it was true.
We've met.
Do you promise to see someone in a year?
I also remember the winter when we ran outside with the whole village, building snowmen, riding on a snowy hill by the church on bags stuffed with hay.
Then we had dinner together with the whole family and talked about the past day.
Of course, my sister and I used to hear the notorious phrase before every dinner: "Go wash your hands!"
Yes, this is still true today, but you certainly do not have soap tied to the tap in the lemon mesh in the bathroom.
After dinner, when my dad was in the garage "working" on beer with Jarda from the village, my mom and I lay down on the floor, leaned our feet on the tiled stove, opened the door and stared at the flame and listened to the crackling of the wood that poured from the stove.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated with each other - we talked - we did not write daily messages through various chats, SMS messages.
There was no such thing, and yet we knew so much more about each other.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It’s nice to remember, especially if I complement these memories by looking at albums where black-and-white photos are neatly pasted with black corners.
And if I didn’t know how old I was then, the year of taking the picture is always written on the back of the photo.
I see that although the cuts according to the pot did not suit us very much, and moreover we had trousers after our cousin by two numbers bigger, no one had laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd rather go back to that one step forward - to reality.
Until 2013 and I will wait to see what the modern age will come up with for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories of mine are now for the young teenage generation at least somewhere "a hundred years behind the monkeys" and I think they miss a lot, that they will not experience this "forerunner" time either.
I wish they did!
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents from the now-defunct Nortel, filed a patent infringement lawsuit Thursday against mobile phone makers including Google, a company it auctioned off in Nortel's bankruptcy.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel’s patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies in the U.S. District Court in Texas for patent infringement.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been accused of violating seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps link Internet search terms to relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which is the core of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reachable.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that run on Google’s Android operating system, which competes strongly with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel’s patents.
Google increased its offering several times and eventually offered up to $4.4 billion.
After Nortel was defeated by Rockstar in the patent battle, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a trade motivated in part by Motorola’s patent group.
“Despite its failure to obtain the disputed patents at auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe those patents,” the lawsuit states.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages from Google because it alleges a patent infringement by Google intentionally, as the lawsuit alleges.
Miloslava Cejpková: November Smile
It came from the outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, which we are not yet used to.
At first, she put aside her smile, the one she kept showing off as a defense against her friendly surroundings.
This made her very relieved, because it was a mask that she decided not to put off in public.
He was honest at home only on the days when she was a grandmother and had her grandchildren Elinka or Ad<0xC3><0xAD>k around her.
And, of course, when her sons called.
She remembered very well the lesson of the endless courses of business skills.
Now they've finally come in handy.
Don't make your loved ones sad.
Then he flew into a corner.
Like a disguise on a masquerade.
November, or any other month, can't do that miracle to really smile, like when they were on a trip with someone who's been gone for almost three years.
Egypt appoints first freely elected president
Mohamed Morsi has taken the oath of office, but his triumphant day is unlikely to end the political turmoil in Egypt.
Islamist leader Mohammed Morsi promised a “new Egypt” when he was inaugurated as the country’s first freely elected president, after Husni Mubarak, who had been deposed 16 months earlier.
In his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He was sworn in before 18 judges dressed in black robes in a mansion built with a view of the Nile that resembles an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“The Egyptian people today have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old US-educated engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been the target of fierce attacks by governments for most of its 84-year history as an illegal organization.
When Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. in a small motorcade, hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to celebrate the president, and unlike Mubarak’s presidential ostentatiousness, transportation was only briefly halted so that the column could pass the usually busy road connecting the city center with the suburbs to the south.
Mursi’s personal prestige, mockingly referred to as the Muslim Brotherhood’s uncharismatic “reserve tire,” has grown sharply since his victory and his speech on Friday, which aimed to present him not only as a candidate for Islamists but also as anyone who wants to end the mutiny against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Morsi told judges in a red-tie suit in a wood-paneled chamber, where he was sworn in.
Morsi later traveled to Cairo University to deliver his inaugural address.
While he stood guard, he received an official welcome from the military band that played the national anthem.
The military commander of the field Marshal Husain Tantavi was present.
His arrival was accompanied by chants of “the army and the people are one hand” from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a centre of secular education and later became a bastion of Islamic student movements in the 1970s.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to once again seize presidential powers taken from his office by a military council that took them from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before a court rather than before parliament, as is customary, he has yielded to the will of the army, indicating that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi’s speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
In the ghettos there will probably be police specialists, they have to ease the tension
Police specialists should work in the ghettos in the Czech Republic in the future.
They'd spend up to half their errands here.
They would keep order and solve problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from poor places and residents from the surrounding area.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of the Interior counts on this.
According to him, "accelerated provision of social housing" would help to improve the situation in the country.
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were about 300 poor houses and quarters in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were 80,000 people living there, mostly Romani people.
Adults in the ghettos were out of work, families were dependent on benefits, children ended up in "special" schools.
It's a paltry usury.
According to experts, the problem sites have increased by a hundred.
Relations between their inhabitants and others are sharpening.
Anti-Romani marches took place in several places.
People from the surrounding area also joined the extremists.
According to the Interior Ministry, it is difficult for the police in areas with ghettos to maintain security and order.
A fundamental condition is, he says, "the consistent application of equal treatment in law enforcement".
However, this cannot be achieved without detailed knowledge of the place and people.
A specialist would go on walks in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half of his service, the rest would serve in his district.
He would keep order in the troubled area.
He would also know the locals, so he could better solve problems or offenses.
"Thanks to the trust that has been established, specialists will be more easily able to prevent a whole range of illegal acts," the Interior Ministry said.
Specialists in the ghettos would receive a surcharge of 500 to 1000 crowns per month.
The introduction of special police officers into problem areas is to be covered by Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (now about 15.5 million crowns).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the sum, funds 85 percent.
Preparations began this year, now a detailed proposal is being drafted.
The project is expected to last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by their neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied for several years in Slovakia, where the problem with socially excluded localities is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Romani settlements here," the report's authors said.
How many specialists there should be in the Czech Republic is not yet clear.
The answer is to give an analysis that will determine the places where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release each year after the end of the project.
According to the draft of the project, the selected police officers will first undergo an internship in Slovakia.
Five dozen members should undergo this training per year.
They will be the most suitable candidates.
There should also be special training for police officers who will work in the ghettos.
According to the authors, mainly social housing would help to improve the situation.
It should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the ideas of the interior, it would have three categories.
A minimum standard would be met by hostels with well-defined rules, such as the number of people per room.
The average standard would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard would be social housing, which would be comparable to ordinary housing.
Tenants would have to implement an integration plan that social workers would draw up with them.
They would have to follow the rules of accommodation, take care of their health, send children to schools, retrain and actively look for work.
If they were to seek inclusion, they would advance to a higher standard of living.
According to the interior, the system of transparent housing should work for at least 30 years, until the next generation grows up "in a pro-integrated environment".
The model of social housing is prepared by the departments for local development and work.
It is to be proposed by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: Uhl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> vrch - one of our youngest volcanoes.
Uhl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> vrch is a prominent hill 3 km southeast of Bruntál.
Along with several others, the evidence of volcanic activity in N<0xC3><0xAD>zk<0xC3><0xBD> Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k at the time (from a geological point of view) is recent.
The last eruptions were at the beginning of the quarter-hill.
Viewed from a greater distance, on top of Uhl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ského vrch (Uhl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ské Hill) there is a striking white plastered Baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of Help, built between 1755 and 1765.
It replaced the original wooden pilgrim chapel.
The inn next to the church did not survive.
Shortly after the completion of the church, an alley of four rows of lime trees, about 1 km long, was planted.
The cross road on Uhl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> vrch is the third version, the original one stood here after 1916, the second, from 2001 it lasted only until 2004.
At fifteen stops there are wooden sculptures made by local art woodcarver Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Nedomlel.
He used various species of trees from the area of Low Autumn.
Similarly, the pedestals made of rocks from the local area form an interesting geological exposition.
At each stop, the name of the sponsor is also indicated.
The summit is the remains of a young volcano.
Although data from radiometric age measurements vary slightly, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than Velk<0xC3><0xBD> Roudn<0xC3><0xBD> (3.3 million years old) and older than the Venus volcano (0.8 million years old).
The volcano was born from an explosion.
It spewed out a considerable amount of volcanic ash along with fragments of rocks from the ground, which by burning acquired a reddish-brown color.
At the end of this stage, lava flowed to the surface - today it is a layer of porous basalt up to 13 meters powerful.
The second eruption spewed out red, brown-red, and sometimes black tuffs.
Their layer is powerful up to 50 meters and its part is accessible in the wall of the quarry.
Volcanic bombs up to 1 meter in size are noticeable in tuffs. Even the second eruption ended with a lava spout.
At the end of the activity, lava flowed out of the volcano, which today forms a powerful layer of slag basalt up to 50 m.
Volcanoes that alternate volcanic ash ejection with lava flows are the most common type of volcanoes.
Because they are actually composed of layers, they are called stratovolcanoes.
The original volcanic cone was gradually eroded.
However, it was threatened only by mining in the quarry on the south side.
The most intensive mining took place here in the years 1953 - 1962.
Tuffs were added to the concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
The mining was stopped under the pressure of experts and the public, thus preserving this unique place.
The problem, however, is the porosity and small cohesion of the rocks, which quickly weather, disintegrate and slide down the slope.
The fracture is disappearing pretty quickly.
To make the situation even more complicated, the warm, south-facing slope is an ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
Correction is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
This is nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
Uhl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> vrch can be reached by the green tourist mark from Bruntál or from Slezsk<0xC3><0xBD> Ko<0xC4><0x8D>ov.
Motorists can use the free parking lot at the beginning of the lime alley, where a short educational trail begins.
She moved from the villa to the panel house.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in an apartment villa with a garden and a swimming pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villa districts in O<0xC5><0x99>echovka.
However, the original owners of the house got it back in restitution and the tenants had to move with a small severance pay.
Ivana was therefore quickly looking for alternative housing for herself and her then older mother.
From friends she got a tip for an apartment 3 + kk in an older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor to a large forest park and the dam on the other side impressed me," Ivana recalls of her first impression.
At first, I thought it would be a three-year probationary period.
"We have been living here for more than thirteen years and not only because of the gradual reconstruction, I would not change," the owner adds.
The mother and daughter then moved from a one hundred twenty-meter apartment to a smaller one with an area of 62 m2 and distributed almost all the equipment.
The action was not easy, things were stored by friends and the gradual arrangement took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good condition, but the necessary modifications had to be made, such as painting the doors or changing the windows.
The previous owner demolished the core, but the owner was most bothered by the impractical and unnecessarily large hallway, and on the contrary, a small bathroom.
By combining two rooms, a multifunctional living space was created.
Architects used plasterboard to define individual zones and divide the room, which allowed for a new location of the lights.
The first intervention she made after a few years was the removal of the partition in the living room.
This changed the layout of the apartment to 2 + kk, but the room gained airiness and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step to the partial improvement of the standard was the replacement of the PVC floor with laminate.
Ivana didn't know what to do with the bathroom.
For years, I've been picking up magazines about housing and looking for inspiration.
In one of them I recently discovered an interesting realization.
On recommendation, I addressed the young architect Kamila Doud<0xC4><0x9B>rová.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," Ivana says.
Thanks to the reconstruction of the bathroom, it was possible to adjust the layout of the hall at the same time.
The architect combined the space of the toilet and bathroom and replaced the two doors with one sliding, thus saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and also barrier-free enough.
Quality tiles imitate sandstone, in the shower there is also a comfortable seat, at the toilet bidet shower.
The successful cooperation with Kamila Doud<0xC4><0x9B>rová continued.
As part of the programme How to Build a Dream, a rapid but fundamental transformation of the living room took place, in which the architect Martin <0xC4><0x8C>en<0xC4><0x9B>k also participated.
In the space created by connecting two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping, without being helped by the classical principles of optical division, for example, by semi-diagonals or Japanese walls.
"This would violate the openness and unity of the space," explains the architect.
It was possible to originally separate the sleeping and living areas.
All you had to do was turn your back on two sofas and build a custom-made duvet box between them.
The dining area is defined by the shades of the floor and the paintings.
On the floor in the kitchen and dining area, the architect used high-quality marmoleum, she revived the sliding door with wallpaper with a pattern.
Kitchen corner, if necessary, cover the sliding panels with wallpaper.
The new anti-allergic marmoleum floor has a number of advantages over the previous laminate: a softer non-slip surface without joints and better sound insulation.
The system of niches and ceilings made of plasterboard highlighted in color is an example of how it is possible to work with space in a panel house.
I left the colors on the architects, I wanted it to be joyful.
"I like orange, the same shade I had in the previous apartment," says Ivana.
Graphoglass cladding with a blooming magnolia motif is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
To the warm energetic tone, the architects chose white, which underlined the modern functional style.
In a small apartment, it was possible to store books, among other things, in the space under the window sills.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are conveniently controlled remotely.
In the redesigned interior, the contrast of the new with the older one works perfectly, for example, with the decades-old crystal chandelier and with high-quality art objects that Ivana collects all her life.
The kitchen came last.
The cabinets were previously placed on both sides, and the owner felt a bit like a tunnel.
The architect reduced their number and rearranged the layout.
Furniture in a simple design is made to order, the white area is softened by a slightly pearlescent surface.
A washing machine, dryer and dishwasher fit into a small space thanks to an ingenious solution.
The appearance of a small kitchen revived the all-glass cladding of the walls above the worktop.
The unique graphic glass with a digitally printed motif is attractive, moreover, it maintains itself perfectly.
Ivana chose magnolia flowers, which remind her of her favorite neighborhood in which she lived for years.
Now she seems to be happy here too.
In the original bathroom there was a small bath and a sink, in the new owner chose a neutral shade of tiles.
The large shower room has a Ronal glass door.
The task was to create a clear, simple space from the given environment, in which functions and devices would be in harmony.
We united the interior in material and color and tried to make it look elegant, cozy, not too crowded.
"Another condition of the assignment was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and the availability of everyday items," adds Kamila Doud<0xC4><0x9B>rová.
The Supreme Court has ruled that time can be lost.
The Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as can be prosecuted for any crimes he may have committed before the August dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies.
It was protected only by procedural immunity, which applies to speeches in the House.
In the case of former ODS MPs Ivan Fuksa, Marko <0xC5><0xA0>najdra and Petr Tlucho<0xC5><0x99>a, on the other hand, he decided that they cannot be punished for possible crimes until they gave up their mandate last November, said Petr Kn<0xC3><0xB6>tig, a spokesman for the Supreme Court.
With this decision, the court rejected the motion of the prosecutor Ivo Istvan, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with the deputies.
According to him, they accepted bribes in the form of lucrative posts in state-owned companies for giving up the mandate and not causing problems in passing laws.
On the contrary, it is possible to prosecute the former prime minister who offered them these posts.
An anti-corruption police officer was also detained with Vit Bárta
Bart’s lawyer Old<0xC5><0x99>ich Chudoba, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption of MPs, also did not want to comment too much on the case, but said: “Yes, I represent the client in this case as well, but due to the protection of classified facts, I cannot comment further.”
According to the information, the case is being handled by the General Inspectorate of Security Corps (GIBS).
News server tn.cz reported that Bárta was able to buy classified information from the police.
According to the news server prvnizpravy.cz, the case may have been related to the case of former police president Petr Lessy, whose appointment to the post of Bárt allegedly sought.
However, the latest information Rights shows that the arrest of Vit Bárta is not related to Petr Lessy.
Police Presidium spokesperson Eva Kropá<0xC4><0x8D>ová declined to comment, saying the case was being handled by the Prague City Prosecutor's Office.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified information," said <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánka Zenklová, a spokeswoman for the Municipal Public Prosecutor's Office in Prague, on Friday.
It is the prosecutor there who supervises Bárta’s case, and her words thus indirectly imply that the file or the criminal proceedings are conducted under the secrecy regime.
The Novinky reporter managed to catch V<0xC3><0xAD>t Bárta’s wife Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Klasnova the morning before their residence in Prague’s Klárov district.
She was just loading the suitcases into the car and leaving.
She refused to comment on the whole incident.
On Friday morning, the leader of the Dawn Movement, Tomio Okamura, spoke about Bárta's detention.
In his words, he has no idea what the case is about.
“V<0xC3><0xAD>t Bárta was one of many candidates of many parties on our candidate list, and as I have repeatedly said before the elections, he was not and is not a member of Tomio Okamura’s Dawn of Direct Democracy,” he added.
V<0xC3><0xAD>t Bárta, who unsuccessfully ran for Tomio Okamura’s Movement for the Dawn of Direct Democracy in the past early elections to the House of Commons in the Pilsen Region, is known for his corruption case of bribery of members of the Public Affairs Committee.
In April 2012, he was wrongfully sentenced to 18 months with a delay of 30 months.
The verdict was later changed and Barta was acquitted.
I want a contract in the NHL.
Juice, lust and enthusiasm I still have
For Prospal, family has always been the first priority, so he wants to fully submit to it at the age of 38.
He'll either get a job overseas and extend his career, or he'll be out of hockey for good.
"I want to play the role of father and husband."
"I'm looking forward to it," says the hockey player, who is still waiting in vain for an offer.
Despite the fact that he is a renowned worker who never cheats anything.
Despite the fact that he always leaves his heart on the ice and is able to tear down his teammates.
And also despite the fact that he was Columbus' most productive player last season.
"But the desire to show everyone in me is still there," he says firmly.
He may live to see the New York Rangers, who have failed to make the season, and have injured two mainstays: forwards Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
What does it look like when you come to the Rangers?
It's just speculation.
Until I have something on paper, there's no point in dealing with it.
I know there's an article in the New York Post that says they should sign me, but that's it.
Nowhere has it been said that this has actually happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce that I have a contract, but it's just not the case.
You haven't heard from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place on a daily basis.
It’s about getting into a situation where the contract really comes in.
When a player gets hurt or someone can’t do it and the manchaft doesn’t work.
There's a lot of different factors that have to come together to get this contract.
But that's what happens in New York, isn't it?
Rick Nash is hurt with Ryan Callahan, and the team didn't make it into the season, so there's a chance, don't you think?
Of course, there's always that chance.
But the second thing is that you always need two sides to it.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't gotten any so far.
This is the reality I have to live in.
You're flying to America on Friday, are you expecting anything to come of it?
I've had those expectations since July 5th, when the NHL opened up the free-play market, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remember?
I'm going to Tampa to see the kids and my wife.
I look forward to the sun and seeing you again.
Do you have your program planned?
It's because I'm a father and a husband, and that's where it all comes from.
I’m not a hockey player at the moment – I don’t have a contract and I don’t play games.
So I'm going to be a dad and a husband, and I'm looking forward to it.
Already on Sunday, Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>k has two hockey matches, this is a holiday for me and my whole family, when we can go support our children in what they want to do.
Are you thinking of doing this in full-time quotes?
Sure, you can think about a lot of things.
This can happen, too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 games due to knee surgery.
And I enjoyed it very, very much.
One day it will get to such a stage that all the goals, wins and passes will not replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Whatever job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could happen to me apart from my family.
You’ve had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play in the NHL just because it’s the NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
Since I am a hockey player, the first place - in addition to family - is also sports success.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
This is where family life comes in.
My children, I'm sorry, our children - my wife and I - grew up in the States, started going to school there, and so on.
We would love to see them continue this trend.
Because what we're going to talk about is, in America, the possibilities are somewhere else.
That's the chance we should give them.
Are you planning to stay in the US permanently?
We will continue to practice it as we have done so far.
This means that in the summer we will be in the Czech Republic on Hluboká and around <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
And in winter, back in Tampa or wherever our footsteps take us.
It's perfect to be warm all the time.
I've been very lucky in my life.
You could say that I went to meet him, it cost a lot of strength and renunciation and it took away a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey in return offered me a lot of options, and this is one of them.
That my wife and I can choose where we live.
There are a lot of people in the world who want this, so they can choose what they will do and how they will live.
How long will you be willing to work hard, train hard and wait for an offer at your age?
Yeah, well, that's a question I can't answer.
I still have it in me today, the juice, the lust, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport, the desire and the motivation to prove to people that you still have the NHL, that I'm still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how long it's gonna stay there.
It can't be planned.
So you can say you're going to wait this season to see how it comes out, and then you can decide what to do next?
I'm at a stage where I'm going day by day.
Recently, the CEO of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ announced that the decision to build Units 3 and 4 of the Temel<0xC3><0xAD>n power plant was postponed until the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for the new State Energy Concept and approving the Contracts of Difference by the government.
For these reasons, the current management of CEZ is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - that is, to the majority shareholder.
However, a qualified manager should give a recommendation to the shareholder, and not hide behind it.
Babi<0xC5><0xA1>: The government only with Sobotka.
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is starting to reconcile that his YES movement will not have time to learn the political craft in the opposition and that he will have to go directly to the government in order to form one.
The president admitted this in an interview for Právo, which will be published tomorrow.
Business and marketing of <0xC5><0xA0>koFIN is managed by Abrahamámek
His responsibilities include product and marketing and strengthening cooperation with business partners.
He was replaced by Lu<0xC4><0x8D>ek <0xC5><0xA0>antora.
Abrahamek has spent the last 14 years of his career in the automotive sector.
He worked at Toyota Motor Czech, then at Fiat Czech, where he was responsible for the Alfa Romeo brand and dealers for seven years.
His last job was at Suzuki Motor Czech, where he held the position of manager of the automotive division for more than five years.
<0xC5><0xA0>koFIN was established in 1992.
Police evacuate part of Los Angeles airport after shooting
There was a shooting at the Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
Police evacuated part of the airport, allegedly a terminal three.
Reuters, citing California media, said the gunman was shot dead by law enforcement officers.
The Los Angeles Times, citing police, said two to three members of the Transportation Security Administration were injured in the shooting.
How many people were injured and whether there were any casualties is still unclear.
Firefighters are talking about an event with more injuries.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was to be Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli warplanes reportedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday.
This was reported by CNN with reference to an unnamed official of the US government.
The Israeli press widely reported on the explosion in the alleged missile depot, but the Israeli government did not confirm the attack.
A spokesman for the Israeli military declined to comment on the airstrike.
"We do not comment on foreign media reports," she said.
According to a U.S. government source, the Israeli airstrike targeted missiles and related equipment that the Israelis believe could be transported to the militant Lebanese Hezbollah movement.
The Associated Press, citing another U.S. security official, reported that the target of an Israeli airstrike on a target in Syria was Russian SA-125 missiles.
The second channel of Israeli television reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
Satellite images of the attack area showed a battery of Russian S-125 Neva missiles, according to the DPA.
In addition, they were seen batteries of SA-3 missiles, including a command center with radar to monitor the missiles and their targets.
The rockets are said to have a range of 35 kilometers and could carry a 70-kilogram warhead, according to an Israeli television report.
Israel has reportedly bombed deliveries of missiles inside Syria at least twice this year, CNN and the Associated Press reported.
The Israeli military has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly said it will intervene in any arms shipments targeted at Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorists.
Is the Internet the end of travel?
Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company has updated its annual profit estimate and expects record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual pre-tax base profit to range between $325 million and $340 million, compared with $305 million to $315 million from the previous forecast.
If current developments continue, this will represent a 12 to 17 percent increase from the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
CEO Graham Turner said Flight Centre made an 8 percent profit in the first half of the year, and the second half started off with strong growth, particularly in Australian and British off-business travel.
“To date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are heading for record annual pre-interest and pre-tax profits,” he said.
This includes Australia and the UK, which are traditionally our biggest profit-makers.
Recreational activities have picked up during the second half of the year in Australia, compensating for the slightly weaker domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre performed well in the recreation area, while corporate clients spent less.
U.S. trade recovered from a loss in the seasonally weaker half of the year and is expected to make a third year-round profit.
Flight Centre shares were 3 cents higher at $38.20 yesterday.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transported to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained since September in Russia for protesting against planned oil production in the Arctic were transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
This was reported by AFP with reference to the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
She also claims that the original piracy charges against her activists have not yet been dropped.
“Greenpeace International learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women detained in Russia after a non-violent action against an oil platform in the Arctic were transferred from a detention facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg,” the organization said in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of the detained activists are not clear; according to the DPA, it was a planned relocation.
Authorities initially accused environmentalists of piracy, for which they could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
Last week, however, they announced they would replace the charge with a milder riot, for which there is a lower sentence with an upper limit of seven years in prison.
Greenpeace said in a statement that the authorities had not yet withdrawn the piracy charges as they had promised.
This means that the detainees are now charged with two crimes.
The powerful Committee of Inquiry announced last week that it would replace piracy charges with charges of disorderly conduct.
But when the 30 detainees appeared before the committee this week, the piracy charges were not dropped.
Instead, a new charge has been brought against everyone,” Greenpeace said in a statement.
In mid-September, the Russians detained 30 Greenpeace members from 18 countries on the Gazprom oil platform.
The ecologists were on the ship Arctic Sunrise, which sailed under the Dutch flag.
Since then, they have all been held in custody, against which they filed an appeal, but the court rejected them all.
Environmentalists are complaining about the conditions.
Greenpeace Executive Director Kumi Naidoo said the move to St. Petersburg would facilitate meetings with families and consular staff.
However, there are no guarantees that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact, they can be worse," he said.
One of the detained activists, Faiza Oulahsen, asked for help from King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands.
In a handwritten letter published today by the Algemeen Dagblad newspaper, she urged the monarch to speak about their situation during a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Maliki is said to have played a large part in the resurgence of sectarian violence in Iraq, which he says is partly the result of fighting in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on math, spelling and grammar
At least one Shakespearean play, a 19th-century novella, romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards will have to be studied in English literature classes.
The exam will also include "hidden text" to motivate deeper reading;
Combined English Literature and Language courses will be cancelled.
From 2015 onwards, students will be required to take a language graduation exam, and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an elective subject.
The Ministry of Education is expected to publish new curricula for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo radical change.
For other major subjects, changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, the Ofqual Office, which oversees the graduation exams, will reveal changes in the structure of the graduation exam, along with a new grading system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In a speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was “a broad consensus on whether we need to reform our exam system to regain the trust of society” and that it was necessary to insist that the graduation exam be “more demanding, more ambitious and strict.”
The study shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
For comparison, schools in Australia devote an average of 143 hours per year to mathematics, and in Singapore about 138 hours per year.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to maths, coalition sources said a comprehensive maths graduation exam—along with a greater emphasis on the subject in the results rankings—is likely to encourage schools to provide extra instruction.
The curriculum will focus more on “real-world problems,” including financial mathematics.
Mayor of Ostrava Kajnar: I am not the cancer in the CSSD
Before the elections, a long-running dispute between two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrava <0xC4><0x8C>SSD flared up.
It all came to a head when the mayor of Ostrava Petr Kajnar went to court over the undemocratic selection of candidates.
However, the actors of the case did not want to express themselves too much, so as not to damage the party even more before the elections.
The votes of the voters have now been counted.
The leadership of the Ostrava <0xC4><0x8C>SSD on Monday evening called on the mayor of Ostrava to step down from the party, and will probably also push for him to lose his post.
Petr Kajnar wants to keep fighting.
What is at stake and who is on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview with Dn<0xC3><0xAD>k.
How do you see the outcome of the election?
I think the SNP was expecting a much better result.
Has it been damaged in our country by the fact that disputes within the party were resolved in the media before the elections?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better election result.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which the CSSD is now.
It is a party that has its internal problems, it is internally ill, and people perceive that everything is not right in it.
This was made clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD?
I think the ODS has been going through a decline for some time now, and unfortunately similar things are happening in social democracy now.
It is the case that lobbyists, influential people who previously expected to find their prebends in the ODS, have moved to the people in the CSSD and are influencing them.
It has to do with the fact that the offices of the Ostrava City Hall are visited by the police and collect computers.
It shows that the CSSD is not composed only of people who want the good of everyone else, but many of them think primarily about their own good.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current struggle for power between the Ha<0xC5><0xA1>kovci and Sobotkovci.
This, too, has been prepared for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a foretaste of what is happening now in Prague.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek's wing gradually took up positions so that after the elections it could create a situation that would weaken Sobotka's wing.
In politics, one is in a situation where sometimes one has to compromise.
However, everyone has an internal border, where these compromises can no longer be made, and this is also my case.
Initially, I did not want to run for the Chamber, but when I perceived the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> Zaorálek that I would try to get to the regional candidate to strengthen Sobotka’s wing as the mayor of Ostrava.
But Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek's wing gave him a clue.
Why are you on Bohuslav Sobotka’s side and not Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek’s?
Slavek Sobotka is, in my opinion, a person who always talks primarily about the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD program and, to some extent, about the visions for the party and for this country.
I have to admit, I haven’t heard anything like this from the other side.
Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Presidency, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can just start recalling the party chairman.
This is a struggle for power no matter what and against the party’s statutes.
In my opinion, with what Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has now demonstrated in Prague, he ended his political career.
How did you feel about the fact that the Ostrava <0xC4><0x8C>SSD leadership did not approve of you as a candidate?
Political parties are based on a competition to determine which of their members will be elected.
This competition should for the most part be based on programme visions and on the ability of those people to fulfil those visions.
Of course, people who do not have the power of abilities or vision also apply to this competition, but the political party is for them an elevator to money that they would not receive elsewhere.
The problem is when these people start to get to the forefront by breaking the rules without scrupulously, by violating the party’s statutes.
With their practices, they turn political parties into mafias and, in my opinion, they also violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
To point out this problem is more important to me than taking into account whether any Kajnar has a political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect the statutes.
That is why you filed a motion before the elections for a preliminary measure against the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD candidate in the Moravian-Silesian Region?
The current district executive committee of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Ostrava consolidates its power by the fact that organizations that do not suit it can abolish, purposefully establish new organizations, gradually expel inconvenient party members.
An example is the fact that they wanted to expel Richard Bedna<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k from the club of representatives, but he filed a lawsuit against it and they then canceled the resolution on his expulsion.
This shows that enforcing the party’s statutes through the courts is the last option, but at the moment when the other methods and control bodies within the CSSD have ceased to function, it is the only option.
The effort of the leadership of the Ostrava CSSD, headed by MP Adam Rykala, is to recall you from the position of mayor.
It is a public secret that the mayor of Poruba Lum<0xC3><0xAD>r Palyza has a stake in this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lum<0xC3><0xAD>r Palyza are trying to do everything so that they can recall me.
They promise people positions, they get votes, and then they consolidate their power in the party for those votes.
If I go back in time, everything that happened around the Ban<0xC3><0xAD>k Ostrava football club and the purchase of the Bazaly stadium was just an excuse for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so they could label me as someone who puts money where it doesn't belong.
At the same time, the city bought property that is strategically of great value for it.
How do you see yourself continuing in your role as mayor?
The District Committee has already invited me and other people on Monday to consider our stay in the CSSD.
But I think it's like a thief yelling, "Catch the thief!"
If we look at the results of my work over the past eleven years, I do not see anyone in Ostrava's social democracy who would initiate and promote, sometimes against party members, the emergence of so many development issues, such as industrial zones or the expansion of the science and technology park.
Yet everything is becoming uncomfortable.
I don't read it any other way than to prevent others from breaking into the places they desire.
Will you continue to fight these efforts?
Because if this republic is to function well, so must the political parties.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to manage the state effectively if it cannot manage even itself.
So I don’t think I’m leaving the CSSD now, because I think that the person who is causing cancer on this side is not me, but these people who are trying to piss me off.
Olomouc to open a public ice rink in the historic centre
The organizer of the Olomouc Christmas and winter skating markets, Pavel Spálen<0xC3><0xBD>, said that the preparatory work on the ice rink began on October 26 and the ice production unit has been in operation since Wednesday.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters thick and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The ice rink has an area of 375 square meters, the podium took 358 square meters.
Skaters and passers-by will also have two punch stands.
"We have expanded the floor area, increased the space in front of the stands, and almost the entire area of the podium is roofed so that skaters can comfortably rest," Spálen<0xC3><0xBD> described.
The streets of Olomouc are already reminiscent of the approaching Christmas.
Last year, the ice rink was installed directly in front of the main entrance of the town hall on Horn<0xC3><0xAD> nám<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> to repair the Lower Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed at the end of summer, so that the ice surface could return to its original place.
For the first time, people could skate right in front of the town hall in 2009, when the ice rink was in operation from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the Christmas markets in the city.
Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural program, will be opened on the Upper Square a month before Christmas Day.

The brutal murder of a senior in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n region will be solved again by the regional court
The Regional Court acquitted a 25-year-old Slovak and a 22-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men denied the guilt.
They face between 15 and 20 years in prison or even an exceptional sentence.
Spokesman Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the High Court overturned the regional decision and returned the case to him for consideration.
The judge declined to comment on the grounds that the decision had not yet been served on the parties.
According to the indictment, the young men assaulted a seventy-seven-year-old man in his house.
The old man died an excruciating death.
According to the indictment, the men had strangled, beaten, and kicked him all over his body, and had put about thirty blows to his head with a metal object, probably a gas gun.
The man suffered serious injuries, such as fractures of the skull, swelling of the brain or bleeding into the brain, which he succumbed to on the spot.
The young men reportedly took from the house about 3,000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14,000 crowns.
According to the regional court, they were the only, moreover, only indirect evidence against the defendants of smell traces, which the expert assessed as not fully established within the meaning of the legal guidelines.
Fragrance marks from the crime scene and other cases were in more than ten cases identical to the accused, but the police initially treated them as material and not smelly traces.
In addition, there have been some mistakes in dealing with them.
According to the Senate, the guilt of the defendants has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
The dead elderly man, with a broken head, was found by relatives who thought he had fallen and injured himself.
Even the emergency room doctor did not call attention to the violent death.
Criminals were contacted only a few days later by Olomouc doctors, who discovered signs of violent death during the autopsy.
The police could no longer work with all the clues from the crime scene that the relatives had cleaned up.
No DNA was found at the scene.
The young Slovak lived in Uherskohradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>.
He is currently serving an 8.5-year sentence, which was confirmed by the Olomouc High Court last year.
According to him, the man was the head of an organized group of six young men, which is responsible for the robbery of goldsmiths.
The robberies took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior in Slopn<0xC3><0xBD>.
The younger of the defendants in the murder of the senior lives in Uhersk<0xC3><0xBD> Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>.
He was released from custody in August after 11 months.
Znojmo begins with the reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, reconstruction of the football stadium in Znojmo will begin.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by builders who will carry out the reconstruction of the lawn.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages to meet the standards for the first football league.
Living legend Wayne Shorter will close the next week of Strings of Autumn
Saxophone giant and jazz legend Wayne Shorter will make next Wednesday a dot behind the 18th Strings of Autumn festival.
Shorter will perform on November 6 at the Grand Hall of Lucerne with his quartet of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, Shorter will be joined by a spontaneous jazz improvisation PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the direction of Martin Kum<0xC5><0xBE>ák.
In Shorter's arrangements for the symphony orchestra, Pegasus will be heard from the new album Without A Net, as well as his older compositions Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday in August this year, Shorter is still full of strength, which proves that the Prague concert on the Strings of Autumn will start his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than sixty years ago.
The list of artists he has collaborated with ranges from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey, he also met Czech musician Miroslav Vitous and Vienna native Joe Zawinul, with whom they set the direction of a new fusion style in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade.
For the past 13 years, he has performed with the Wayne Shorter Quartet.
A kind of afterparty after the festival will be the Spotlight club night, which will take place on November 9 at the Roxy/NoD club.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrey Triany, the Manchester trio Go Go Penguin with its electronic-influenced jazz and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska will be presented to the domestic audience, bringing the electro-jazz formation Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
Damkova is said to have banned UEFA from publishing penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damková, chairwoman of the referees committee of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, has stopped publishing sentences for judges.
It is prohibited by UEFA rules, which she said in an interview with the daily Právo.
Otherwise, the FACR would be in danger of being penalized.
Damková also refused to side with the players of Pilsen, where she came from, in her function.
These speculations are really meaningless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the commission are from elsewhere, for example from Prague.
So in the case of a vote I can lose 1:6," Damková said in response to criticism, which was stirred after Plze<0xC5><0x88> recently played twice as many penalties as other league teams.
Although the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R has stopped publishing sentences for judges in recent months, Damková assures that the judges are paying for their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the commission finds out that the referee made a mistake, they will limit his delegation, no matter what the match," Damkova said.
According to Damková, the reason why the penalties are not published is the ban from the European Football Union.
"UEFA prohibits the publication of such information and severely punishes violations."
"We're very suspicious and we're looking for something behind every mistake."
"We have published the restrictions, but I have received two very strong warnings that if we do not stop, tough sanctions will come," Damková said.
The other countries respect the ban.
"We were really an exception," she added.
If the publication of the information continues, the commission could lose money from UEFA for the education and development of referees.
"And they are very important to us."
"Without them, we would not be able to fulfill the program for the education of judges," Damková added.
Bárta’s detention is linked to Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek and Bém: Is he behind the leak of the wiretaps?
The chairman of the Public Affairs Committee, V<0xC3><0xAD>ta Bárta, was arrested by the police on Thursday.
Jan Petr<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>lek, head of the Department of Analytics and Informatics of the Anti-Corruption Police, was arrested along with him.
The arrest is related to the wiretapping of lobbyist Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek and former mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
Information about the interceptors, which came from the server Novinky.cz, confirmed the Czech press office a reliable source.
The intercepted telephone calls of Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek and Bém, published last March by the daily Mladá fronta Dnes, in which the two men address each other as "Mazánka" and "Kolib<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k", show Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek's influence on the steps of the city under Bém's leadership.
The newspaper reported that they were acquired in 2007 by the Security Information Service (BIS), from which they escaped to the ABL security agency two years later.
He owned Bart at the time.
News server Novinky.cz pointed out that the detained criminal Petr<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>lek worked for BIS before joining the anti-corruption police.
Petr<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>lek switched to the anti-corruption unit, which subsequently dealt with the wiretapping at the same time they were published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I cannot confirm anything or say anything at all," prosecutor Michal Muravsk<0xC3><0xBD> of the Municipal Public Prosecutor's Office in Prague said.
He also refused to confirm that he was monitoring the case.
The Commission does not comment on the inspection for the same reason.
Six out of ten companies are preparing for the new Civil Code
Six out of ten companies are intensively preparing for the upcoming effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Law on Business Corporations from 1 January 2014.
Only eight percent of companies surveyed said they had not addressed issues related to both key codes in their company at all.
This is according to a survey by Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, a law firm that surveyed the views of 108 Czech companies.
In connection with the approaching date of effectiveness of both key codes, only now, at the last moment, many managers are beginning to realize what a significant impact they can have on the business of their companies.
In our opinion, the biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Because of the politicians’ lobbying, the business sector has long been uncertain whether or not revolutionary changes will eventually take place.
"Now, however, they have only a few weeks left to make the transition to the new law for their companies without complications," commented Jan Spá<0xC4><0x8D>il, partner at Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal.
Of the 61 percent of companies intensively engaged in the new codes, 26 percent said that their companies had already taken all the necessary measures to be ready in time.
In addition, 35 percent of the companies are preparing to take the necessary measures in the near future.
Against this, every fifth company has not dealt with recodifications yet, yet it has a concrete idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent have no opinion and cannot assess the issue.
Only 8% of companies admit that they have not yet addressed the issues related to recodification.
The most important legal topic related to the new Civil Code is the conclusion of new contracts for the largest number of surveyed companies (21 percent), followed by the resolution of business conditions (16 percent), as well as changes in the real estate cadastre and liability for damage (ten percent each).
In the case of contracts, one of the most important innovations of the entire recodification will take place, namely the unification of the regulation of contracts only within the framework of the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in the Civil and Commercial Code will disappear, as a result of which contract law should become clearer for citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new regulation will offer many novelties with an emphasis on greater freedom of arranging relationships," said lawyer Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Poddan<0xC3><0xBD>.
In connection with the law on business corporations, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the responsibility of statutory bodies to be the most important topic.
The following are topics related to changes in the convening and conduct of the general meeting (15 percent) and representation of the company (14 percent).
The new legislation means stricter obligations and possible consequences for statutory bodies, especially in a situation where the company is threatened with bankruptcy or gets into it.
"In practice, this means that if the members of the boards of directors and executives of companies do not act with due diligence and do not avert the impending bankruptcy of the company, they may lose the benefit gained during the performance of the function only in the last two years," Spá<0xC4><0x8D>il added.
Pierre Rainero: I'm trying to make Cartier's style a living language
My task is to preserve the tradition and at the same time lead our brand to modern things, so that it does not remain a dusty relic, explains Pierre Rainero, director of style at Cartier, in an interview for HN.
This French luxury house was built in 1847.
It travels through mud, river and jungle and provides medical care for free
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend
There are not many doctors in West Africa; only one in 5,000 people.
Vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 nominees for the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year award.
In the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year contest, you can vote for him or any of the top ten nominees.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father fall unconscious again and again and drive to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
In 1981, Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near the Cameroon capital Yaounde.
At first, he was treated only with a broken arm, but then he developed an infection that spread to the brain and there he developed a hematoma that caused him problems all his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, where he received treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five in the morning, rush to the hospital to be there first, but you are not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since the death of Bwelle’s father in 2002, the situation has not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 people in Cameroon.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 population.
And even if the Cameroonian doctors could be visited, many would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of healthcare spending in this country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
Because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen were suffering, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a vascular surgeon at Yaounde Central Hospital.
And he founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas over the weekend to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, nearly 32,000 people have helped with their group of volunteers.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people pile into supplies, attach medical supplies to roofs and travel rough terrain to villages in need of help.
They are not always accompanied by happiness.
More than once, vehicles have to push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they’re greeted like real heroes: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodations the community has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate, and Bwelle – with his wide smile and unbridled energy – is very willing to engage in the local fun.
The next day, the team began treating hundreds of patients.
“We have 500 patients on each trip,” says Bwelle.
They come to the village from a radius of 60 kilometers, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide a variety of medical care.
Many are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches or donated glasses or a birth certificate for free – a document required by the school, but which many impoverished families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations under local anaesthesia.
Surgery is usually done in a school building, in a town hall, or at home; after surgery, the patient gets up and goes to a recovery area to make room for another patient.
Using light from the generator, operating room and hygiene equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of the morning.
It’s exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not to lose motivation.
“To stay awake and keep working, they play drums all night long,” Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team heads back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group – consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free surgeries last year and realizes that their help can mean a lot to the locals.
One man said he'd be able to work again after hernia surgery.
"It will change the future of our family," the man said.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and working as a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private medical clinics around Yaounde.
He says that this second work finances about 60% of his non-profit activities; the rest is covered by private contributions.
“I’m not sure when she’s actually sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia who works as a volunteer for Bwelle’s group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O’Malley who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it’s a great practice they wouldn’t get at home.
“We washed Dr. Bwelle’s hands thoroughly and removed bloodstains or held his tools,” O’Malley said.
As a second-year medical student in America, you will never experience this.
Volunteer students usually pay for the trip to Cameroon themselves and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
But once they arrive at Yaounde, Bwelle provides them with food, transportation, and study.
"He's a hero, no doubt," O'Malley says.
He gives his life to this organization and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, a constant barrage is not a burden.
Helping others live a happier life, fulfilling the promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy doing this job," says Bwelle.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
To make people laugh, to ease their pain – that’s why I do it.

Minister Holcát reinstated the position of Head Nurse for the Czech Republic
The head nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100 thousand.
"I consider it essential that this function be clearly defined and formalized, so that nurses have a representative within the structure of the office - a representative to whom they can always turn if necessary," explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of the nurses and I think that the field of nursing deserves to be given due attention by the ministry as well.
In the pursuit of this profession requires not only high professional professionalism, but also a human approach and personal conviction.
“I will be happy and responsible to try to promote those steps that can improve the position of nurses.”
"We have excellent and skillful nurses in our healthcare system, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who, with their approach to patients, do not help us much, so that they carry out their vocation with all empathy and help us improve the image of nurses in the eyes of the public," says Alena <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>dová.
The newly appointed Head Nurse for the Czech Republic, Alena <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>dová, also stated that she wants to deal with various aspects of the nursing position and intends to cooperate with professional associations, professional societies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors.
“I don’t really want to separate the professions of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary, I see them standing side by side, each with their own competencies and together with other healthcare professionals, they form a coherent working team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient.”
"I myself encounter a number of problems that occur when performing the profession of nurses, I perceive these difficulties and I intend to participate in solving them."
These include, for example, ensuring the simplification of nursing and health documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some administrative tasks of the nurse unnecessarily burden and take away the time that they could and should devote to patients," says Alena <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>dová.
Other areas it intends to focus on include improving working conditions, finding ways to better cooperate with each other in the team and with the management of health service providers, adjusting competencies, as well as labour law issues, such as compliance with the Labor Code or not overloading nurses with their insufficient number at a given time and place.
We often hear anonymous complaints, but they are not documented on a specific case where the violation of the rules could occur due to fear of possible punishment.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, so the position of the Chief Nurse of the Czech Republic could serve in this case as a guarantee of maintaining the anonymity of such a complaint and having a specific case examined by the competent authorities," concludes Alena <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>dová.
Mgr. Alena <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>dová graduated from the Secondary Medical School in the field of Nursing (graduated in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of Charles University in Prague in the study program Nursing - Pedagogy (graduated in 1992).
Since 2010, he has been working as the Head of the Department of Nursing and other non-medical fields and recognition of qualifications at the Department of Education and Science of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Czech Republic.
During her professional career, she worked as a nurse at the bedside in the internal department, then she worked as a teacher at the Secondary Medical School, where she was also a statutory deputy director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she was the chief nurse of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She has published several professional textbooks of nursing and articles in professional journals, she has devoted herself to lecturing in the field of nursing.
He is not a member of any political party.
So that I don't drown in hate
Writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after twelve years.
After many years of reading, living, but not writing, V<0xC3><0x81>CLAV KAHUDA (1965) publishes a new novel Wind, Darkness, Presence.
That it will not be a thin volume, suggests the number of pages comparable to his most famous work Hou<0xC5><0xA1>tina (Petrov, 2001).
Another prominent Czech contemporary writer, Emil Hakl, interviewed for the Kahuda Salon.
What made you decide to write a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it - so as not to choke on hatred.
To see all around us new and new clones of that human foolish pettiness, young organisms affected by blind selfish efforts.
I am not even talking about us elders, faces ruined by powerless lust, vessel souls and oppositely polarized ideologues who are trying to sell their "product" with the expression of a little selling whore.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my juror friends, weirdos and hidden entities.
I'm over it.
Sometimes I feel life on this planet burning in my brain.
I like to go for walks and then read books in the evening by the lamp.
You're talking about a sense of frustration, hatred.
Was there a break in the past that affected you, or are you just getting older, like all of us?
The break came a long time ago, about ten years ago.
It didn't have a name back then.
Well, I lived after that.
But somewhere inside, there's still a surprised, quiet boy.
I see other lonely squeaks, each in his own tornado of anxiety.
Writing books saved me.
I am participating in this enormous, thousands of years-long movement of the life system on this planet – the birth of an unfathomable future.
That immense, breath-taking complexity of life, where every stone is the direct heir to our presence.
We are the players of a sad and beautiful game, where the path of trial and error creates the next and the next generation of beings, which in trillions of interactions per second creates some superhuman, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as an ongoing process, or did you start from scratch?
Self-talk, or rather the dialogue conducted by the right and left half of the brain, sometimes floats to the surface and forms into a book.
As periods of peace are interwoven with silently sleeping metastases of wars that may one day awaken - so my book is twelve years of silence clothed in words.
I could feel the silent avalanche of life growing in my brain, and if I did nothing, one day I would be silently swamped.
It is a set of questions formulated by the brain and posed to layers that are stored in the darkness “under the surface of consciousness.”
The neocortex, the grey crust of the brain, asks the older evolutionary formations, goes to the ancient tree trunks of the brain tree.
He speaks to the furry beasts, asks the snakes, looks for the answer in the flight of birds, lifts his eyes to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry heavens above me.
Finally, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you speak to the ego metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
The brain stores in its billions of connections and electrochemical bonds all the memories, experiences, and experiences that a person has experienced.
This forest of logically and emotionally exposed and branching trees of information, registries of memory, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, being exposed to a constantly changing presence, in an unceasing effort to try to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes there are overload failures.
Analogously - as if you "fall" PC, from the program of the speech emulator and the translator from foreign languages you would get entangled first in the operating environment, for example, Windows, and after several unsuccessful restarts ended up at the dark green flashing screen of Bios, in the basic system that controls the functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between the processor and the operating memory, etc.
For those who have not yet understood what I am talking about, I am talking about a psychospiritual crisis.
You mention it often - why do you regularly care about this type of regression?
Because it's a pit.
In the previously functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - a gap appears.
Nietzsche once said, “He looked so long into the abyss that the abyss looked into him.”
The pure feeling - that a person is lost, if all hope disappears, psychologically "die" and a new quality enters.
Why do I care about it personally?
I'll answer with parables.
Once upon a time, one fell into a pool and was drowning, days, months, and years passed, and he was still drowning and reading, and those books taught him how to swim—that is, how to live.
He became a “scuba diver.”
Perhaps some of the sentences I have written will help someone, as Hrabal’s texts once helped me.
To what extent do you think of the reader, the specific person who will read your text?
The one about which nothing meaningful can be said, some call it consciousness, another super ego, but in my opinion it is best characterized by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
"I'm someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of formulating words and sentences."
From an early age, he read books of old Czech fairy tales, swam in the submarine of Captain Nemo, ran around St<0xC3><0xAD>nadl<0xC4><0x9B> in dark alleys.
In the end, behind all this branching of the authors and their message, it reads: "The sun is bright in the worlds of other Karel Hynek Macha".
What if the book is out?
Do you care about the reader’s opinion?
On a reflection that gets to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, maybe years later, they accidentally contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with some of their difficult life decisions with my book.
Books are, in fact, "lives" or, better said, "worlds."
They are encoded in characters of letters, they carry experience, the history of the regions of which language.
We can bring them to life at any time if we let their sentences flow to the brain.
It is actually, in a way, something forbidden to the divine - to awaken more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It's a fact whose DNA is lined up - according to the old demonological books, we're committing witchcraft.
After the publication of the book - as it happens - a chain of author's readings awaits you.
I remember you used to love to read.
Will you be happy to do it again, or do you feel differently after years?
I prefer to tell stories today.
And what did I find out?
There are smart people everywhere.
Their basic character - they are inconspicuous, they do not draw too much attention to themselves, they have friendly radiance, you do not feel lonely with them.
I will give an example - in the town of <0xC4><0x8C>erven<0xC3><0xBD> Kostelec lived (and I hope that he still lives) one curly bookshopper (called <0xC4><0x8C>ervenka aptly), a cheerful companion and a good girl's bull.
During one drink, he introduced me to the individual links of the chain of readers of my book Hou<0xC5><0xA1>tina.
I looked into their eyes, and then I was shown a shredded, read copy of my book.
Embarrassed, I put down my newly read morning paper and wept briefly.
We all stood there in silence, swaying and tearing drunkenly with emotion.
Then the young blond half-breed could not stand it, and with a roar jumped headlong out of the window into the snowdrift.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran out into the night-time landscape, riding on the happy rabies of the sensitive, the aching soul of the countrymen and the anguish of the fallen patriots - howling and babbling like werewolves until the morning.
Each of your books is different in form and content than the previous ones.
Does this also apply to the text Wind, darkness, presence?
It's a story.
It's a fairy tale about a country beyond nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin in his novella Suchodol puts into the mouth of the folk healer the words of an old Russian fable: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujanu.
There's a dog, a gray box on it.
Horror, horror, mystery.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Maybe we were devils in hell a long time ago, and we drew lots to see what role we would play on this earth.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to leave it on the free tide of inspiration again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and unnameable, similar to the movement of continents on the planet, affects our volition from such a depth and in such a breadth that it completely exceeds our horizon - and so with absolute certainty we act precisely in the intentions of our programmed assignment.
We are rewarded with an influx of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We are biological machines.
We want to mate, we die defending and gaining new personal territories.
Sometimes there's a breakdown and we show compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves human.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various malfunctions, stands on the shore of the ocean unconsciously, and in a leaky sail made of dirty handkerchief catches the tides of a damp wind.
I have to write in order to be human.
Obama steps down from health care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama yesterday backed down from his often-repeated and ambitious pledge that “if you like your health program, you can keep it.”
Referring to hundreds of thousands of disclosure notices from providers, Republicans in recent days have accused the president of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday, Obama backed down from his original pledge.
“The vast majority of people who have health insurance can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
In light of what he called a “media frenzy” about the disclosures, Obama urged Americans who have received these announcements to look for new insurance policies in the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration says it should come as no surprise that 5 percent of the population who have purchased insurance on their own may be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Affordable Care Act.
"I'm telling these Americans the truth: you deserve better," Sebelius said in her testimony before the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the internet market had been "poor" since October.
"I'm as disappointed and angry as everyone else," she said.
I will try to regain your trust.
Annoyed, Sebelius said the sentence, which was picked up by a microphone, yesterday to an adviser sitting behind her at yesterday's meeting of the Committee, which took place after a stormy exchange of views with Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, about whether she herself should be involved in Obama's program.
For more than three hours during the hearing, Sebelius repeatedly questioned why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance, and had not purchased the program through HealthCare.gov, which now coerces millions of Americans.
Which billionaire are you going to call next year?
Kellner, owner of the PPF Group, wants to buy the O2 operator.
Both companies confirmed the negotiations and according to various sources from the agencies and from behind the scenes, the hand is already up the sleeve.
The transaction is expected to be announced in November, probably before the start of the LTE frequency auction, i.e. before 11 November.
Kellner’s competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG group.
Under the Sazka Telecommunications brand, the company launched an auction of frequencies for LTE networks.
And to everyone’s surprise, until then, there was no talk of the company’s desire to break into telecommunications.
But Sazka is now led by a very experienced telecommunication man Robert Chvátal.
He started as the marketing director of Radiomobile (now T-Mobile), then became the director of Slovak T-Mobile and lastly headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Sazka plays several cards at once.
She entered the auction and now admitted that she wants to run a virtual at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If it succeeds in the auction, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
Vodafone would probably not like this under normal circumstances, but according to Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny, it could be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from an agreement by rival operators O2 and T-Mobile to fully share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in a tender for LTE networks (as a newcomer can auction a specially designated spectrum), Vodafone does not have to go to the auction at all, or it will not mind auctioning only a limited spectrum (there are not enough frequencies for everyone).
Vodafone can share the network with Sazka.
Vodafone will launch Sazka into its 2G/3G network (or the newly built LTE network at a frequency of 900 MHz), which will allow the company to quickly start the network.
In the meantime, the Sezka will start building an expensive LTE network, which will also be able to use Vodafone.
Both companies can be satisfied.
Vodafone could then spend the money saved on a fixed-line internet provider or cable TV.
And Kellner?
He would immediately acquire a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services by purchasing the Czech and Slovak O2 (the Slovak branch is the daughter of the Czech one).
But on the other hand, it is a big moloch that will be waiting for restructuring.
In the auction, Kellner would have already won the LTE network for O2 and very likely in cooperation with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already announced that they will share the network.
The auction could finally be a success, but probably not with the high amounts that the state budget is looking forward to.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárek.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Is it ever possible to do TV without signing up?
The era of President Zeman has entered the legendary scene with the ashtray, so it is not difficult to listen to the complaint that collects documents of harassment of the castle company.
In the past, the traditional influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k has not been documented in this way, let alone signed.
True, the editors took the lead.
The cases described, however, do not answer the question of where such favoritism of some journalists to the Zemanites comes from - whether it is a reaction to a direct order, or, in order not to use vulgarism, a typical manifestation of inappropriate empathy.
And while we assume general depravity, we cannot forgive ourselves the question of whether other, no less unscrupulous power interests, which have not yet been given the opportunity, seek to change the situation on television.
Those who say that in developed countries there are no blatant attempts to intervene politicians in broadcasting are true.
The truth is, however, that this does not mean that there are no complaints against the public media.
The complainants do not dispute their independence.
On the contrary, they criticize mainly what they consider to be a tendency inherent in them, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven’t reached this civilizational stage yet, and this situation is not in our country.
But perhaps in a country that thinks it is the most corrupt in the world, black-and-white stories about bad politicians and good journalists are more comfortable than more complicated descriptions of a clumsy situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings collides.
JAN JANDOUREK: Curse of this country: presidents on the verge of power
It is almost a rule that in key moments of the country the head of state was not in such a form as to be able to fulfill his duties as a statesman.
If T. Masaryk had been physically and mentally five years younger, he would have lived to see the end of his presidential term, and the events around Munich would have happened a little differently.
We probably would not have won the war, but after a symbolic resistance, the air force could have flown beyond the borders, heavy weapons could have been destroyed, and the government could have fled to London right away and not fought hard for its legitimacy there.
And most importantly, the nation would not have had a hangover from that surrender to this day.
Bene<0xC5><0xA1> was not a statesman, and he was still in shape under Munich, but during the war it started to go downhill with him and in February 48 he behaved accordingly.
He could have gone into exile for the third time and undermined the legitimacy of the Communists and their coup.
It's a shame to talk about Hacha.
He was elected saying that "Mr. President will not be put in a position to make a decision."
But he had to, even though the big decision with the knife on Hitler’s neck was probably not in the Chancellery.
Until the last days of March 1939, intelligence chief Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Moravec said that everything should be done so that the occupation, which he knew for a day exactly, would not take place so smoothly and with such a profit to the Germans.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, neither did they believe him, nor did they fear him.
Gottwald had his aged comrades executed by human ruin, as Moscow had ordered him.
Ludv<0xC3><0xAD>k Svoboda was finally prevented from participating in the normalization and had to be deposed, already completely senile.
That Husák was helpless and a sick depressed old man made things easier in November 89, but that is the only good.
Havel was lucky not to have met him in office in recent years, he was spared the worst.
Although Klaus is still a fresh tennis retiree, many of his actions suggest that thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
And now we have this.
The head of state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces looks what he looks like, and we do not yet know everything.
Fortunately, there is no external threat to the country.
Or maybe it's a threat, just not seen that way.
Then the question is whether it is exceptionally good (from a historical point of view) that the president is not completely in power.
But it's not normal.
Could we not elect in this country once again someone who is acceptable-thinking and acceptable-healthy?
Distant planets, black-and-white movies, or a little fantasy about extraterrestrial life on earth are not topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter throws casually.
In the concept of his quartet, which will finish this year’s festival Strings of Autumn on November 6th in the big hall of the Lucerna in Prague, everything is connected with everything.
The score of the jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter’s quartet is the current feelings of musicians.
According to his instructions, two generations younger colleagues have to play what they are currently experiencing.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber affair, and they have to think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film images.
However, the 80-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, winner of nine Grammys, former teammate of Miles Davis and probably the greatest jazz saxophonist alive today - does not like to explain this principle.
He does not talk much about music, although his overall view of life and music are closely related.
At the age of 80, I came to the conclusion that the best thing to do is to let life surprise you.
“Too many people plan everything, and then they’re disappointed when things turn out differently,” Shorter says.
How Thailand’s Insects Raised Sales at Paris Bar
You may be grinning at an insect and not know that you are eating about half a kilogram a year on a voluntary basis.
For example, ground in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are definitely trendy: it is ecological, nutritious and you are also taken care of for a unique experience.
He was the first in Paris to list insects on his company’s menu in early October by Elie Daviron, a chef and owner of the Le Festin Nu bar.
The bar, whose name was inspired by William Burroughs’ book Naked Lunch, can be found in the fashionable 18th arrondissement near Montmartre, which is frequented by tourists.
With fresh avocado, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail eggs, guests can now not only eat various larvae, locusts or water beetles, but also scorpions.
Carefully and specially packaged supplies (so that the insects do not damage their wings, bend their legs or damage their eyes) are sent to Daviron all the way from Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, elsewhere it is common.
The owner of a Parisian bar with a pioneering menu gives several reasons to consume insects.
The first is the environmental benefit, because insect production is much less expensive for our planet (in terms of finance, space and water consumption) than traditional meat.
"In addition, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids," Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef does not deny his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, it makes the right restaurant a pleasure, a sense of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just facilitating a new experience," he said.
Not everyone would be thrilled by the idea of eating a pest-decorated beetle, but the reactions of customers of the Parisian bar to the served insects are very positive, according to the owner.
Even skeptics are said to eventually taste it, even if they start with the smallest bites and choose a scorpion in the end.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
Václav Matyá<0xC5><0xA1>, President of the Association of Entrepreneurs in the Construction Industry in the Czech Republic: The New Green Economy Should Continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction industry has been facing a continuous decline in the volume of orders and the state's lack of interest in solving the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings Programme was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who will save considerable amounts for heating after the implementation of the measures, but also a chance for construction companies and manufacturers of building materials.
Each billion invested will bring more than 2,700 new jobs to the state.
From the point of view of the fiscal policy of the state, leverage and multiplier effects are significant, it is also one of the most important pro-growth measures.
Therefore, the Association of Entrepreneurs in the Construction Industry in the Czech Republic fundamentally disagrees with the government’s resolution and asks for the implementation of such steps that would allow further continuation of the program so that further calls can be announced within it.

The dog rolled up the carpet, the president tripped and ended up on crutches
President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman left the Motol hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night in bed, and went to the chateau in Lány.
What's her medical condition?
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said American espionage had “gone too far.”
John Kerry hinted at softening the U.S. defense posture on its surveillance programs, and in an unprecedented admission said that in some cases, espionage “has gone too far.”
The Secretary of State also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting as “autopilots” in the face of outrageous revelations about NSA spying that emerged thanks to whistleblower Edward Snowden.
The revelations sparked a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the president and I and others in the government really learned about some of the things that happened out of inertia, because that possibility was, with reference to World War II, a difficult period of the Cold War and then, of course, 9/11.”
He was the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed the border, but stressed that no one’s rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it's gone too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify this to the people, and he is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that there has been an abuse.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was working for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We are facing a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to kill and blow people up and attack governments.
And what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happened?
In fact, we have prevented planes from crashing, buildings from exploding, and people from being executed, because we can already learn about these plans in advance.
The chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday that U.S. lawmakers were preparing to go to Europe to respond to foreign concerns about alleged U.S. spying and to convince Europeans that they needed to continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy, from Connecticut, said he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terror organizations because they were disillusioned by the surveillance of the National Security Agency (NSA).
It is indeed important for US national security interests that Europe remains on the same boat with us, given the joint efforts in the fight against terrorism, said Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
And I am heading to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger at NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA was collecting millions of phone records in Europe disrupted relations with some US allies, although the agency’s chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata NATO allies were collecting and sharing with the United States.
Another revelation cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA monitored the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other world leaders.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended the spying of the allies as necessary, saying it was a normal matter on both sides.
In the midst of the turmoil, Murphy said his office was planning a parliamentary trip to take place this year, and he hoped members of both parties and chambers would appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of other legislators who intend to participate are to be published.
He said the program is still being worked on.
Although Murphy said the goal of the trip was to help mend relationships, he added that “well-intentioned educational measures” would also be prepared.
He said European leaders must be honest with their own people about the spying programs they have been using for years.
“While we are adjusting our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to be aware of the fact that we are not the only ones spying here,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is heading to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to respond to the hostility unleashed by U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. surveillance activities.
Australian woman appeals against Thai jail sentence
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison on the island of Phuket when she falsely claimed to have been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally charged on June 15 with perjury by a provincial court on the island of Phuket when she told Thai police that a taxi driver, along with two other men who allegedly detained her, attacked her in the early hours of Sunday, June 10.
However, an industrial television recording later revealed that after she broke up with her Australian boyfriend, she returned safely to her hotel.
Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before she was told she had made up the story.
Before the trial, she was held in a local police cell.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison in a low-security correctional facility on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of being placed in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who asked the Canberra Foreign Office for help in his daughter's case.
Tunks told Sydney’s Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had “extreme concerns” about her daughter’s fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"Obviously it's a tough time, but we hope he gets back to us safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the verdict and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
Reports from Australia indicate that she had been on holiday in the Krabi holiday region of southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand say Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she has been warned that the appeal could lead to legal proceedings that increase her sentence and result in her being placed in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agency employee Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be trying to fix the broken image for tourists, which may have been behind the liberating verdict.
Jágr joked: "Goal of the Braille?
He's got a puck in the defensive zone, and no one's caught him.
In addition, the leak was transformed after a quick forehand call.
Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r Jagr scored this way against Tampa on Wednesday night, and on Thursday evening the 119th winning goal in the NHL commented on the social network Facebook.
"After watching this video, the director of Czech Railways called my agent Petr Svoboda and asked him if I would be interested in advertising their state-of-the-art Pendolino train!" he wrote.
I hear we're a lot alike in type.
I guess I'll just have to finish my night workouts so I don't get any faster.
"I'm afraid the Secretary of Defense might call later and want to do an ad for the jets!" he added with a smile.
In addition, New Jersey claimed its second straight victory.
'And most of all, you've noticed - Maria Rottro's treatment is working, 'said Jagr.
Place of post-election candle post-election goulash
The October elections, rather than the winners, brought a bunch of losers.
It is not only the parties that did not even get into the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the CSSD because of their internal split.
Politicians served us post-election goulash instead of a festive candlestick on the weekend.
The election was sparked by Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>’s movement, which promised voters to change the current political style of government.
The fragmentation of the election result and the split in the winning party are recording the political will of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman, regardless of the wishes of voters who did not even elect the party that President Zeman publicly supported to the Chamber of Deputies.
Although the president has lost a strategic lead over other politicians due to the unpleasant event, he still has several ways to get it back - for example, by choosing a future prime minister.
While the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD’s chances of winning the prime minister’s seat are receding in my eyes, the entrepreneurs, on the contrary, are approaching Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Although the post-election development is a mile away from the early and smooth formation of a stable government, compared to the pre-election scenario of the left-wing <0xC4><0x8C>SSD government supported by the communists, this development is still better news for business in the Czech Republic and therefore the economy.
Due to the loud resistance of YES to get together with ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most likely variant of the coalition of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ANO and KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL (a total of 111 deputies).
Given the split in the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, which has thus become an illegible and weak partner in the negotiations, the outcome of the coalition negotiations can be quite disappointing for the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The minority government of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, composed of "non-Aliens" at the Castle, probably will not pass.
Moreover, any government in which the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will participate will be threatened by the unsatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may lead sooner or later to another split in the party.
So I ask myself, "Are we going to have another snap election?"
The next election would be a referendum on the strength of the YES electoral mandate.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD’s plans to introduce sectoral taxes, raise income taxes more significantly or build a state-owned bank fell hopefully under the table.
The parties <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, YES, KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL and <0xC3><0x9A>svit, on the other hand, agree, for example, on the promotion of entrepreneurship, a moderate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), on the promotion of employment of disadvantaged people, a reduction in the lower VAT rate for selected goods.
Tertiary areas are most common in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
YES has the upper hand now, so the program of the most likely coalition YES, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL would lean to the right.
Which, in my view, is ultimately a better outcome than a left-wing program with a tax on everything that is still moving in the economy.
