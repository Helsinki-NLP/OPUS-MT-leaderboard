Father J<0xC3><0xB3>zef Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe
He's charismatic.
The masses are drawn to the Holy Masses for deliverance and healing, which he celebrates.
He was a few years old when inexplicable things began to happen in his life.
Today, through the Franciscans, others are experiencing this.
On the Mass celebrated by Fr. Witko for liberation and healing draw the crowds
Once, the parents of a 7-month-old child came to him, who had a hole in his heart the size of 7.5 mm.
It was to be operated on.
Father Joseph Witko prayed for him.
On the same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for treatment.
The astonished doctors said: "The operation is not needed, the loss is only 1.5 mm."
My parents were crying with happiness.
After another prayer, the Franciscan’s hole disappeared completely.
Spiritually, he began to experience the extraordinary actions of the Creator as a teenager.
In his dreams, purgatory souls came to him asking for help.
I was awakened at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who were dying at the moment.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits a mortal sin.
“My body began to change.
I lost my human qualities and began to take on the appearance of an animal,” he says.
An invisible force was lifting him up, he could not get his voice out of him.
He felt that he was lost.
Then God showed him the way.
“Immersed in the waters of the river symbolizing holy baptism, I was released and returned to human form.”
He didn't tell anyone about these strange experiences.
There was a calling in him.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
In his sermons, he did not just want to talk about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience Him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Community of Renewal in the Holy Spirit
In the masses for healing celebrated by Father Witko, many people who hope to get rid of the disease participate.
However, the priest emphasizes that their main goal is spiritual healing, not physical.
The first defeat of Kolping FRAC Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw
This afternoon (September 26th) the Kolping FRAC team deservedly succumbed to the current Polish champion Dart Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki in the 3rd round of LOTTO Superleague Table Tennis.
The Yaroslavians in such a personal comparison, which they presented with the Grodno residents, have little chance of winning with the sovereigns of the league.
A duel with Darth Bogoria showed it well.
The team still lacks Chen Jingqi, the team leader.
Perhaps with him in the composition of the Yaroslavl would reach the third consecutive triumph in the new season.
Young Asian Qiyao Han has not yet matured to win with such aces as Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, namely Marek Badowski.
The player from Hellada was the biggest star of the duel in the MOSiR hall at Sikorskiego Street in Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw.
Both Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei were a class unto themselves.
After three matches Kolping FRAC led 2:1.
Kou Lei probably played Marek Badowski, and Daniel G<0xC3><0xB3>rak after an emotional, five hundredth fight – Pavel Siruck.
But then it got worse.
Gionis didn't give Leia a chance.
You could still hope to win by two points, but Qiyao Han did not meet Badowski.
There will be no additional research for seniors.
Why? Why?
According to the announcements of Rafa<0xC5><0x82> Trzaskowski, a program of free preventive examinations for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented, because it has not received the approval of the Ministry of Health and the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technologies and Tariffs.
In the justification, the agency explained that the target group was poorly selected.
“These actions may even result in the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to the worsening of difficulties in accessing NFZ services and adversely affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with a false positive test result,” the report said.
The decision of the Ministry does not understand the President of the capital.
“The money is ours, we have the money for it.
Only the government is afraid that if people get tested, then later they will go to the doctor, which is absurd, because it is about leading to a situation where prevention can be done faster.
All specialists know that it helps when it comes to the burden of the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand," said Rafa<0xC5><0x82> Trzaskowski.
“It’s hard for me to imagine that expert specialists say: ‘Let’s not study, because there will be longer queues at the doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, it’s not surprising that the health service is in such a state,’” the PO politician added.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all existing agreements
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Thursday at a session of the UN General Assembly that he would break any agreements reached with Israel if the country’s future government tries to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu’s pledge to annex the occupied Palestinian territories.
“If the future government of Israel, which will be established, proceeds to implement this plan, we will cancel all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made,” he said.
“We will reject the whole plan completely and completely,” Abbas said.
“It is our duty to defend all our rights by all possible means – no matter what the consequences – by fully engaging in the implementation of international law and in the fight against terrorism,” said the Palestinian Authority’s president, who made similar declarations in July.
Netanyahu, Israel’s former prime minister, was re-elected on Sept. 17 to form a government.
A week before the election, he announced that if he won, he would declare the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intend to include all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank into Israel.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, then led by Yasser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements sponsored by the United States.
The 84-year-old Abbas also promised to hold a general election in the Palestinian territories during the UN General Assembly.
The last took place in 2006.
“When I return to the country, I will convene local elections in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, and all those who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community,” he said.
Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer at the UN, to exercise the powers of “full members of the UN and all its organs and institutions.”
The Palestinian leader ended his speech by calling on the international community to “force Israel to comply with the United Nations in all respects.”
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas's speech, saying the Palestinian leader "would rather focus at the United Nations on the Palestinian Authority's efforts against Israel than fight the calls for terrorism in the Authority under his leadership."
Danon, however, did not refer to Netanyahu’s announced annexation of the occupied Palestinian territories.
Rescuers want defibrillators in critical points of Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l
The story from the border crossing shows that an automatic AED defibrillator can save lives.
The Regional Rescue Station in Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l wants such devices to be located in critical points of the city.
For their attitude, the officers received congratulatory diplomas from the Provincial Emergency Station in Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l.
The applicant Daniel Cyrnek, the senior applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek W<0xC3><0xB3>jcik are officers of the Podkarpackie Customs and Tax Office in Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l.
On August 28, they were on duty at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medyka. An officer of the Customs and Tax Service noticed an unconscious man lying in the pedestrian traffic zone.
A Chinese activist has died in custody as a result of torture.
He wanted to exercise the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
Cao Shuxia, the activist’s wife, was called on September 23 by the secretary of the Communist Party in her home village to report that her husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
What was the cause of death, he did not reveal.
At the morgue, Cao saw her husband's body mutilated, unrecognizable.
“His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were covered in blood,” she said.
“They wouldn’t let me take my cell phone with me, and there were a lot of cops around who wouldn’t get close to Wang.”
The police insisted on signing a statement that the husband was seriously ill and died as a result of an “accident”.
PLN 105 million for video game companies from the National Centre for Research and Development
Almost PLN 105 million of funding will go to companies from the gaming industry that create innovative solutions.
The National Center for Research and Development announced the results of the third edition of the GameINN program on Friday.
Among the almost 30 projects that supported the NCBR, the development of a virtual platform for creating field games based on the AR game engine creating a real-world map with an application that allows users to transfer data; a test and training platform for verifying practical skills at work and professional development using the world of VR and AI; and an innovative simulation game management using the world of simulation.
The goal of the GameINN sector program is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game industry on the global market by 2023.
According to the NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion, while the forecast for 2019 is PLN 2.23 billion.
“The specially prepared research agenda of GameINN and the support for entrepreneurs already amounting to PLN 300 million under this sector program are an important impetus for the further dynamic growth of the Polish gamedev,” the statement reads.
The video game industry is an excellent example of effective use of the potential we have in Poland.
“Incentives introduced by the government for entrepreneurs who focus on innovation, such as R&D relief, competence improvement programs, IP box or support programs implemented by the NCBR, drive the innovative activity of companies and allow them to compete more effectively in a very competitive market,” said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Gowin, quoted in the statement.
The head of the Ministry of Science points out that the money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of project co-financing, but also remains in their pockets – three quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from the R&D relief in 2018 than a year earlier.
“The amount of deductible costs related to R&D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in more than PLN 300 million in savings for companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in three editions of GameINN,” the Deputy Prime Minister emphasizes.
The Director of the NCBR, Wojciech Kamieniecki, Ph.D., recalls that in the two previous competitions, 78 innovative projects were awarded grants with a total value of over PLN 211.2 million.
The huge interest in the III competition and the variety of applications submitted show that the video game industry has ideas and competencies to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.
“We are particularly pleased that among the selected projects – as in the previous editions – there are projects for solutions not only for entertainment, but also related to industry 4.0,” he adds.
In the third GameINN competition, entrepreneurs, consortia of entrepreneurs and consortia of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply for funding reaching up to PLN 20 million.
The NCBR received 87 applications for a total amount of co-financing of about PLN 317 million.
The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects were awarded almost PLN 105 million in funding.
Detailed information about the results of the III GameINN competition is available at ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sector program is implemented as part of the Intelligent Development Operational Program.
NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated with the Polish Games Agreement, which includes companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga pleads guilty to theft of Kasper Dolberg watch
The incident occurred on September 16.
Dolberg, who went from Ajax Amsterdam to Nice at the end of August, realized after training that his watch had disappeared from the locker room.
Not just any one, because it's worth 70,000 euros.
The angry Dane did not appear in class the next day, explaining his stomach problems.
It was a mystery from the beginning.
The players in the locker room have private safes at their disposal, and the club area is monitored.
According to AFP, Diaby-Fadiga finally confessed to the theft.
The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and other teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised to return the money for the watch to the Dane.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising young footballers in France.
He came to Nice as a thirteen-year-old, and three years later he made his debut in the first team.
He played in seven games this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but the club is likely to dissolve him with immediate effect, according to L'Equipe.
For the time being, he has initiated disciplinary proceedings against his player.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on the matter.
Make sure you wash your hands well.
We all know that you need to wash them (e.g. after coming home or before a meal).
But not everyone knows that in order to actually get rid of germs, you need to do it in the right way.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30-40 seconds for washing to sufficiently remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands
And most of us are shorter.
Warm water and regular soap are enough – it is not true that it must be antibacterial (many doctors even advise against it).
When washing, we rub not only the bottoms and tops of the hands, but also: the tips of the fingers (jointed or single) – rub them with circular movements on the inside of the second hand, the spaces between the fingers (interleave the hands, rubbing the fingers against each other), thumbs – each thumb we cover with the other hand and in such a hug we cover the neck with the right hand.
In an emergency situation (when you can not wash your hands), you should wipe your hands with a wet wipe, and then use an antibacterial gel (in drugstores, from 5 z<0xC5><0x82>).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the door handles or doors with your washed hands (recommendation of the Main Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open it with a paper towel.
Iran's president says he rejected offer of talks with U.S., Donald Trump denies
Tehran did not enter into talks with the U.S. side during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite the U.S. offer to lift sanctions, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Friday.
US President Donald Trump said it was the Iranian side that asked for the lifting of restrictions, to which he did not agree.
According to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, the Americans proposed the lifting of all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.
It would regulate both Iran’s nuclear program and its ballistic missile program.
Rouhani: Iran will not engage in talks in an atmosphere of maximum pressure
The Iranian president said he did not agree to the talks because of the "toxic atmosphere".
He said he had met with U.S. diplomats because he had been persuaded by France, Germany and Britain.
However, he stressed that Iran will not engage in talks in an atmosphere of “maximum pressure”.
“Even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in the 5+1 format, no one can predict what the final result will be,” Rouhani said.
The day before, the Iranian leader said that he did not exclude talks with the United States, and European parties to the nuclear deal accused of favoring US sanctions on Iran.
He added that sanctions imposed on Iran after the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal “are a precondition that does not allow” for dialogue.
“If we can lift this precondition and if America lifts sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America,” he said.
He added that he did not rule out a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a conversation last week at the U.N. General Assembly.
Trump: “Iran asked, I said no”
Donald Trump tweeted that he had rejected the Iranian request.
“Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course I said no!” the US president tweeted.
Tension with nuclear agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran in some form to save the 2015 agreement with Iran, to which they were signatories.
It stipulated that in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions, Iran would abandon its nuclear weapons program and subject the nuclear sector to the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the U.S. withdrawal from the deal in May 2015, other signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the deal in place.
So far, nothing's come of it.
Washington is using the tactic of exerting maximum pressure on Iran, and the sanctions also include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran announced that if it does not receive permission to export raw materials, it will limit its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.

The judge of the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of the hater Emilia, who – according to her words and screens from WhatsApp – participated in stalking against judges, was reinstated on Wednesday for a ruling by the NSA.
The reason: disciplinary proceedings have not been initiated against him, and therefore there is no reason to maintain the order of WSA President Wojciech Mazur to remove him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, the disciplinary spokesman for the NSA, opened an investigation against Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not yet turned into an investigation against him.
Although the NSA, which in such cases acts as a disciplinary court, must deal with the decision of the president of the WSA within a month of its issuance.
In this situation, the judge who publicly talked about his wife’s mental problems in order to discredit her, who, due to suspicions of participation in the hate group, was removed from the KRS office, will return to the court and will issue sentences on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Szmydt denies his participation in the hate group.
He claims that there is no evidence for this except for fake screens and the words of his wife, with whom he is divorcing.
This is exactly what the other judges associated with the “Cast” claim: they are all innocent, there is no evidence.
And it is quite possible that they will bet on their own.
Because the prosecutor’s office did not lift a finger to secure evidence from their electronic media, it is also silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt’s phone, which the phone stopped in June in another case.
The police did not lift a finger to secure the devices of people identified as persecutors in a February report by Judge Waldemar <0xC5><0xBB>urek.
There is no evidence – there is no Smurf case, there is no Caste case.
There is also no case of the head of NIK Marian Banas for renting a tenement house to pimps and hiding income.
The CBA checks his property statements.
And he'll check when he does.
And the Committee on Parliamentary Ethics will not take care of Banas, because the Sejm is suspended (but the State Control Committee somehow gathered to make a curious decision to dismiss Banas' deputies and appoint his lawyer as acting, although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie short story, American, I think, about how a wife comes home and finds her husband with his mistress in bed.
She's so stunned and devastated, she can't utter a word.
She stands at the door numb, and during this time the lover quickly jumps out of bed, dresses and leaves.
And my husband's making the bed.
When the wife regains her voice and shouts: what is it?
Who is this woman?
The husband calmly asks: what kind of woman, darling?
But in the case of "Kasta" or Banasia, it is a parody of the state.
And that's not funny at all.

Kamila Li<0xC4><0x87>vinko in the high jump final
Earlier this season, returning to the competition after the maternity break, the bronze medalist of the World Championships from London 2017, in the first attempt defeated 1.85 and 1.89 and in the second 1.92.
1.94 managed to get it only in the third approach.
“I am glad.
I showed that I can fight, because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the final, I will have to jump better technically," Li<0xC4><0x87>vinko admitted in front of the Eurosport camera.
American Vashti Cunningham and Belarusian Karyna Demidik were the best in the eliminations – 1.94 each.
Both players were the only ones not to lose any weight.
The women's jump final is scheduled for Monday.
Start at 7.30 p.m. Polish time.
Kornel Morawiecki in hospital in serious condition
He was taken to the hospital and doctors described his condition as serious.
It must be added that he is conscious and conscious.
“We believe that it will come out that he will win again.
We all pray that he will recover,” said an anonymous close person of Kornel Morawiecki in an interview with journalists of the “Super Express”.
In the upcoming election, the Prime Minister's father is running for the Senate.
“I am kept alive by my closest family and politics,” said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview he gave to the journalists of “Super Express” two weeks ago.
In January, “Super Express” reported that the 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki went to study at the Military Hospital in Wroc<0xC5><0x82>aw.
“I had strange, disturbing symptoms and went to the hospital.
Turns out I have jaundice.
But the worst was ahead of me.
When a CT scan was performed, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer,” the prime minister’s father said.
A few days later, in the hospital of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Warsaw, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a serious operation.
According to Morawiecki, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain, priest Zbigniew Kras, to the hospital.
The operation took about three hours and was successful.
“I know a lot of people have prayed for me, for which I thank you very much.
Fortunately, I don't have any metastases.
I don't know if I'm going to get chemotherapy yet.
I put myself in the hands of specialists who are rather good-natured.
For now, after this difficult operation, I have to return to some state of usability.
I hope that everything will be fine,” said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview with “SE” in January.
“If I had been tested too late, the situation would have been tragic and I would have said goodbye to this case,” he added.
Krak<0xC3><0xB3>w: Missing 14-year-old
Officers from the City Police Headquarters in Krakow are looking for 14-year-old Nel Stok<0xC5><0x82>osy.
Anyone with any information about the missing person is asked to contact us.
Missing on 26 September in the evening left the place of residence and to date has not returned, nor made contact with loved ones.
She was last seen at Stary Go<0xC5><0x9B>ciniec Street in Krakow.
Nel Stok<0xC5><0x82>osa is 14 years old, measures 167 cm, has blond hair and gray-blue eyes.
When she was last seen, she was dressed in a sweatshirt, gray pants and shoes.
Anyone with any information about the missing person is asked to contact the police at 12 61-52-911, 12 61-53-616 or 112, 997.
The power of Olav jumps.
The title of the report from amateur sports competitions, played on Sunday afternoon, September 15 at the hippodrome at Oleandry Street in O<0xC5><0x82>awa, may be confusing for some.
The way to true power is far, but that is what one of the types of horse competition is called...
The power of jumping competition consists in overcoming higher and higher obstacles by the rider and horse, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed two meters.
It is worth adding here that the long-standing and still unbeatable world record, set in 1949 by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on a horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.
Of course, no one jumped so high in O<0xC5><0x82>awa, but the result of the best local Amazons at 135 cm is also not one of the worst...
The competitions organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other activists of the JKS "W siedle" were a demonstration part of the "Rainbow Equestrian Competitions" played there earlier, which we write about in more detail in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
Eight Amazons entered the competition, training riding in the JKS in <0xC5><0x81><0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC5><0xBA>.
Four of them competed on bitches and four on big horses.
In the first group, Nikola Szo<0xC5><0x82>dra performed best, sitting on the crazy “Sprinter”.
This small, but very dynamic boom started from overcoming obstacles spread at a height of 40 cm, and ended only at a station with an upper beam 125 cm away from the ground.
However, he did not give up easily and only after three consecutive refusals was he removed from further competition by the jury of the competition.
The second place in the pony jumps was taken by Amelia Pawlak, sitting on the "Famy", and the third by Lena Boru<0xC5><0x84> on the "Harmider".
Ambitiously fought the youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping over obstacles on a small mares "Carmen".
Even greater emotions accompanied the starting Amazons and spectators during the competition with the participation of large horses.
Paulina Szewczyk, who sat on the “Declaration” and Anastasia Abramenko, who was driving on the “Aerial”.
Fortunately, apart from minor bruises, nothing bad happened to the Amazons or horses, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A lot of problems with the introduction of the young mare "Vineta" to the park was ridden by Veronika <0xC5><0x81>uczkiewicz.
We needed either the coach’s assistant or another horse for the couple, which was followed by a little crazy “Vineta”.
After passing the obstacle from the parkour, she also went down in full force, so at times in the boxes and at the springboard it became dangerous. "Everything is under control!", Jan Sienkiewicz calmed down a little the frightened spectators, especially the youngest ones.
Since the beginning of the competition of large horses, Marta Masalska has done a great job at the show, sitting on the beautifully presented "Whisky".
This dignified mare, paired with an experienced amazon, after the second approach in the final phase was the first to jump 135 cm and this was the best result of the competition at the time.
After a while, however, the same height was also taken by Paulina Szewczyk at the “Declaration”, Weronika <0xC5><0x81>uczkiewicz at the “Winette” and Anastasia Abramenko at the “Lotka”.
So all these riders went together to decorate the flo and after receiving material prizes in the form of equestrian equipment, and at the end, together with the Amazons on ponies in the rhythm of Radecki’s march, they made an impressive honor round, ending these interesting and exciting competitions.
THANK YOU
Equestrian Sports Club "W Siedle" would like to thank the sponsors of the jump power competition during the XVI "Rainbow Equestrian Competition": the Municipal Office in O<0xC5><0x82>awa, the Water and Sewerage Plant in O<0xC5><0x82>awa, the District Mayor and the company "Mustang".
Max Kolonko breaks away from KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko
KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko is the name of the election committee under which the political formation #R Revolution of Mariusz Max Kolonko was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution addressed its proposal especially to young voters with right-wing views.
Before the elections, Kolonko announced cooperation with Marek Jakubiak or Pawe<0xC5><0x82> Kukiz, but none of these coalitions happened, and the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko could not even collect enough signatures to issue letters in any constituency in Poland.
Now Kolonko announced on Twitter that he has ended cooperation with KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko.
"I will expect from the above-mentioned KWW to delete my name from the name.
I kindly ask you not to connect my person with the above-mentioned entity," he added and announced that he would provide more information soon.
It is not yet known whether the journalist will continue his work, or whether this is the end of the #R Revolution formation.
On July 4, the American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, who is in the US, announced the creation of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has become famous for hosting the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.
“We’ve had enough of politicians, we’ve had enough of your stupid games, we’ve had enough of your amateur rule.
It is time for the authorities in the country to take over the Nation and rule for the good of the Nation,” Kolonko said.
The party’s program includes, among others, issues related to the judiciary (should be elected in general elections), tax changes (comparison of the tax-free amount for all), war reparations (in the form of military aid for the countries of the eastern flank of NATO, with particular emphasis on Poland), holding a referendum on the possession of weapons, limiting the number of deputies or introducing one district.
A few days after the announcement of the new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko began talks with Marek Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko posted on his social media profile information suggesting that #R will join forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions eventually took place.
UBS: Gold close to the equilibrium point
“The euro exchange rate will remain at the level of PLN 4.35 in the coming months, which will be accompanied by a weak economic situation in global markets,” said Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.
“Expectations of maintaining a solid economic growth rate and stable monetary policy speak in favour of stabilising the zloty’s quotations at the current ceiling,” the expert said in an interview with Bankier.pl.
In his opinion, despite the clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise rates in an environment where the vast majority of central banks are easing policy.
“If the zloty is properly priced – euro quotations should continue in the coming months around the ceiling of PLN 4.35 – according to him, Polish bonds are not very attractive.
Bonds from emerging markets offer much more favorable yields than Polish securities,” says Michael Bolliger, Head of Asset Allocation for Emerging Markets at UBS Wealth Management.
According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the global economic situation.
“The global slowdown may deepen, but it should not lead to a severe recession, and at most to a decline in GDP dynamics slightly below zero,” says Michael Bolliger.
“Investors should underestimate global actions that may be hurt by the lack of prospects for resolving the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump’s impeachment procedure and Brexit.
Among the stock markets, Europe should be the least well-behaved,” according to a recent letter to investors by UBS Wealth Management chief executive Mark Haefele.
“Actions from eurozone countries should behave worse than U.S. ones because they are more vulnerable to increased uncertainty around global trade and fears of a slowdown,” the document says.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the hossa in the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the yields of German 10-year-olds even to minus 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the decline in profitability.
However, in the longer term, the profitability of long-term securities should no longer fall, but only short-term ones, thanks to the easing of banks’ monetary policy.
The Fed has the biggest field for rate cuts, which should lead to a weakening of the US currency in the coming years.
The long-term equilibrium point for euro quotations is the ceiling of $1.29, which would mean a 19 percent potential for the single currency to be strengthened against the dollar.
We expect further Fed rate cuts, which will result in smaller differences in monetary policy around the world.
“The current account and budget deficits may not allow the dollar to remain strong in the long term,” Bolliger said.
The Bundeswehr is losing its weapons.
Confidential report of the German Ministry of Education
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has recorded the disappearance of 39 pieces of weapons, 39 pieces of weapons and 19,445 pieces of ammunition, according to a confidential list compiled by the German defense ministry.
The news was reported by the media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the office of the Parliamentary Secretary of State at the Ministry of Defense, Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one piece of weapons and 3,474 rounds of ammunition have been recovered so far.
Among the military equipment that is still missing are, among others: six universal MG3 machine guns, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal guns and two P8 pistols.
In addition, 30 barrels for MG3 machine guns are missing.
The vice-president of the Left party, Martina Renner, expressed concern about the situation.
As she told RND journalists, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is "terrifying".
Moreover, as a result of the investigations, only a small part of the lost equipment was found.
Martina Renner summed up the effects of these actions as a “poor balance”.
She also criticized the fact that the list does not show whether there is also a weapon that was found during the investigation against Lieutenant of the Bundeswehr Franco A. In December 2017, the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening the security of the state and violating the provisions of the law regulating access to weapons.
The officer was accused of plotting attacks on leading German politicians for far-right and racist reasons.
His “black list” of targets, which fell into the hands of the prosecutor’s office, included the then Minister of Justice Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung in Berlin.
Franco A. illegally acquired four firearms, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition and more than 50 explosives.
The crying children on the plane.
How to avoid them?
There is a solution
Japan Airlines has recently adopted a feature designed for people who find it a nightmare to travel with a crying child.
Through the website, the lines allow you to check the layout of seats on the plane.
If a minor is travelling on a given connection until the age of two, the "child icon" appears on a specific seat reserved by the parents or guardians.
Thus, the person using the services of the carrier has the opportunity to choose a place remote from that occupied by the toddler.
The BBC reports that the lines have already reported on the imperfections of this solution.
The “child icon” will not appear when the ticket has been booked by a third party or if there has been a last-minute change of the aircraft.
As you might expect, the idea divided the Internet users.
Some Twitter users point out that the problem of traveling with crying children can be solved with noise-reducing headphones.
They're kids. We used to be kids, too.
“We need to learn tolerance, because soon we will need a map of sitting places for mouth-breathing, drooling, or drunkards,” wrote user G Sundar.
Another internet user noted that he was once disturbed by crying children on a plane, but changed his mind when he became a parent himself.
There is also a lack of supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
“Thank you for warning me about screaming children during the 13-hour journey,” Rahat Ahmed wrote.
Majorca is counting the losses after the bankruptcy of the travel agency Thomas Cook
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not come to Mallorca in October as a result of the bankruptcy announced on Monday by the travel agency Thomas Cook.
Marc Pons, a representative of the Balearic Autonomous Government, said on Friday that among the 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take their October holiday in Mallorca, there are also people who were supposed to travel with companies indirectly related to Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80% of the expected holidaymakers who had to give up their holiday in Majorca next month due to the bankruptcy of the British company are citizens of Germany and the Scandinavian countries.
However, according to Pons, due to the fact that Thomas Cook did not send tourists to the Balearic island in November-April, the losses for the local economy will be smaller.
He revealed that the government of the Balearic Islands has already started negotiations with international operators on the "entry into the market of Mallorca" after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
The Diario de Mallorca newspaper estimates that more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourist crisis in Mallorca.
About 800 are laid-off employees of Thomas Cook’s office in Palma.
Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, when Thomas Cook filed for bankruptcy in many hotels in Mallorca, property owners demanded that guests pay an additional fee for accommodation.
This situation was experienced, among others, by dozens of tourists from Poland.
The government of the Balearic Islands estimates that by Thursday, dozens of hotels in Majorca had stopped operating at least until the end of October in connection with the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook and the companies cooperating with him.
The Diario de Ibiza newspaper on Friday said that most of the hotels in Ibiza that worked with the Thomas Cook group were not planning to close in the coming weeks.
The newspaper recalls that on this Balearic island, a British bankrupt cooperated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the Balearic Islands’ autonomous authorities announced they would ask the Spanish government for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million to cover the losses caused by Thomas Cook’s bankruptcy.
They revealed that the most affected in this archipelago of tourists, about 36 thousand people, is located in Mallorca.
According to data from the government of the Balearic Islands, Thomas Cook owes local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, about 5 million euros for the implementation of contracts for the period July-September 2019.
FIFA Women's Ranking.
Poland still in 29th place, the United States at the forefront
Poland's women's national team is ranked 29th in the International Football Federation (FIFA) ranking published on Friday.
In the same position, the team of coach Mi<0xC5><0x82>osz St<0xC4><0x99>pi<0xC5><0x84>ski was classified in the previous, July ranking.
Weak team matches.
How will it be in October?
The leaders were American women, who recently defended the title of world champions.
The second place in the ranking was held by the Germans, and the third was held by the Dutch.
The Poles are preparing to qualify for the ME.
They were supposed to start with an away match with the Czechs on September 3.
The day before the meeting, due to food poisoning of the opponents, it was postponed by a year.
In this situation, the Polish women will inaugurate their qualification with a meeting with the Spanish women on 12 November in Lublin.
Previously, "White-Red" will play two friendly matches - on October 3 at the exit from Cyprus, and five days later in Kielce with Brazil.
In the group, the rivals of the Poles are the representatives of Spain, the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
The group winners and the top three runners-up will advance directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six teams from the second position will play in the barrages for the last three passes to the European Championships.
16 participants will be matched by the host – England.
Poland's men's national team in the September FIFA ranking fell from 20th to 22nd place.
“Rz”: The smog crushed the government
“The effects of the Clean Air program are negligible, and coal stoves will burn this winter as if nothing ever happened,” reads the first page of today’s “Rzeczpospolita”.
“So far, within the framework of the Clean Air Programme, 82,000 applications have been submitted for co-financing with a total value of PLN 2 billion, of which 48,000 decisions were positive.
The approved proposals amount to a total of over PLN 915 million,” Rz reports, citing data from the spokesman for the Minister of the Environment.
As the newspaper notes, only part of the costs incurred are returned from the program.
The results of the announced noisy program, the newspaper assesses as "modest".
Local governments, quoted by “Rz”, see the failures of “Clean Air” in, among others, too much bureaucracy.
“The program should be much simpler: electronic application, sending invoices by post, possible random control of implementation.
This would streamline the actions,” said Jacek Wi<0xC5><0x9B>niowski, mayor of Lidzbark Warmi<0xC5><0x84>ski.
Activists from the Polish Smog Alarm point out that in the first year of operation, less than 1% of the assumed goal of replacing 3 million smoking boilers was realized.
As “Rz” notes, although the budget of the program is PLN 103 billion for 10 years, that is, annually PLN 10 billion, this amount is virtual.
“In the budget of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management for this year, PLN 1.4 billion was reserved,” we read.
Congress approves F-35 for Poland
B<0xC5><0x82>aszczak: Now the price negotiations
The US Congress has approved the sale of 32 state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft to Poland.
“This is one of the last steps before the conclusion of the contract, but it is not the end of our work,” wrote Mariusz B<0xC5><0x82>aszczak on Twitter.
"We will negotiate hard to achieve the best possible price," the Polish minister added.
Polish F-35 contract
The Polish Air Force will supply 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters produced by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the US State Department agreed to sell them to Poland.
The investment will support the national security and foreign policy of the United States by improving the security of NATO ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the information of the State Department, Poland is to pay $ 6.5 billion for fighter jets.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department noted that the contract will also include the supply of spare and repair parts, training equipment, the provision of engineering, logistics and personnel services, and related logistics and program support elements and personnel training.
The Lockheed Martin F-35
The F-35 Lightning II produced by Lockheed Martin is a single-seat and single-engine multirole fighter of the fifth generation.
The aircraft is capable of performing close support missions, bombing and typically fighter air combat missions.
Thanks to the use of stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable for short-range radars.
The F-35 was recently acquired by Belgium under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace the aging F-16s.
Other U.S. allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, are also considering buying U.S. warplanes.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gender dolls
The manufacturer Barbie has launched a series of gender-neutral dolls.
This is how we fight stereotypes.
Manufacturer Barbie has launched a series of gender-neutral dolls
In addition to Barbie with a different skin color, figure or hairstyle, Mattel has introduced gender-neutral dolls.
Toys from the series "Creatable World" wear wigs.
Therefore, children can decide whether their Barbie should have short hair or long.
Their wardrobe consists of both trousers and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can turn girls into boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothes.
Gender dolls no longer have full lips, long eyelashes and a slim waist or – in Ken’s case – wide arms.
The company believes that children do not like when their dolls have gender norms imposed, and some parents and feminists are convinced that toys made with a specific gender in mind inhibit the ambitions of girls and strengthen traditional stereotypes.
“The new dolls will make all children feel free,” Mattel said in a statement.
Barbie, which appeared on the market in 1959 in a swimsuit and high-heeled shoes, has been repeatedly criticized in the past for propagating “unhealthy female stereotypes,” such as the unnatural proportion of the body, for example.
The company has responded to criticism and has already launched dolls with different skin colors, as well as more rounded shapes.
There were also dolls in the hijab.
Zandberg: a circle or a club Together can have a dozen or more members
Zandberg, asked on ZET radio how many candidates of his party can get into the Sejm from the lists of left-wing groups (KW SLD from which the list starts candidates to the SLD, Spring and Left Together, starting with the common logo "Left"), replied that it depends on the result of the committee.
“I believe that the result of the Left will be very good, because we feel that people are hoping that the Left is not only right, but also has strength,” he said.
According to Zandberg, the left can have 60-80 MPs.
“This may mean that a circle or a club Together will have a dozen or so members.
But it depends on the Poles and Poles.
“I’m not going to guess and tell you how it’s going to happen,” he said.
Asked if the Left Together would have a separate circle, Zandberg replied: “We are agreed that we are diverse, and we will not pretend that this diversity does not exist.
I think that the Poles rewarded this diversity because we showed that by being different, we were able to agree on a common program.”
When asked whether the biggest beneficiary of the joint start is the leader of the SLD W<0xC5><0x82>odzimierz Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that in his opinion the biggest beneficiaries are centre-left and left-wing voters.
In turn, to the remark that the SLD will receive the entire subsidy, he replied that “the aim of the political party is to represent its voters”.
Zandberg admitted that he will vote for himself in the elections to the Sejm.
In the Senate election, he said he was considering it.
“The offer is diverse and there are candidates and candidates in this offer to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to whom my heart is further,” he said.
“I will say very honestly and clearly that if I were in District 44 of the Senate, I would take the election certificate and vote in another district,” he said.
“I don’t think I would have tried to vote for Minister Kazimierz Ujazdowski (the KO-PAP candidate),” he added.
In this district, apart from Ujazdowski, the leader of the Citizens of the Republic of Poland, Pawe<0xC5><0x82> Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS, are starting.
Dakar: The largest mosque in West Africa has been opened
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of a huge mosque, considered the largest in West Africa.
Muslims arrived by bus, car and on foot to the Bopp district, where a new mosque stood, with a capacity for 30,000 worshippers.
The site was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, a member of the Sufi sect of Islam that dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a wetland area of six hectares, donated by the government.
The name of the Massalikul Jinan mosque ("Paths to Paradise") comes from the title of a poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the Brotherhood, revered by followers as a saint.
The mosque is lined with Carrara marble and has five minarets.
The highest is 78 meters.
The mosque will hold 15,000 worshippers inside, and the other could be on the outer esplanade.
In the richly decorated interiors, you can admire the gilded dome, giant chandeliers and hand-made decorations made by workers from Morocco.
The builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the edifice still has no comparison to mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105,000 worshippers.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than 30 million euros, was financed by private donations.
The government, in addition to the land, financed lighting, sanitary facilities and road works worth 10.5 million euros.
Coach Smy<0xC5><0x82>a: Our problem is not Silesia, but ourselves
The pass of eight league matches without a victory, the players of the Crown will try to break in Friday's meeting with the vice-leader of the Silesian Ekstraklasa.
“Our problem is not the people of Wroc<0xC5><0x82>aw, but ourselves, we have to work on what we play,” emphasized coach Miros<0xC5><0x82>aw Smy<0xC5><0x82>a.
The players of Korona last and so far the only victory in the league recorded in the first place, when at the exit they defeated 1:0 beniaminka games Cz<0xC4><0x99>stochowa Rak<0xC3><0xB3>w.
Later, the Kielce recorded two draws and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 to Zag<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>bie Lubin in the 1/32 final of the Polish Cup.
“I am optimistic that in the last seconds of the cup match the players were fighting for the goal, they wanted to draw.
Their fall on the turf after the last whistle was not the result of a collapse, it was only the fall of anger, because they were so close," Smy<0xC5><0x82>a said.
As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, so he will sensitize the team to the game in the lateral sectors of the pitch.
“We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play,” added the coach.
In Friday’s match in Korona, Ognjen Gnjatic will certainly not play for the excess of yellow cards, Jakub <0xC5><0xBB>ubrowski and Michael Gardawski injured will also be missing in the frame.
However, it is encouraging to sign up for a cup match of several players with the desire to play.
“We have a headache, recently it seemed that he would not be there, and now he is,” Smila said.
Defender of the Crown Daniel Dziwniel stressed that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the streak of eight league matches in a row without a victory, while in the top flight anyone can win against anyone.
“We are a good team.
We may not show it on the pitch in the last few weeks, but there will come a time when we will win and we believe it will be on Friday.”
After nine rounds of the Korona Ekstraklasa with a record of five points, he occupies the 15th position.
Silesia has accumulated 12 more and ranks in second place.
Friday’s match in Kielce will start at 20.30.
These trees could disappear from Europe.
“42% of the tree species that make up Europe’s tree population are at risk,” warned the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in the Red Book of European Trees published on Friday.
At the top of the list are, among others, chestnuts and daisies.
IUCN, an organization based in Gland, Switzerland, is publishing a list of endangered European tree species for the first time.
It was drawn up by specialists who, based on research, came to the conclusion that out of 454 species of trees found in Europe (as well as in other places of the world), 42% are “highly endangered”.
Among the causes, the Red Book lists the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, the most endangered are those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent.
As for the typical European tree stand, according to IUCN experts, 58 percent of species are threatened, and 15 percent, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs, are at risk of extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Book lists errors in the exploitation of the forest stand, accelerated urbanization, too intensive felling of trees, followed by forest fires and changes taking place in the European ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and lichens is also strongly threatened.
“The consequences of human activities lead to the gradual extinction of European plant species and pose a danger in Europe to the extinction of important and undervalued varieties that form the basis of European ecosystems and have an impact on the health of our planet,” Luc Bas, who heads IUCN’s European office, said in a statement.
Grzegorz Schetyna: I do not promise 600+
“Today PiS wants to bribe Poles by offering them a handout on credit for their freedom, which will have to be repaid by future generations,” Grzegorz Schetyna said in an interview with Rzeczpospolita.
In his opinion, “the whole policy of PiS is a pic”.
At the same time, the politician promises that “what is given will not be taken away.”
Schetyna assures Jacek Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to defeat Law and Justice.
It is about mobilizing the electorate at the ballot box.
In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this area than Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski’s party.
“Today, conscious people who want to live in a normal state are more than supporters of PiS, a party that has betrayed the values proclaimed, such as modesty, humility, transparency,” Schetyna says.
The leader of the Civic Coalition and the chairman of the Civic Platform also outlined the basic assumptions of the KO election program.
“First, nothing that is data will be received, but it is necessary to set a direction for the future, because PiS deals only with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even after dramatically low investments,” he said.
Secondly, it is about “launching the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work hard – and those who are entrepreneurial”.
Schetyna explains that the KO program included, among others, a project that will give the least-earning Poles more by 614 zlotys per hand, and more to earners – also several hundred.
The politician also noted that he does not want to race for the distribution.
As he said, he will do as much as he can do, but he does not promise 600+.
“I will never allow the Greek option, where the ruling party auctioned off opposition to the distribution, until finally the country’s financial collapse took place,” he said.
Schetyna also stated in an interview with “Rz” that Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
“We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda,” he said.
“Pride walks before a fall.
Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski is such a statesman as Bana<0xC5><0x9B> is crystalline,” he added.
The PO leader also said that he had not yet decided whether to apply for the chairmanship of the Platform.
Argentina: Six Dead Big Condors
In the Argentine province of Santa Cruz found six dead condors, reports TVN24.
Specialists believe that human activity contributed to their deaths.
The big condors were probably poisoned with a means to kill predators such as cougars, foxes or wild dogs.
The animals could have eaten a toxic carcass.
Except for one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were adults.
“This is a great loss to the environment, because the condor must reach 10-15 years to become fertile and capable of reproduction.
So we are losing a protected species, a threatened species,” says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organization.
“I think the use of toxic bait and poison puts not only this species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health.”
“Rz”: They want a jewel for the president
Work has begun on granting the head of state a precious chain.
The idea was supported by Andrzej Duda’s law firm – we read in Rzeczpospolita.
As the newspaper explains, it is the golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignia officially called the jewel of the Republic in the interwar period.
The last time it was used was probably by President Ignacy Mo<0xC5><0x9B>cicki.
“Rz” reports that soon such a chain may hit the shoulders of Andrzej Duda.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and Petitions on Wednesday voted on a motion to amend the Orders and Distinctions Act to reinstate it.
The newspaper writes that this is also not the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of state.
The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was lost with one vote.
This time the work is quick.
At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to this matter, considering that they would consult the Office of the President.
This came in mid-September.
“I would like to kindly inform you that the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position presented in this petition,” wrote then-presidential minister Andrzej Dera.
On Wednesday, the Senate committee continued the case and again devoted little time to the case.
“The Office of the President answered us briefly: it is in favor of restoring it,” said the head of the commission, Robert Mamatov from PiS, quoted by “Rz”.
He submitted a proposal for legislative work, which was supported by the Commission.
Police officers will teach drivers how to drive through the intersection
The police action will be carried out, among others, at the intersection of al. Ciepli<0xC5><0x84>skiego and al. Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudskiego.
The uniformed actions have something to do with the recent complaints of the city authorities against drivers who are not always able to properly behave at the intersection.
On Friday, September 27, police officers begin preventive actions in Rzesz<0xC3><0xB3>w called “Crossroads Crossings”.
It is about eliminating obstacles in traffic: entering the intersection without the possibility of exiting, not adhering to traffic lights or road signs.
“We often think that we are alone at the intersection, and in fact we make life difficult for other drivers,” said Marek Ustrobi<0xC5><0x84>ski, vice-president of the city, a few days ago.
His words resounded at the city hall press conference, where city authorities presented examples of improper movement of cars at intersections, which in effect creates traffic jams.
At that time, the president appealed to travelers for common sense on the road and, among other things, faster movement at the lights or not writing SMS while driving.
The topic was somehow taken over by the Rzesz<0xC3><0xB3>w police officers, who from today begin the action "Crossroads".
What's going on? What's going on?
The aim of the actions is to eliminate the phenomenon of traffic restrictions at intersections by drivers entering them without the possibility of continuing driving.
This is a frequent offense that contributes to the aggravation of traffic jams and the formation of traffic jams.
A fine of PLN 300 and 2 penalty points are threatened.
In addition, the uniform will pay attention to non-compliance with traffic lights or road signs and improper parking in the area of intersections.
They will also observe the lack of fluidity of driving, late start from the signal, free passage of intersections and leaving too long distances between vehicles.
At what intersections will actions be carried out?
Among others, on Lisa-Kuli Street from Jagiello<0xC5><0x84>ska Street; al. Ciepli<0xC5><0x84>skiego Street from Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudskiego Avenue; ul. Targowa Street from Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudskiego Avenue; <0xC5><0x9A>reniawit<0xC3><0xB3>w Square from D<0xC4><0x85>browskiego Street or Hetma<0xC5><0x84>ska Street from Warsaw Uprisings Avenue.
Such actions in the capital of Podkarpacie will be carried out on the next Fridays of October.
They checked the company that disposes of waste from the "Chaika"
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Officials of the Environmental Protection Department of the District of Wo<0xC5><0x82>omi<0xC5><0x84>ski and the District Construction Supervision Inspectorate inspected the installation in the municipality of Zielonka, where waste from the waste water treatment plant <0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Czajka" in Warsaw, on Friday”, said Karol Szyszko<0xC5><0x84>ski, spokesman for the Wo<0xC5><0x82>omi<0xC5><0x84>ski district.
Inspectors from the mayor’s office in Wolomin conducted an inspection in the plant located in the forests belonging to the municipality of Zielonka.
Private Trade and Transport Plant "Dar-Trans", under an agreement with the capital's sewage treatment plant "Czajka" performs waste management services.
“The inspection of the installation was carried out, and the entrepreneur was asked to provide documentation related to his activities,” Szyszko said.
He added that the audit report will be submitted, among others, to the Provincial Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Warsaw.
The last inspection in “Dar-Trans” was carried out by the Provincial Inspectorate of Environmental Protection in Warsaw in the period 29 December 2015 – 11 February 2016.
At that time, it was established that the company did not perform sampling, measurements and tests of groundwater, and also did not have the results of tests of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the “Czajka” wastewater treatment plant.
After the inspection of the village, Dariusz Sobota was called to stop violating the terms of the decision.
Dariusz Sobota is one of the companies collecting waste in the form of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the Czajka treatment plant.
According to the decision to carry out waste disposal at the site, in the forests near Zielonka, waste weighing up to 60,000 tons per year is processed.
The Warsaw Municipal Water Supply and Sewerage Company informed last Thursday that at the turn of November and December 2018, STUOS was decommissioned, which was associated with damage to one of the incineration plant devices.
As MPWiK reported, the monthly cost of their export is PLN 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa supported Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
“You have taken on a difficult task, you can count on my full support,” Lech Walesa told Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska on Friday.
“Mr. President, these are very important words for me,” answered the candidate of the Civic Coalition for the Prime Minister, the leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that when it comes to the situation in Poland, he is now “only a supporter in retirement”.
Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska met on Friday with former President Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa in his office at the European Solidarity Centre in Gda<0xC5><0x84>sk.
A short conversation behind closed doors was also attended by Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa’s son – Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw.
“You have taken on a difficult task,” said Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa after the meeting.
“You can count on my full support,” he added.
“The problems before Poland are familiar to all of us.
Therefore, it is a great hope that you as a woman will cope with these problems, and we all – those who love Poland – will support your actions to the maximum,” the former president said, addressing Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
Very important words
Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska thanked for the support.
“Mr. President, these are very important words for me, because no one like you can talk about freedom, about the constitution, and you know how important this is,” she said.
“Let us show that you can make a different, wise policy, together, but according to the constitution, according to the law, according to respect for others.
This is how you did your revolution, and this is how we want to change Poland,” said Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
Fans in retirement
Walesa, in an interview with journalists, said that he is now “only a supporter in retirement”.
“Of course I’m looking at it.
I hope that we will reverse the course of events, that what was good, proven, we will return.
The separation of powers is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are indispensable.
And all this needs to be cleaned up, all this needs to be restored to normal operation, and I believe that this time we will do it.
Because if not, then we are waiting for the street criterion,” said Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa.
“That is why it is so important for Poles to go to the polls, think about it and make their own decisions.
And that is the most important thing,” Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska added.
“This is the last chance to improve the situation in Poland with a card,” the former president said.
“We need to rebuild the foundation.”
When asked about the most important changes for her to take place in Poland, Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska said: “The President said very well.
We need to build a new foundation on which we can do all other things.
Since the separation of powers does not exist, since the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make it obvious and let everyone know that otherwise Poland will not move a step forward.
ME volleyball players: Slovenia – Poland 3:1 in the semifinals.
On the hot terrain in Ljubljana, Polish volleyball players clashed with Slovenians in the semi-finals of the European Championship.
There was no lack of controversy and discussion with the judges, with the Polish coach Vital Heynen in the lead role.
“White and Red” lost 1:3 and will play for a bronze medal.
The Senate has decided on key legislation.
The Senate passed without amendment the law on disclosure of the assets of the families of the most important state officials and on the flights of the most important people in the country.
52 senators voted in favor of the amendment to the law on the property of families of state officials – without amendments, 14 were against, three abstained.
Thus, the senators decided to reject the 12 amendments tabled during Wednesday’s debate by Senator S<0xC5><0x82>awomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendments were to “civilize” and limit the scope of the information provided in the statement on the financial situation of their own children, the children of the spouse, children adapted to cases where the children remain in a common household with a person obliged to make a statement.
The Act on the Disclosure of the Property of the Families of the Most Important State Officials, the draft of which was created in the Prime Minister’s Office, was adopted by the Sejm on 11 September.
The provisions assume that, among others, the Prime Minister, ministers, deputies, senators, presidents of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as persons at the head of other state institutions, will be required to include in the property statement information about the personal property of spouses, children and persons remaining in the joint spouse.
The Senate also did not propose amendments to the law on the flights of the most important people in the country.
It regulates which flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government planes with the most important people in the country.
The law also specifies who is responsible for maintaining the Central Register of Flights.
Fifty-five senators voted in favor of the bill, 12 opposed it, and four abstained.
According to the bill, any flight of the president will be a flight “performed in an official mission.”
The flight will be accompanied by family members and other persons invited by the President.
On the other hand, the flight in the official mission of the Prime Minister and the Marshals of the Sejm and Senate will be only a flight “carried out in order to carry out tasks directly related to the function performed”.
The law also specifies the list of people who can accompany the most important people in the country during the flight.
According to regulations, members of the delegation may be on board the aircraft – invited deputies, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organizational services; as well as journalists.
According to the law, in case of doubts related to the flights of the Marshals of the Sejm and Senate, the head of the KPRM will ask for their explanation.
If such doubts are not clarified within the prescribed time, the head of the KPRM will be obliged to notify the heads of the Sejm or Senate offices of the impossibility of organizing such a flight.

Poles after the first training in Paris, waiting for the last rival
Polish volleyball players held their first training in Paris on Friday, where they will play in a match for a bronze medal on Saturday.
The protégé of Vital Heynen’s road to the title was closed by Thursday’s 1:3 defeat to the Slovenians in Ljubljana.
There was a lot of noise about their problems with the trip to this duel.
This time it was without such problems – on Friday morning they went with the Slovenians charter to Paris, and a few hours later they trained in the famous Bercy hall.
According to the reports of people present at the class, the trainer of the world champions was nervous.
As Heynen’s assistant Micha<0xC5><0x82> Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not the exercise of volleyball elements.
“We went to the hall, but for the most part it was time for the team.
It was about spending more time together than training.
Talk, think about how to rebuild it all as a team,” he reported.
He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.
“We were brutally brought to the ground.
There is no doubt that we are disappointed.
We always thought we would get back to this game.
We discussed this match with each other in the staff, the coach talked a lot with the players.
As the two main causes of failure, I would point out the ineffectiveness in the attack and much worse than usual dealing with situational balls.
The Slovenians were much better than us in this respect,” he said.
In his opinion, the "White and Red" did not stand in the way of the stress associated with the performance against the co-hosts of the tournament supported by a loud and numerous audience.
He admitted that the world champions could sleep a little smooth way to the semi-finals.
“Maybe if we had a failure in the group stage in a similar style, we would have analyzed this lesson more quickly and then we would have played differently in the later phase of the tournament.
“It’s just a gimmick,” he said.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with Thursday’s defeat will be turned into aggression in the match for bronze.
“I hope that we will show our true colors.
There's a lot to fight about.
“We won the medal in 2011,” he said.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by Poles during this championship.
In the group stage, they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, went to Apeldoorn for the first two group stage meetings, and moved to Ljubljana for the semi-finals.
Nick Kyrgios: severe punishment, but in suspense
The Australian tennis player received a 16-week ban and a fine of $25,000 – in a six-month suspension – for reprehensible words, gestures and actions during recent ATP tournaments.
The ATP World Tour is losing patience with Kyrgios, but they are still giving him a chance to improve.
The summary of the offenses of the most rude professional tennis player in recent years looks dangerous – 16 weeks break plus a large fine, but nevertheless both penalties are suspended for half a year – a trial period in which the embittered athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he has been working for a long time and has achieved a kind of tennis world record – he had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of the discipline for violating the rules of behavior on the court and next to it.
Loud curses, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike behavior, insulting the judge and the audience, breaking two rockets during a losing match with Karen Khachanov – all for this after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid 113,000 dollars.
He also did not play for long in the US Open 2019, but he managed to publicly say that ATP activists “are corrupt”, which hurt the organization’s authorities so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks gave the aforementioned verdict on the suspension of starts and another fine.
Words about corruption, however, he was forgiven, after hearing the accused and knowing the context of the statement.
In the justification, however, tennis activists said that the investigation showed that the behavior of Kyrgios throughout the past 12 months in many cases raised serious objections and constituted an almost constant violation of the rules, that he constantly insulted in a vulgar manner people associated with tournaments and spectators, hence the high penalty.
However, ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the verdict, ordering the public to meet several conditions within the next six months: in ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour tournaments, Kyrgios can no longer in any way violate the rules of the code of conduct of professional tennis players, in particular, he can no longer swear or destroy himself in any way.
He was also advised to seek “continuous support” from mental trainers during tournaments and also outside of the season to consult with people who specialize in solving problems of athletes who do not cope with proper behavior.
Nick Kyrgios’ first comment on the verdict was, “Hey everyone, I can still play.
I just have to control my behavior, that’s all.”
In practice, the Australian will still have at least a two-week break, because in the Lavera Cup his shoulder injury worsened, so he had to give up the next starts in Beijing (30 September – 6 October) and Shanghai (6–13 October).
In the ATP ranking Kyrgios takes 27th place.
This year, he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, he earned more than $ 1.3 million, so even after fines, he will have a lot left.
GUS: Life is getting better in Poland
According to the report on household budgets published by the Central Statistical Office on Friday, 44 percent of them assessed their financial situation as good or rather good.
The previous year this percentage was 37.2%, in 2016 33.5%, and earlier – since 2009, when the statistical office first examined subjective assessments of the situation of households – never exceeded 30%.
A total of 8.1% of households considered their financial situation to be bad or rather bad in the previous year, compared to 11.2% a year earlier and more than 20% in 2009.
The material situation of households of self-employed persons is the best.
In this group, more than 70% of respondents consider it good or rather good.
At the second pole are households of pensioners, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.
The subjective assessment of the material situation of households is also influenced by the number of children.
The worst is done by parents who raise their children alone, of which 32% declare a good or rather good financial situation.
Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60 percent, and among childless households it is 48.8%.
In these statistics, the effect of the 500+ program is clearly visible.
Before it was launched (in 2016), parents raising children alone and large families (with at least three children) assessed their worst financial situation.
Improving subjective assessments of the financial situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid growth of income, primarily from work.
However, this is not all, because the percentage of households that consider their situation good is growing faster than real income.
Moreover, at the level of voivodships there is no clear correlation between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best assessments are formulated by residents of the Opole voivodship, where 48.9% of respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.
Then there are Lubuskie Provinces (47.7%), Silesian Provinces (47.6%), Mazowieckie Provinces (47.3%) and West Pomeranian Provinces (47.1%).
Meanwhile, in Opole the disposable income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) amounted to less than 94 percent of the national average in the previous year, and in Lubuski to 98 percent.
The residents of Mazowieckie (120% of the national average) and Silesian (104%) had the highest incomes.
On average, in Poland, disposable income per person amounted to PLN 1,693 in 2018.
In real terms (after adjusting for the impact of price changes), it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
Compared to previous years, the result is quite low.
In 2016, per capita income increased by 7%, and a year later by 6.3%.
While revenue growth slows down, it also inhibits expenditure growth.
Those per person amounted to PLN 1,187 in the last year, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure per person increased by 1.9% in real terms, and in 2016 by 4.3%.
Household budget surveys suggest that the statistical household currently spends 70.1% of its disposable income, while in 2014 this share exceeded 80%, and by 2006 it exceeded 90%.

The woman wore a white bra under a black shirt, which shined strongly through her.
USA: Three suicides among the crew of the aircraft carrier
Three sailors committed suicide last week aboard the USS George H.W. Bush, the US Navy said.
In the last two years, a total of five crew members of this ship have killed themselves.
The previous suicide took place in July of this year, and the previous one in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
Each of the events occurred on land when the USS George H. W. Bush moored off the coast of Virginia.
So far, the case has been ruled out by third parties.
In addition, the deaths are not to be associated with each other.
“We need everyone involved to come up with suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent another suicide.
I want to emphasize that there is no stigmatization or other repercussions associated with seeking help,” Captain Sean Bailey, the ship’s commander, wrote on Facebook.
Critically critical of the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing.
In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski stressed that in 1981, John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists.
“In fact, every opinion was accepted.”
Later there was criticism of some of his actions.
“For me, the fact that John Paul II was unable to liquidate Rydzyk’s harmful activity is a great shadow over his pontificate.
After all, this redemptorist – a pest of the Church and Poland – developed his media at its best during the life of the Polish Pope,” he explained.
The former PO politician admitted: “there were murmurs of discontent, the Pope said something, once Rydzyk did not accept, but he had the power and for politicking he could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do this, as did his successors,” explained Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski.
“Besides, this fatal case of pedophilia and the actions of the Church, or rather their absence, has occurred.
I ran a little forward, but I wanted to pay attention to the rest of his life.
We know about the scale of pedophilia in the Church relatively recently.
The question arises, how is it possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting things,” he said in an interview with the journalist Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski.
In the opinion of the former politician, the Polish Church is an ally of the Law and Justice Party.
“It must be admitted that in the period of Solidarity the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the Holy Mass, crosses were hung everywhere.
Now these crosses are Pisan, they have become a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the Pisan regime.
I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk shake the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of PiS.
This is the black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will have to pay dearly,” said Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski.
“I hope that Pope Francis will hunt down J<0xC4><0x99>draszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this type,” he concluded.
Hrubiesz<0xC3><0xB3>w: Tomorrow is the 590th anniversary of the county
There will be gala concerts and auctions.
The jubilee gala will be held in Hrubiesz<0xC3><0xB3>w House of Culture.
First, at 10 a.m. in the Church of St. Nicholas, the Holy Mass will begin.
The official opening of the ceremony will take place at 11.30 in HDK.
The Ensemble of Song and Dance of Hrubiesz<0xC3><0xB3>w Land will perform.
The young people from the Stanis<0xC5><0x82>aw Staszic I LO will present a performance entitled “The Hrubiesz<0xC3><0xB3>w District: This is where my family comes from – this is where I live”.
Then the medals "Merited for the county of Hrubiesz<0xC3><0xB3>w" will be awarded.
At 16 o’clock the event will move to the city promenade, where the concerts “Hrubiesz<0xC3><0xB3>w charity for Angelika Zi<0xC5><0x84>kiewicz” will be held.

PZPN pours punishments for the furrows in the stadiums.
Disqualified griffin
The clash between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gda<0xC5><0x84>sk as part of the Polish Cup did not end tragically when Zlatan Alomerovi<0xC4><0x87>, the goalkeeper of the opposing team, missed by millimeters.
After this incident, the match was suspended for 20 minutes.
The PZPN commission investigating this case imposed a severe punishment on Gryf, excluding him from future games.
The club will not be able to compete in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, the fans will not be allowed to enter their own stadium in the next match.
They will also not be able to travel in groups to league matches until December 31.
Burdy at the stadium Widzewa <0xC5><0x81><0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC5><0xBA> was also called by fans of Silesia Wroc<0xC5><0x82>aw.
Here, however, the PZPN judgment was more lenient, because Silesia warned that similar events could occur and sensitized the relevant authorities in this matter.
Despite this, the services allowed to throw over the sector of <0xC5><0x81><0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC5><0xBA> race fans, setting fire to chairs and forcing the host sector.
The match was suspended for eight minutes and the intervening police had to use a water cannon.
The PZPN punished Silesia with a one-time stadium ban in the next match in the Polish Cup and banned the organization of trips to the matches in this and the next edition of the PP.
The travel ban also covered Ekstraklasa league matches, but will last there until December 31.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
GDDKiA plans to exchange markings throughout the managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rzesz<0xC3><0xB3>w
In Podkarpacie, the implementation of the amendment to the regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, among others, the registration of the names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish has begun.
For example, "Lviv" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our province, the changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it is supposed to be easier, clearer and simpler.
The new guidelines result from the amendment of the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
“We should remember that the names of towns in neighboring countries often also have a Polish sound.
Thanks to the change in the law prepared by us, they will finally appear on the signs near our roads.
We are starting the introduction of the new signage from the A4 motorway section in Podkarpackie,” said Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.
In Podkarpacie, the changes will be introduced on 94 road signs along the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total cost of investment?
200 thousand zlotys.
First of all, the new marking will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is planned to be implemented by 1 November 2019.
What should the implementation of the idea look like?
It will be done without the exchange of plates, on the principle of pasting.
They will replace the currently functioning names of the village with new ones written in Polish on existing signs.
Both names will be written in one line – first in Polish, then in the original, in brackets.
This will be a great relief for people who do not know the spelling of the names of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are located.

Someone shot a swan from a windbreaker
In a pond in Zameczno in Lower Silesia, residents noticed a swan with wings problems.
After catching and visiting a veterinarian, it turned out that someone had set up a target for the animal – a shot from a windmill was found in his body.
“Information about the injured bird was received from the villagers of the Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre in Nowa Sola.
According to the report, the animal had broken its wings.
We went to the place.
You could see right away that something was very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely so as not to harm him and not to expose him to additional stress.
The swan was caught and taken to the veterinarian.
After the first X-ray, it was already known that someone had made a shooting shield out of it.
There were fragments of pellets in his body,” says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol, which manages, among others, a rehabilitation center.
Wintering in the resort
“The wounds were cleaned, the bird was given antibiotics, access to water, a safe place in the resort where he will spend the whole winter.
We're trying to strengthen it.
He is not yet able to fly.
To release him now would mean that he would most likely not survive the winter,” adds Walasek.
The staff after the swan undergoes rehabilitation intends to release him in the spring to the same pond.
The authorities of the municipality of <0xC5><0xBB>ukowice, after receiving information about the cause of poor health of the animal, intend to inform the prosecutor's office about the case.
The event took place in Zameczno
Gowin: “we must stimulate Polish, small trade”
“Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, the leader of the Agreement Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Gowin said on Friday.
During an interview in “Signals of the Day” in radio Jedynka, Gowin stated that trade is dominated by international networks that impose such low margins on Polish producers that, in fact, Polish companies cannot develop.
Noting that this problem is very difficult to fight, the Deputy Prime Minister recalled that the PiS government tried to deal with it at the very beginning of the term of office, but received a “counter from the EC”.
“We have won before the tribunal of justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next election and forms a government, we will return to this topic,” he said.
At the same time, he noted that "effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, and therefore small trade."
“It will be necessary to consider whether the government and the state have any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” Gowin said.
In May, an EU court ruled that the European Commission had made a mistake in finding that Poland’s retail tax was illegal public aid.
The Retail Sales Tax Act provided for the introduction of two trade tax rates: 0.8% of the revenue between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% of the revenue above PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was supposed to apply from September 2016.
In September 2016, the European Commission opened proceedings for violation of EU law by Poland.
Brussels argued at the time that the tax structure could favour smaller shops, which could be considered public aid.
It then concluded that the levy had been unlawfully implemented.
It has also ordered the suspension of the tax until its analysis by officials in Brussels is completed.
Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The EU court’s decision in May opened the way for the tax to be reintroduced, but it did not end the case.
On 24 July, the Commission lodged an appeal with the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the press services of the CJEU told PAP that the case is currently at a written stage, in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.
It is not yet known if and when the oral procedure, i.e. hearing of the parties and possible hearing, will start.
It takes a good few to several months from the appeal to the announcement of the verdict.
“This proceeding takes an average of a year,” a source at the Luxembourg court told PAP.
How to dress a child for baptism?
We offer several practical solutions
Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of an infant and his parents.
It is often the first occasion when the whole family gathers around the child, celebrating his appearance in the world.
No wonder, then, that a newly-baked mom and dad want their child to look their best on this day.
However, before you make the final decision about the child’s outfit, consider whether it will also be comfortable.
In stores, you can find a lot of tuning kits that do not provide the child with proper comfort.
So what should you pay attention to?
The basic criterion for choosing a baptismal garment is the age of the child
Until recently, babies of several weeks were baptized, dressed in white sets and put into the same barrels or large pillows.
Today, children entering the sacrament are often older: a few months old, a year old, or even larger.
It is not difficult to guess that such a large consolation needs a slightly different outfit for baptism.
So if your child is three or four months old on the day of baptism, he or she will likely be in a wheelchair or in the arms of his or her parents or godparents.
Therefore, the best way out will be to decorate it in comfortable, cotton sleeping bags or sets.
Although this element of the wardrobe is considered a daily outfit, it is enough to search for its festive variants, for example, with a frill or lace.
For the boy, the body with a print of a bow tie and a harness will be ideal.
In the case of older children, you can afford more fantasy in the outfit.
The girl will look beautiful in a simple, tulle dress
Many parents of girls look forward to richly decorated, frilled baptism dresses complete with coats, headbands and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-breathable materials for their product, in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In search of the right clothes, it will be better to look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton linings.
Delicate, tulle skirts, satin dresses, laces, applications and cute sets will make your little girl look beautiful and feel comfortable.
The perfect outfit for a little gentleman: a cotton suit
Until recently, among the parents of boys, there was a fashion for suits that are a copy of "adult" models.
Polyester jackets and trousers, stiff collars or helmets often made young elegance loudly demonstrate their dissatisfaction.
Today, fortunately, they have been supplanted by comfortable, cotton sets.
Just look at the kits available in Asanti for Kids, that is, soft, sweatpants, and in addition, a blouse decorated with a vest pattern in the front.
These costumes look extremely festive, and at the same time they do not hinder the movements of the child learning about the world.

Voting on the break in the proceedings of the Conservative Party conference
British MPs have voted against a three-day recess in the House of Commons for the Conservative Party’s annual programme conference, the government has asked.
There were 289 votes in favour and 306 against.
Normally, the House of Commons does not meet during party conferences, so that members do not have to resign either from participating in them or from parliamentary meetings.
However, the opposition parties decided that in such a crucial time as the last weeks before Britain’s planned departure from the European Union on October 31, the parliament should not interrupt the meeting.
The government's request for a break was supported by 289 deputies, against 306.
The two opposition parties are already out of the convention.
The refusal to agree to the break can be perceived as political revenge on Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday, the decision was considered illegal and non-existent by the Supreme Court) and for not wanting to apologize for her after the judges’ ruling.
Following the ruling, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, with Johnson’s speech and the ensuing tumultuous debate being the most important event of the day.
Johnson accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding early elections.
“It is time to get Brexit done.
It must be done in order to respect the referendum result.
Brexit must come so that we can deal with an agreement on citizens’ priorities, on health care, on the cost of living.
“Brexit must be done so that we can unite this country,” Johnson said.
The Conservative Party conference is scheduled to start in Manchester next Sunday and run until Wednesday 2 October.
Conferences of the two main opposition groups – the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats – have already taken place.
One of the reasons Johnson gave for the long suspension of parliament was party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
“President Andrzej Duda believes that the anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders,” foreign media write.
The president's spokesman strongly denied the reports.
“It’s just not true,” wrote B<0xC5><0x82>a<0xC5><0xBC>ej Spychalski on Twitter.
Israeli media, including “Haaretz” and “Jerusalem Post”, referring to “Jewish Insider”, write that Andrzej Duda during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora in the Consulate of the Republic of Poland in New York said that Israel is to blame for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who stated in February that “Poles sucked anti-Semitism with mother’s milk.”
Andrzej Duda said that he regretted that Israel did not apologize for the humiliating statements of its politicians.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish ambassador to Israel, Marek Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an attacker who shouted: “Poles, Poles”.
“The quote is not only inaccurate.
This is simply not true,” B<0xC5><0x82>a<0xC5><0xBC>ej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.
He stressed that Duda “never said that Israel is responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.”
According to Spychalski, the portal “invented it”.
According to “JI” interlocutors, during the meeting, there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivor, the Commander’s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland, Edward Mosberg, and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was to agree with President Duda’s words and say that it was the Jews of Israel “such as Israel Katz” who were responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.
According to sources, Boteach was supposed to interrupt Mosberg’s speech.
Who is Banas and what is his fault?
The tenement house rented by the pimps led the journalist to discover negligence in the property statements of Marian Banas.
We summarize another affair that shook the ruling camp.
TVN’s “Superwizjer” journalists have revealed that Marian Bana<0xC5><0x9B>, the president of the Supreme Chamber of Control, in recent years did not enter in the property statement of the 400-meter tenement house, which is located in the Podg<0xC3><0xB3>rze district of Krakow.
Moreover, his tenant was supposed to run a sex business in the mentioned tenement house (and therefore rent rooms for hours).
In turn, the building itself was allegedly from 2016 to secure the repayment of the loan.
The irregularities were pointed out by Bertold Kittel in the program "Supervisor".
The journalist revealed that from Banasio the tenement was rented by people connected with the criminal world to use it as a place of “erotic meetings”.
Clients were to be men using the services of prostitutes.
Bana<0xC5><0x9B> responded vaguely and vaguely to the allegations.
Interestingly, the tenement house rented by the pimps led the journalist to discover negligence in Banasia’s property statements.
The tenement house itself was described vaguely in them, and the income from its rental was to be underestimated.
“The property of Marian Banas and his wife can be worth from 6 to 8 million zlotys.
In total, the spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings[...]," Money.pl writes.
And according to the analysis of the portal, the Banasia tenement house itself was already worth about PLN 3 million.
The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is currently conducting a review of Mariana Banasia’s property declarations for the years 2015–2019.
Bana<0xC5><0x9B> announced that he would suspend his activities in NIK until it is completed. “I will speak to the marshal for a free vacation,” he assured.
The opposition wants an explanation.
“We do not hear that the CBA has expanded its investigation or accelerated the examination of Marian Banas’s property statements.
Therefore, we are forced to bail out the state authorities and submit a notification about the possibility of committing a crime [...],” said MP Mariusz Witczak.
“If a normal Pole had so grossly underestimated the rental value of his property, he would have already had 10 inspections, a tax assessment and a punitive-fiscal procedure,” he added.
He went high, he went low
Marian Bana<0xC5><0x9B> is the new President of the Supreme Chamber of Control.
He was appointed to this position on 30 August 2019, for a 6-year term.
His candidacy was submitted by Law and Justice and adopted by the votes of the party's politicians.
Previously, Bana<0xC5><0x9B> was associated with NIK in 1992-2005., he worked in this institution as a colleague of Lech Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski.
During the first PiS government (2005-2008), Bana<0xC5><0x9B> held the position of the President of the Customs Service, and also the Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015, he again sat on the chair of the head of the Customs Service, and since 2017 he has been managing the National Tax Administration.
Bana<0xC5><0x9B> served for 3 months as Minister of Finance in the government of Mateusz Morawiecki.
Cooler Master launches a graphics card holder
Graphics cards today can weigh a lot, and this naturally makes room for a category of products that would have been in vain to look for on store shelves a decade ago.
Such a solution – a holder for the ELV8 RGB graphics card – was presented by Cooler Master.
The new model of the graphics card holder is not only a functional solution that allows you to more confidently maintain the graphics card without relying solely on the strength of the PCI-express slot.
Cooler Master ELV8 RGB also has an additional task – decorative.
"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoring the order of a police officer will be punished
According to the newspaper, disregarding the order of a certain behavior issued by a police officer is to be a new type of offense, threatened with a fine, arrest or restriction of freedom.
Police unionists want to make this change.
The idea went to the Sejm Committee on Petitions.
“The case is serious, because already every year more than half a million misdemeanor cases are sent to Polish courts,” we read.
The “Rzeczpospolita” has determined that the petition that the Independent Professional Union of Policemen writes to MPs on the amendment of the Code of Offences has a chance of success.
The authors of the petition propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Offences.
It should read: "Whoever does not comply with the request or order of a public official, issued within the limits and on the basis of the provisions of the law, shall be subject to arrest, fine or restriction of liberty."
“Paragraph 3 of this provision speaks of an identical punishment for those who, without carrying out the orders, will prevent or hinder the performance of a professional activity,” the newspaper reports.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told Rzeczpospolita that although he agrees with the main message of the proposal, he fears that if implemented, it could be used in political matters of manifestations.
“In situations of libertarian demonstrations, this would be unfavourable and instead of mitigating the situation, it would even exacerbate it,” he adds.
Statistics from the newspaper show that 86% of citizens positively assessed the police interventions in 2018 and that every month the services take 1.5 million interventions in the city.
Buras is worried about Europe
Jáchym Topol has writing in his blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
His father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important post-war Czech playwrights, today listed in the same row with Václav Havel.
From the beginning, therefore, the curse of talent hung over Jachym, which he tries to use.
After eight years, he returned with “Sensitive Man.”
The protagonists are Buras and So<0xC5><0x88>a, along with their two sons, who do not form a typical Czech family.
They're wandering actors, traveling all over Europe.
He is a Shakespearean lover and a thief, she is a one-eyed translator who does not part with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys from birth did not make a sound, and for the second time stopped in infancy.
But it is not the heroes who are the most important in this story.
All of them are just a background for observing a world in which there is no more room for artistic nomads.
This is the world of a crowded province, a society of old, suspicious people and promiscuous youth.
“Sensitive Man” sometimes turns into an absurd theater.
The narration imitates the didascalia, and the conversations of the characters create this world.
The stage is a Europe full of fears for its future, but also of constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancels 105 flights due to Thomas Cook’s bankruptcy
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has collapsed, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann operates.
However, the company has problems.
Brussels Airlines has announced that it will cancel 105 flights in October due to problems related to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also laid off 75 employees.
All trips with an office that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to receive a refund.
The court in Ghent also declared the bankruptcy of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently, about 12,000 Belgians are abroad on trips purchased from Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were expected to leave the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, Thomas Cook Belgium spokeswoman Leen Segers said the company was now “fully operational” despite the parent company’s announcement of bankruptcy, which caused concern among employees and customers.
The office then calmed down that customers who bought tours in it, will go on vacation.
Thomas Cook, the world’s oldest and one of the world’s largest travel agencies, filed for bankruptcy on Monday night.
The immediate cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse of last-chance talks with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.
Creditors demanded that in addition to the <0xC2><0xA3>900m rescue plan agreed in August, the company earn an additional <0xC2><0xA3>200m as collateral for the winter, when travel agencies tend to have lower turnover.
However, the company’s problems have been growing for several years, resulting in a debt of up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.

“I don’t think Slovenia played fantastically.

G<0xC3><0xB6>rlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for a review
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an unusual offer prepared for newcomers German G<0xC3><0xB6>rlitz.
The measures are intended to help combat the progressive decline in the number of inhabitants of the city.
G<0xC3><0xB6>rlitz is the easternmost city in Germany.
The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140,000 tourists a year.
However, as The Guardian reports, the city is facing significant challenges.
G<0xC3><0xB6>rlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.
The city is also experiencing a steady decline in population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the west of the country, which resulted in a 25% decline in the city's population.
In 2013, it reached 54,000 people.
To combat the depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 applications have been received for the programme.
Two thirds of them were made by residents of large cities.
People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom were also interested in the programme.
“When we applied, we thought that the program was to convince people to move to G<0xC3><0xB6>rlitz,” said one of the project participants.
“Now we feel that it doesn’t matter if we stay here after four weeks or not,” he added.
The city has 7,000 vacant apartments, and unemployment is three times higher than the national average.
Although the city authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main goal of the program is to get the opinions of the program participants.
The information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revitalise smaller German cities.
“We want to know more about what people need, and if they decide to move, what their motivation was,” said program manager Robert Knippschild.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to lure new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first of these was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals for living and working in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in the American Tulsa in Oklahoma.
