Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law on the introduction of administrative responsibility for violation of the term and procedure for payment of goods (works, services) in procurement for state and municipal needs.
This law is designed to solve the very acute problem of non-fulfillment of its obligations by customers in the implementation of public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation when entrepreneurs could not receive payment under already executed state and municipal contracts was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Russian Federation to take the problem under special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not cope with unscrupulous customers who concluded unfunded contracts, tried in every way to evade the assumed payment obligations and included illegal conditions in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in the interests of protecting the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment on public orders, the prosecutor's office has filed 9.7 thousand submissions, according to the results of their consideration, 4.5 thousand officials have been brought to disciplinary responsibility, 533 to administrative, 75 materials have been submitted to the investigative bodies for organizing procedural inspections, 46 of them have been initiated criminal cases.
As a result, the debt to entrepreneurs in the amount of more than 66 billion rubles was repaid.
Moreover, these huge amounts were not accumulated as a result of non-payment of multibillion-dollar contracts.
The fabulous debts resulted in numerous, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs for much more modest amounts.
Here is a typical case.
The head of a small company won a tender for the provision of social transportation services for several million rubles.
The man invested all his working capital, fully fulfilled his obligations, but did not receive the money on time.
The result is a growing financial coma from debts on salaries, taxes, loans, which would have led to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur had not sought help from the prosecutor’s office.
Now in some regions, the problem has been eliminated as much as possible.
Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt under state and municipal contracts, identified by prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt ratios continue to reach critical levels, the prosecutor’s office operates under manual crisis management.
The Attorney-General personally conducts field meetings with representatives of the local authorities, at which all violations uncovered by prosecutors are examined in detail and measures are taken to eliminate them immediately.
Such operational meetings have already been held this year in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg.
The implementation of the Federal Law No. 189-FZ "On Amendments to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences in terms of establishing administrative responsibility of the officials of the customer for violation of the term and procedure for payment of goods (works, services) in procurement to meet state and municipal needs" will be able to qualitatively improve the payment discipline of public customers, which was signed by the President of Russia last week.
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia on the initiative of the Prosecutor General’s Office.
The new law will supplement the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences with an article that provides for a fine of 30 thousand to 50 thousand rubles for violation by an official of the customer of the term and procedure for payment for goods, works and services in state and municipal procurement.
And if the official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offense, then he will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure the application of these legislative novelties in practice.
Civil Rights Group Announces Warning of Movement in Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning to people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group’s statement reads: “The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People’s Travel Warning, valid until August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors, and Missourians to be especially attentive and extra cautious when traveling around the state in connection with a number of questionable racist incidents that have recently occurred here and throughout the state.”
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the movement warning was prompted by a recent Missouri law that made it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the disproportionately frequent targeting of minority groups by state law enforcement agencies.
“You have people who are subject to human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of their skin color, beaten and killed,” Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, told the Kansas City Star newspaper.
“We hear complaints more often than ever before.”
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization against the US state.
The group cited incidents such as the racial humiliation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tori Sanders, a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after running out of gas while on a state trip, and Missouri state police arrested him without charge of the crime.
The warning also mentions a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General’s Office, according to which black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped on the road than white drivers.
“The purpose of the warning is for people to be aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to be prepared one way or another, whether they take the money with them for bail or tell relatives that they are traveling around the state.”
According to the latest data from the FBI’s hate crime reporting program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, making the state the 16th-highest number of hate crimes in the state.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to bring a case against a legal entity for housing or labor discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued warnings for travelers to Texas and Arizona after those states passed new immigration control laws that ordered local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which the ACLU said was meant to increase the number of racially-based checks.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department in relation to other countries, but more recently public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two killed in shooting at police patrol in Egypt
Unknown shelled a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, reports Reuters with reference to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Egypt.
During the shootout, two people, including one police officer, were killed and three people were injured.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement officers.
One of the attackers was detained, the second managed to escape.
Rosturizm supports the law on the abolition of free baggage for non-refundable air tickets
The head of Rostourism Oleg Safonov said in an interview with RBC that "positively" refers to the adoption of the law on the abolition of free baggage allowance for non-refundable tickets.
"It is necessary to create conditions under which a person who does not have luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has luggage," he said.
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the fears of citizens, you will not have to pay for carrying outerwear and a mobile phone in hand luggage.
“It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and declare it, to say that it is to outerwear, to an umbrella, to a mobile phone, to an iPad or even some computer will not have anything to do with it,” the head of Rostourism said.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the rule on free baggage allowance for non-refundable tickets.
The point is that airlines can determine the number of seats and weight of baggage included in the non-refundable fare.
Vladimir Putin ordered to eliminate the pollution of Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting on the protection of Lake Baikal said that in recent years, significant areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution.
He instructed to identify sources of funding, plans and performers for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also instructed to carry out a full-fledged rehabilitation of contaminated areas.
"It is also necessary to deal with the facilities that continue to work here, the treatment facilities of most of them are worn out," RIA Novosti quoted the president as saying.
He also added that the Prosecutor General’s Office of Russia should conduct an audit to identify environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, in the area of the lake there are problems associated with the appearance of spontaneous landfills and a number of violations in the field of ecology by the organizers of recreation.
“I want to emphasize this: not everything in a row to check, here too, the measure should be known, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures,” he said.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General’s Office reported on the reduction of fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed to increase the number of facilities subject to environmental supervision.
We will remind, on June 15, Vladimir Putin in the course of a direct line stated the need to change the legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of the special protection regime.
He was informed about problems with the conduct of economic activities by the inhabitants of the island of Olkhon, which is part of the Baikal natural territory.
The head of the Ministry of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the water protection zone of Baikal, but the government of Buryatia reminded that such a change is not enough, since the restrictions are associated with a number of regulations.
Earlier, the Ministry of Economy proposed to solve the problem by amending the Land Code and the law on environmental protection.
In Yugra there will be a new temple
In the village of Sosva, members of the community from the representatives of the indigenous small peoples of the North "Rakhtynya", together with the residents of the Berezovsky district, take part in the construction of an Orthodox church in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Its location is the river bank, the temple will be clearly visible from afar, so it will serve as a beacon for fishermen.
According to the representatives of the community, the construction work will be completed this year, domes are now installed, church bells are available.
The Igrim EW fleet provided transport support.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, as he is revered by the Orthodox Church as a patron of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sosv<0xC4><0x9B>, fishing gives the settlers work, feeds them.
Locals are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and children even write about it in school essays as a local landmark.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why is Singapore following the law?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in an open-air diner.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, but carefully stores the cigarette butts in an iron box taken from his office.
After the conversation, the businessman goes to the nearest urn - up to it a hundred meters - and throws bulls there.
The fine for garbage in a public place is $ 500 local, - reports Chang.
You know, I've had a reflex since I was a kid: you can't throw a candy wrapper on a bridge, it'll be fined instantly.
There are video cameras everywhere.
And indeed - the sidewalks of Singapore in the center of the city are clean, as if in a museum.
Three months ago, his neighbor’s 18-year-old son painted graffiti on the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced to flogging.
What?!
Imagine that.
He received ten blows with a wooden stick on his buttocks and spent a week in prison.
Corporal punishment is not uncommon.
How Singapore combines the highest standard of living and incredibly harsh laws, the columnist “AIF” understood on the spot.
No one here thinks of abolishing the death penalty,” lawyer Victor Lee Hong explains.
And the government for a long time does not care about the opinion of both the European Union and the United States on this issue.
If a person carries a large consignment of drugs or sells them - he is put on a gallows.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian national was detained at Changi airport, carrying 400 grams of cocaine.
In his defense, the Australian Prime Minister, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the Pope.
He was eventually hanged.
After that, drug couriers carefully travel around our country.
The fact is that in Singapore it is stipulated that the laws must comply with ALL in a row, and not only the modest and poor people.
It doesn’t matter if you are a millionaire, a deputy prime minister, a well-known artist or a resident of the European Union.
There's only one option: If you get a pound of cocaine, you'll be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and everywhere you meet signs with a bunch of warnings, by a simple miracle you give - how many prohibitions in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and you can buy it strictly according to the doctor's prescription (!)
The tourist on arrival, the gum will not be taken away, but it is worth sticking "rubber" in the subway, a fine of 1 thousand local dollars will be thrown in.
In four days, I met two people with white plates around their necks: “I was trashing.”
For throwing a cigarette butt past the urn, in addition to a fine, they are often sentenced to a "link to the janitors": a week to clean up parks and beaches.
6 thousand rubles. pays the "criminal", who forgot to wash off the water in the public toilet, and when trying to cope with a small need in the elevator of a residential house, a special detector is triggered - the doors are blocked and a signal is sent to the police.
Among the very exotic laws - prohibitions on feeding pigeons on the street, public singing and even excessive watering of houseplants (!): it is believed that an abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires, smokers can not carry lighters in the subway, otherwise they will be fined 5 thousand Singapore dollars.
In general, there is a thought: no matter how you try, you will definitely break something.
That’s not true at all,” Mohammed Kabir-Kajariya, the owner of the local travel agency, tries to reassure me.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last twenty years I have not seen anyone attracted to their violation.
Why do they persist?
So that citizens do not relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is strictly monitored.
For example, if a minor is sold cigarettes in a kiosk, then everything along the chain will be punished: the owner of the store will pay a huge amount, the offender himself will receive blows with sticks on the “back”, and the seller will also be beaten and imprisoned.
It is because of such strict laws that offenses in Singapore are very rare.
Is that justified?
Back in the seventies, we had chaos on the roads - motorists ignored traffic lights, drove as they wanted, sat drunk at the wheel.
After the introduction of fines for the year, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, having drunk a portion of whiskey, knows that if they stop, the policeman will not be released for a bribe, they will impose a fine in the amount of the apartment cost and will be sent to prison for years.
To many foreigners, a city-state in Southeast Asia seems like a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, the American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the death penalty" - a guest from the United States was horrified by the general wealth of the inhabitants, "a frighteningly clean airport" and "cultured nature."
Saying such things are unnatural, look artificial, and in principle should not be.
The first days in Singapore and rightly afraid to throw a piece of paper on the sidewalk, you catch yourself if you went to the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the "Little India", and suddenly - the "break pattern": at the bus stop are plastic cups.
"How's that?" you wonder.
That's right, the Singaporeans are laughing.
Everything happens.
Not every such "crime" will be caught on the spot, but you should know that if you are calculated, you will not retaliate - because you have broken the law.
Most often this is enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, the government in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnamese Ho Chi Minh, I moved very carefully - motorcyclists often snatch smartphones and cameras from the hands of tourists.
In the center of Paris is full of dirty bums and beggars.
In our streets, too, not everyone tries to throw garbage in the urns.
Singapore, thanks to a set of draconian fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty) laws, has become the most peaceful, clean and safe city on Earth.
You'll think about it.
This is human nature: remember, and in Russia no one buckled up to drive until they were fined.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not fines, but voluntary compliance with the laws.
And we must think that in Russia, people would also be happy with clean streets, the absence of garbage in the subway and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with a public toilet.
Corporal punishment, thank you.
Otherwise, the laws of Singapore are at least worth taking a closer look at.
Nothing sacred?
The Trump White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when he begins to fight with the statues.
Americans understand this as well as anyone else – hence the deliberately theatrical demolition of a statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump administration’s key ideologues, no doubt knew what he was doing when he carried a symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty during a fierce dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta over the president’s proposals to sharply reduce legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try the statue himself.
Crowds of boat owners and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would lynch him if he tried to do so.
But he attacked its meaning, and especially the meaning attributed to it in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when Emma Lazarus’ poems were added to the pedestal.
As Miller grumbled at Acosta, “I don’t want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that lights up the world.
The poem you are talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.”
Miller put the facts right, but as he said himself, it’s not really about the story.
It’s about the current sound of Lazarus’s astounding words, the only ones in which the state invites not any immigrants, but the poorest: “Your tired, your poor, / your crowds dreaming to breathe freely, / The miserable dregs of your abundant shores.”
Never before have "unfortunate scum" been so visible on our screens.
Miller was not engaged in literary studies - he made it clear that in America, Trump these people are not expected.
This dispute about the meaning of the statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is really a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus – and her friends who fought to put her words on the base of the statue after her death – knew very well that they were committing a completely political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the connection between the French and American republics with the help of a banal classical figure - the female image of Freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: Mother of the Exiled.
The combination of the poem and the image was a brilliant feminist move and a crushing attack on American nativism.
And how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right though to change it back.
The loud-mouthed Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist who heralded Trump’s arrival, reasoned in 2010 that Liberty was inviting no one, rather it was an early neoconservative carrying the flame of America to a world in darkness: “Freedom is moving forward.
It carries the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to light the way to the United States.”
Against the usual Limbo really got to the point here.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as she would be seen by exhausted, unhappy, but hopeful people on the decks of ships after a long and often arduous voyage.
It means literally looking at the world through the eyes of people who are seeking refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue answers them with the words of hope and hospitality they dream of hearing.
And, of course, this is not the prospect that Miller and Trump will ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is needed not to illuminate the path, but to incite hatred, which is the only source of their power.
2017 World Cup: Neil Blake praises the Scottish members of the UK national team.
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when there were only two Scots in the UK national team
Neil Blake, director of the U.K. Athletics Federation, said the 16-person Scottish squad at the World Championships would make a “significant contribution to the team’s performance.”
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for the 2017 London Championships starting on Friday.
Blake believes that Scotland “is born something special” and the UK Athletics Federation should take this into account.
“We know that and we’re trying to understand that and we’re going to support that as long as they have the potential,” Blake said.
“I’ve spoken to people at the Institute of Sport in Scotland and they think it has to do with what they’ve done.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks that what they have done should be done.
The British Athletics Federation: What they did, we have to work with.
People on the street think so too.
I don’t know why it happened, but it’s absolutely brilliant.”
Some of the Scottish track and field athletes claim medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchert – who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5,000 m; and the Eilid Doyle team has chosen their captain.
"Aileen is humble.
Her captain's speech was great," Blake said.
“Many athletes, whether they are Scottish or not, and from where they live or train, have come out of this room feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Eileen put into her were wonderful.”
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will run the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says the 16 Scots in the British team are “incredible”.
The previous record for the number of Scots at the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Ahead is Laura Muir, who specializes in middle-distance running and broke five British and two European records last year.
She'll run 1,500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O’Hare, who will participate in the 1500 m race, is another Scotsman worth paying attention to: he has a successful season behind him, in which there were victories at the qualifying competitions of the British national team and at the Annual competitions.
Doyle remembers his first world championship, when besides her, the only Scotsman in the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says that she is “incredibly proud” that so many of her compatriots not only entered the national team, but in some cases will qualify for medals and fight for the final.
“The captain of the national team is chosen by other members of the team, so it was a great honor in any case, but to know that your comrades voted for you and chose you is a very special thing for me,” she added.
“Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who entered the national team.
It shows how much we have accomplished.
And they are all accomplished athletes who will strive to get on the podium of honor.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was pretty good.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to host the World Cup at home.
So it’s just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of the fact that we’ll be back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to come to his arena and take part in the competition and the atmosphere there will be just wonderful.”
Blocking critics on Facebook: don’t run for public office if you’re not ready to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood what a critical press is.
The Americans loved George Washington, but this did not prevent them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he didn’t shut his mouth to his critics.
In 1783, Washington said, “We can take away freedom of speech, and we, deaf and dumb, will be led like sheep to the slaughter.”
Now I’m going to go to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s subordinates blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The governor's subordinates called this lawsuit insignificant, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "well, what".
“It’s just Facebook,” many will say.
But it's also important.
And this is especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is a surprisingly popular Republican governor in a Democratic-dominated state.
He is in second place in the approval rating among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not a reactionary.
He has shown a firm hand in running the state and a commitment to his principles.
He also deftly uses Facebook as a primary means of communicating with his constituents and jokingly displays his bald post-chemotherapy head on his page.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor’s page – which is declared as an official public forum and is run by administration officials for taxpayers’ money – is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Press Secretary Amelia Ches defended the governor’s actions, arguing that blocking comments is simply their moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers, and haters on the internet.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are real people, not trolls - a teacher, a businessman, a pastor, who appeal to their elected leaders.
All of them say that their comments were respectful, informative and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to the fact that Hogan is a Catholic.
Lakshmi’s lawyer, Sarma Ramana of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
“I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed by his lack of reaction to hate crimes and other recent news,” she wrote in the comments section of the Post article.
“I also don’t like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some immediately say it’s a so-called hoax, instead of admitting that they’re dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens.”
What the governor’s subordinates call a “concentrated spam attack,” others would probably call an “active life stance.”
In the Facebook era, it’s easy to edit your image by simply blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
This is much less dusty work than before, when it required sending people, collecting and burning newspapers with critical fronts, or arresting and gaging protesters.
But that’s exactly what’s happening right now, only in numbers.
Hogan is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who were banned from his Twitter account.
One of the first landmark decisions on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to U.S. District Judge James K. Casheris of Alexandria, the chairman of the Loudon County Supervisory Board violated the First Amendment by banning a voter from his Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bavin was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It must not be so difficult.
In Washington’s time, the era of affordable postal spending made about the same upheaval as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and the authors of anonymous letters greatly undermined his authority.
And even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the pseudonyms “Yurikola”, “Valerius”, “Belizarius” and “Portius” wrote letters to newspapers mocking Washington’s decision.
According to historical documents compiled by the George Washington Papers online project, his office was inundated with petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation.
But he did not try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lies at the very foundation of our state.
And true leadership means agreeing to it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at the Renaissance Club
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty is looking forward to home comforts for the next three days, when the Renaissance Club of East Lothian will host the 25th Scottish Open Golf Tournament for senior athletes.
A native of Northern Ireland, who led the neighborhood at Archerfield Links, and moved towards the final round last year until losing to Paul Ilse, is attached to the new venue and plays the role of tournament representative on behalf of the club's founder and director Jerry Sarwadi.
“I’ve seen how the Renaissance Club has been built and we’ve seen how it comes to success with this event,” Rafferty said.
“The players will see this field at its best, it’s in great condition.
Jerry did a great job arranging this place.
He is an ardent supporter of this game and is proud of his achievements here.
It’s a great demonstration for this field.”
Englishman Ils is looking forward to the opportunity to defend the title for the first time, despite the fact that during his 32-year career he won both the European tournament and the tournament “European Challenge Tour”.
“It’s a really special feeling,” said the Southport player.
“I couldn’t try again to win the Extremadura Open because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
Returning to this part of the world is magical.
This is a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year are coming back, and it was a very special experience for me and my wife, Sharon, to win last year.
It was a really special time and we will always remember it.”
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Athletes Tournament after turning 50 earlier this year, returns to battle in his home country.
The event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
“When you play at home, it’s always a little bit more important,” said Helensboro resident Orr.
“You want to perform well, but you feel that extra burden.”
I was very happy to play again and I showed good golf.
I’m happy with how things are going so far.”
The trio will be joined on the pitch by former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnem and senior champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots on the pitch; the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and parking costs <0xC2><0xA3>5 per hour if there is one person in the car, and <0xC2><0xA3>10 if there are two or more people.
All proceeds go to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
The peculiar tunnels over the highways, capable of absorbing carbon monoxide emitted by cars, are already being tested on UK roads.
The transport agency of the country, according to the publication Autocar, reported positive results of tests of a 100-meter tunnel installed on one of the highways in the north of the country.
The tunnel is 6 meters high and is made of some of the latest polymer materials that are able to absorb harmful substances contained in car exhausts.
However, the creation of a network of such tunnels is only part of the large-scale measures that the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the network of tunnels, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of measures to reduce car traffic on the roads, expand the use of commercial vehicles on electric traction and modernize the fleet of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution is caused by transport, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths a year.
The Moscow City Court changed the punishment of disabled Mamaev for a fine
The Moscow city court changed the punishment to disabled Anton Mamaev, sentenced to four and a half years in the colony, to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
This is reported by TASS.
Earlier, the prosecutor’s office asked the court to replace the term with a suspended one, explaining its request by the fact that Mamayev’s illness “prevents him from being in prison.”
28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years in prison with serving a sentence in a colony of the general regime for robbery, the victim of which was a former special forces fighter.
On July 19, the court released the man from custody at an exit meeting in the pre-trial detention center.
Poverty and death in Indonesia’s ‘golden land’
When cooking dinner, Bardina Degei does not use the stove.
She rarely even uses the pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotala, the capital of Paniai district in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually just puts a sweet potato, which is called "note" here, right into the hearth.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is taken out and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the earthen floor – she has no furniture – and it is here that she does her housework, such as washing her clothes with muddy water from a nearby swamp.
The toilet is a bucket in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of her husband’s four wives, so she was not assigned to work in the field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
“No one dares to walk around the village after five in the evening,” she says.
It is a rare opportunity to look at everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a dubious referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote, publicly raising their hands in front of the occupying troops.
The existing movement for independence from the Netherlands has quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which retains tight control over the region without allowing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent state of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a city as remote as it is abandoned; the road here includes an hour and a half flight from Jayapura, the administrative center of the province, to Nabira, and then a five-hour shake in a hired car.
There is no public transport here.
The city of about 19,000 people consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; the roofs of corrugated steel are painted rusty in a variety of reddish shades.
Few Indonesians got here, not to mention journalists, and almost none of the foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the mee pago worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
“It was unusual for us to wear these clothes,” Degei says, pointing to his bright, hand-woven turban, dark skirt and bright shirt.
“We used to only carry leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line and child mortality and literacy rates among the worst in Asia.
It is also the golden land of Indonesia.
The world’s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is just sixty miles from Paniai, a mountainous province roughly the size of New Jersey, home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua boasts forest reserves, the value of which is estimated at $ 78 billion.
These riches, however, entail one misfortune for the Papuans, ensuring that Indonesia’s powerful armed forces maintain their strangling presence here.
According to a 2005 New York Times investigation, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands for greater autonomy on the part of the Papuans threaten the existence of this golden vein and are ruthlessly suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by Indonesian military forces since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the massacres in the indigenous highlands of Papua in the 1970s can be considered genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We will lose everything,” a report published in 2016 by the Diocese of Brisbane, contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as summary executions, torture – particularly frequent, as claimed in another report, rape and electric shocks – and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week,” Andreas Harsono, a researcher in Indonesia, told Human Rights Watch.
Nuts tightened as Papua's resources attracted an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but demographics change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese shops, "varunga", sell fried chicken and a mixture of "gado-gado" vegetables served with peanut sauce.
The locals are trying to keep up with the competition.
“Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables cheaper in the traditional market than the indigenous people of Papua,” explains Abet Yow, a twenty-four-year-old native of Paniai who moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital, for work.
“Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua – the mother-mother (women) of Papua – have lost their market.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address inequality and rights abuses in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter enlisted the support of 27 of Papua’s 29 districts, including Paniai.
But in Papua, almost nothing has changed, and the locals feel betrayed.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Djokovic, expecting him to fulfill our hopes of restoring justice,” he said.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration of Djokovic, Paniai survived the tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols at a campfire in Enarotala when two Indonesian soldiers broke out of the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on the lights.
According to local pastor Javedt Tebay, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and after a while returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, soldiers who were drunk chased the children and beat them with rifle butts.
Then one of the soldiers shot at a group of children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Julianus Eimo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a nearby government election commission building, and the next day the situation escalated.
About 1,000 Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and performed the waita, a dance of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe: running in circles and depicting bird singing.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police station and military base.
When the situation escalated, soldiers on internal radio communication were ordered: “If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them,” as it was claimed in an official document seen by TIME magazine correspondents but not published in local media.
Fifty-six-year-old Jeremias Kayamé, the head of the Kego Koto district in Enarotala, felt the danger approaching and called for calm, appealing to the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I turned around, a bullet suddenly hit my left wrist,” he told TIME magazine, standing on the porch of his brightly colored wooden house.
Kayama still doesn’t know who fired the shot, but says the bullet came from the side of the line of the assembled soldiers.
“There was a crowd, there were a lot of shots,” he adds.
A local resident of Alfius, Youwa, was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
“I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” Johannes, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, told TIME.
“I saw that he was dead...I kissed him.”
General Yotje Mende, a senior police inspector in Papua, told reporters that his officers were only “defending” their base because it was under attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” said Papua Police Commissioner Pujo Sulistiyo in 2015.
“It’s a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more were injured.
The news of the killings did not reach Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing condolences to the families of the victims and vowing to address the issue of historic abuses of power in Papua.
“I want this situation to be resolved immediately so that it never happens again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Viranto said he would establish a non-judicial organization to end historic human rights violations.
But there were excuses almost immediately.
“Most of the violations happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the nineties or at the beginning of zero.
The fact is that we certainly want to address these violations, but there are procedures that need to be followed,” he said.
Wiranto then backed down, speaking to TIME magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, and said he had no plans to set up an organization to handle complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, “It will all be decided in court.”
Wiranto, who was accused by the United Nations of “crimes against humanity” in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people during a bloody vote for East Timor’s independence in 1999, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims of Paniai met such statements with grim mistrust.
“I’ve been questioned four times in the last three years, but there’s been absolutely no change,” Johannes says.
“I am tired.”
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
“I’m scared,” he says.
“I’m afraid of being arrested by the military, I’m afraid of being shot.”
His brother Jacobus also expressed the opinion that the inhabitants of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
“After we buried the bodies, the military came after me,” he says.
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in the nearby Paniai district of Deiai.
In a clash between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to help take an unconscious man to hospital, one person was killed and 17 others were injured, including children.
A man, twenty-four-year-old Ravianus Dove, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the office of the construction site owned by the company.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at the officers, who in response fired warning shots.
But locals claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) began shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
“We were in such a panic, we’re afraid of retaliation,” 29-year-old Domingu Badia, who lives near the hospital, told TIME magazine.
“I stayed at home for two days.”
The Deiai Parliament demanded that the officers involved in the incident be called to account and that the mobile police brigade be withdrawn from the region.
Paniai has always been a sore spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of significant development causes discontent of the Mei, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes scattered throughout the green-covered central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), an insurgent army that claims to defend the rights of Papuans by staging sporadic attacks and raids with kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM executives come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and unjustifiably detained by the military in recent years in Paniai under the pretext of “defending national independence”.
Some never came back.
Among the population of Papua Paniai is considered a “sad, forgotten place”.
Poverty increases discontent.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
Bread is not available to the same extent.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly, a note, as well as some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Usually they save most of the harvest for the family, and the rest is sold in the local market.
Ten note tubers cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has increased between indigenous Papuans and new migrants who arrived in large numbers following the introduction of new flights to Nabire Airport.
Few existing vacancies usually go to more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papuans rarely have enough money or the necessary skills to run their own competitive business.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village... because there’s no work, no money,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the eyes of the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on the work of international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basil Longchamp were deported from Papua for “insufficient coordination with relevant organizations” despite being given rare permits to conduct videotaping.
According to Felim Kine, deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch, promises made during the election campaign of Djokovic to lift restrictions on the work of the media in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
“Now, foreign journalists trying to report from the rebellious eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua face new dangers: visa denials and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
The lack of press attention means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to Papua’s immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific states — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands — asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “diverse and widespread violations” in Papua, including the Paniya shooting.
The same countries have supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arramanata Nasir dismissed the group's statement, telling reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia still has a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations."
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by Dutch Human Rights Ambassador Kiys Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence, pleading: “We want freedom,” according to a source who was also present at the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
Indonesia will hold a new presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Djokovic again.
“The Djokovics are a man with good intentions, but they’re surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting,” said Gobai, chairman of the tribe’s council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the inhabitants of Paniai, in addition to living in the shadow of the threat from the greedy army, are mired in poverty, and their education and health care are in poor condition.
Gobai says that the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, consider their vote for Jokowi to be a debt that he must pay.
“They don’t want money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: they buried the body of one of the victims on a plot of land directly opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice will probably never prevail, they will at least not let the guilty forget their crimes.
“They killed a member of our family,” Jacobus says, without raising his head.
“What else did we have to do?”
The fire for the second time covers the Dubai skyscraper “Torch”
A fire engulfed one of the world's tallest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to hastily leave the 70-story structure 337 meters high.
This is the second fire that swept through a high-rise building – which coincidentally is called “Torch” – in two years.
Evacuation was carried out in the building, no casualties were reported, and there was no operational news about the cause of the fire.
“We were asleep and woke up from the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor,” a resident of the skyscraper, named George, told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense Authority, fire crews extinguished the fire at around 4 a.m. local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working to provide shelter to the victims.
The incident could put the safety of materials used in the exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world back on the agenda.
In the course of the investigation by the Torch administration after the fire there in 2015, it turned out that the most affected by the cladding - external panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believed the insulation system and the cladding panels of the Grenfell Tower building in London could have accelerated the spread of a fire there in June that killed about 80 people.
The growth of tourist flow in Ida-Virumaa in June was minimal
As follows from the data that the correspondent of the portal rus.err.ee received in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017, a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists used the services of hotel enterprises of the North-East, which is 125 people or 0.6% more than in the same period a year earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists decreased, and foreign ones increased.
Thus, the foreign tourist flow increased in June by 7.3% (544 people) to 7994 tourists.
And the number of local tourists decreased by 3.2% from 12,944 to 12,525.
The most noticeable increase in the number of Russian tourists in the region was by 8.9% or 318 people compared to June 2016.
In total, in June 2017, 3885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed in Ida-Virumaa hotels.
Andrey Malakhov made it clear to fans who is to blame for his departure
Andrey Malakhov hinted to his fans on Instagram, who is to blame for his departure from the "First" channel.
So far, he has not commented on the rumors, but today posted a fragment of the article of the newspaper "Vedomosti" for August 1.
Photo Malakhov signed the tag "boss of the milkman".
An article on how to prevent the "burnout" of an employee and pay attention to his condition.
If we recall the numerous reports that the host could not find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who undertook to reformat "Let them talk", it becomes clear what he so transparently hinted at.
As reported, the TV presenter Andrey Malakhov is currently on vacation and did not sign an application for dismissal from the First channel.
The situation with dismissal may be clarified in the coming days.
In Afghanistan, the explosion of the car killed five soldiers
At least five servicemen were killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, RIA Novosti reports.
According to police, the night before near the military checkpoint in Girishk county, a car bomb exploded.
We know of 20 deaths.
On Friday morning in Girishka there was a new emergency.
Armed criminals attacked a currency exchange.
The fighting between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Diver filmed biting his camera shark
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal (Greg Skomal) captured on video the shark that bit his action camera GoPro.
The video was posted on Facebook by the U.S. Marine Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, of which Skomal is an employee.
The incident occurred on August 2 off the coast of the Cape Cod Peninsula in the north-east of the United States, the portal Necn.
A man during a dive tried to shoot a shark on a camera, which he kept on a special stick.
Seeing the man, the animal more than three meters long swam up to him.
The shark began to bite the camera, while not trying to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the predator acted in this way to determine whether the gadget is edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noted that such behavior of a marine animal turned out to be a novelty for scientists.
The cause of the mass brawl in the Ural military center became known
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District arrived at the Elan Training Center, where a mass brawl took place, to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this fight have already been known.
According to the public Mash, appeared on the page "VKontakte", the contract of the Ural military unit number 31612 fiercely fought over an unfilled bed.
It all began with the fact that a private named Sayan demonstratively ignored the order of the officer to fill up the protruding sheet.
On the side of the officer stood soldiers from the sixth company.
Sayana supported the first company.
In half an hour, 140 young men smashed beds and shells in the barracks, smashed windows.
More than 10 people were injured in the mass brawl.
The CIO denied the information about the stabbing.
The study found that at least one-fifth of passengers in the U.S. carry prohibited items on the plane.
The study found that more than 20 percent of air passengers knowingly or accidentally carried prohibited items in their luggage on board the plane through the U.S. Transportation Security Administration’s search points, including at least 6 percent who boarded the plane without being seen carrying prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Nearly 1 percent said they later found they had accidentally carried firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The study, conducted by charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and involving more than 1,000 people, also found that young passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to knowingly trying to fly with something banned by ATB, 19.7 percent were millennials compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
Consciously, ATB employees are most often carried by food and water.
More than 3 per cent admitted to having deliberately carried sharp objects, while 2.2 per cent of the female respondents and 3.7 per cent of the male respondents admitted knowingly carrying prohibited drugs onto the aircraft.
The company said it studied passengers across the country to find out how many of them were accidentally smuggled through airport searches and how many were doing so knowingly.
It is expected that most often – consciously or unconsciously – smugglers are the ones who fly the most.
As the company points out, the rules of ATB are quite complex and confusing.
People often do not know exactly what fluids they can carry and in what quantities.
Therefore, it is not surprising that most of what ATB selects are prohibited liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATB could be considered forbidden to carry books.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.
EPA Chief Pruitt Refuses to Delay Obama’s Emissions Reduction Rules
The day after the lawsuit filed by 15 states, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency reversed his decision to postpone the implementation of Obama’s rules designed to reduce emissions of air pollutants and lead to the formation of smog.
Pruitt explained his decision by the fact that now his agency more than under previous administrations, listens to the needs of environmental regulators of individual states.
He made no mention of the action brought against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeals.
The dispute revolved around the October 1 deadline by which states must ensure compliance with 2015 standards for ozone at ground level.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would defer compliance for one year to give his department more time to study the plan and avoid “inconsistency with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth.”
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma’s attorney general before he was appointed by President Trump, has long been known as a consistent opponent of tougher environmental regulations.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of norms that were opposed by the chemical or gas-oil industry.
An unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of the course taken by Puitt to return to the previous norms.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA chief had exceeded his authority in trying to delay the Obama administration’s enforcement of a rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that by dramatically changing course regarding ozone standards, he was simply fulfilling the EPA’s duty to cooperate with states in the comprehensive process of timely implementation of the new standards.
“Under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet deadlines, then waited for lawsuits from activist groups and others and discussed timelines in the course of settling the case,” said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
“We do not believe in regulation through trials, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously our charter and the power it gives us.”
However, the EPA said in a statement that Pruitt could at some point re-use his “deferral powers and other statutory powers” to ensure that the norms “jcyjdfys on a clear course and on all available information.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader review of the ozone rules.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on the issue.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states filing a lawsuit against the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
“The EPA’s change of course – following our lawsuits – is an important victory in the fight for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans, who are directly affected by the smog covering their cities,” Schneiderman said.
New York's lawsuit was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone occurs when ordinary pollutants from machinery, power plants, refineries, and chemical plants and other sources enter the atmosphere and react with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause severe respiratory problems in sensitive people, leading to thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health and environmental advocates welcomed Pruitt’s unexpected change of course.
“It’s sad to think about how much pressure it took to get this perfectly logical step from the person tasked with protecting the air we breathe,” said Laurie Ann Bird of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to resist the Trump administration’s ideological campaign to protect those who pollute the air and their special interests.”
The IAAF Congress extended the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation (WFLA).
Thus, Congress supported the IAAF Council on the Restoration of the WFLA, which issued a report on Monday in which it recommended that the suspension remain in force.
166 people voted for the extension of the suspension, against - 21, reports TASS.
The IAAF Board report stated that the WFLA has made significant progress in achieving the conditions set by the Membership Restoration Board, but these conditions have not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of the WFLA at the World Championships in London, Russian athletes were forced to perform under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people admitted to the IAAF championship.
The VFLA was indefinitely disqualified by the IAAF in 2015.
Then the report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound was published, which spoke about numerous violations of WADA regulations committed by Russian officials and athletes.
Read more about the latest report of the IAAF Council in the material "Kommersant" "IAAF extended sanctions against the VFLA."
Abominable defeat
As part of the 3rd round of the Russian Fonbet Championship among the teams of the PFL, Novomoskovsk "Khimik" held an away match against FC "Kaluga".
A little more than 10 days ago, the rivals played each other in the Cup of Russia, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
"Chemist" in no way inferior to the opponent, but the second relaxation in the outcome of the match led to an offensive goal and a fiasco.
After the recent defeat from the puddles with a score of 0:3, many in advance predicted an easy victory for the hosts.
However, from the beginning of the meeting, the Novomoskovets forced themselves to take into account and acted from the defense, but from a position of strength.
In the 1st half, the Kaluzhans built more and had an advantage in possession of the ball.
Another very high-quality match was played by Alexei Sirotin, who several times reflected the dangerous blows and his actions gave the partners confidence.
Unfortunately, in the attack, “Khimik” lacked the efforts and luck to put a dead end to the defense of “Kaluga” and score the first goal on the road.
After the break, the game began to take place on the counter odds.
The Novomoskovets played more actively in the attack.
Alarm bells for our team were errors in defense, which allowed the pool to create a number of sharp moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the meeting, the Chemist seized the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the Kaluga people played a role - they more competently and coolly held the end, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, the "Chemist" transferred the ball to the corner, the supply of which the owners of the field without resistance was transferred to the goal.
The author of the goal was Yuri Dubrovin.
In the reporting meeting, the “Khimik” demonstrated a good game, but suffered an insulting defeat.
Ahead of our team is another departure - on August 11 at 7 pm in Moscow at the stadium "Torpedo" named after Eduard Streltsov Novomoskovets will fight with the favorite of the group "Center" FC "Ararat", which includes Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmailov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come and support the Chemist!
The place and time of the meeting of Novomoskovets - 18.30 h. near the store "Magnolia" (Vostochnaya, 2 bld.
Composition "Chemist": Sirotin, Manokhin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Gogia (Oreshkin), Dudaiti, Ryzhov, Svyatov, Belyanin (Adoevtsev), Andreychenko (Lygin)

According to published transcripts of phone conversations, trump pressed Mexico about the payment of the wall at the border
The Washington Post published transcripts of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieta, Trump insisted that he stop publicly saying that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The U.S. president scolded him for publicly speaking out against the wall, and, according to leaked information, told him, “You can’t tell the press that.”
Trump began his campaign with a promise to build a wall along the U.S. southern border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
A leaked transcript of his first phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also revealed a heated altercation.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the U.S. should accept refugees going to Australia was “ridiculous,” “disgusting” and “dumb,” and insisted that because of the Obama administration’s agreement, he would look like an idiot because he intended to stop resettling refugees in the U.S.
Trump ended the conversation by telling Turnbull that “it was the most uncomfortable conversation of the day.”
Bodies of tourists killed in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to St. Petersburg
The plane, owned by the airline "Russia", on Board which are the bodies of the dead in Abkhazia, the Russians, took off at 20:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, reports TASS.
At the place of the final destination, the board will be met by employees of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the city hall, Deputy Minister of Resorts and Tourism of Abkhazia Astamyr Akhba told reporters.
Earlier, representatives of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Republic said that all the costs associated with the delivery of bodies back to Russia were borne by the government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhumi intends to pay the families of the victims compensation in the amount of 500 thousand rubles.
According to Akhba, the leadership of Abkhazia expressed readiness to pay for the relatives of the victims of the explosions of tourists, flights and accommodation in the republic, but the relatives sent to the republic only power of attorney for the right of local authorities to act in accordance with the established procedure.
On August 2, at about 16:20 Moscow time, in the village of Primorsky Gudautsky district in the warehouse of missile and artillery weapons of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic, two explosions thundered, after which large-caliber shells and other ammunition stored there began to detonate.
As a result, there was a fire in the warehouse, which provoked uncontrolled explosions of shells of various modifications.
As a result of the emergency killed two citizens of Russia - Elena Polyakova born in 1970 and Elena Timofeeva born in 1962, who were on vacation near the hydrogen sulfide source.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, with injuries of varying severity were taken to medical institutions of the republic.
Currently, seven people remain in the hospital, the rest are discharged.
The study of the Russian influence on the American elections will be a grand jury
Russia’s special prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington to examine Russia’s influence in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported.
A grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who gather evidence of potential criminal offenses and have the right to interrogate witnesses under oath.
The materials collected will be examined by the special prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient for prosecution.
The convening of a grand jury gives Mueller additional powers to collect testimony.
One of the topics of the investigation of the jury, which began work a few weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting of the son of the then presidential candidate Donald Trump with the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
To check the details of this meeting, held in June 2016, previously promised and Mueller.
They've already been studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. has expanded the staff of his lawyers.
Trump Jr. previously said that from a meeting with Veselnitskaya, he was waiting for dirt on the headquarters of the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, but no revealing documents were presented, and in the end it was about adoption.
In early August, a number of media reported that Trump Jr.’s statement about the meeting with Veselnitskaya was literally dictated by Trump Sr.
The White House clarified that the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority, which would have done any father.
Vice-Mayor of Penza detained at work
Deputy head of the administration of Penza Irina Shirshina was detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigative Committee at his workplace, RIA Novosti reported.
Official reports from law enforcement agencies on this matter has not yet been received, but the press service of the SC assured that they will soon follow.
The City of Penza has not yet commented on what happened.
Irina Shirshina is one of the five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
She oversaw urban planning and land relations, having held this position since April 2015.
Before that, she worked for a long time as the head of the department of the State Housing Construction Inspection in the Penza region.
Irina Shirshina is raising three minor children, it is noteworthy that once again becoming a mother a year ago, she refused maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there is no spaceport or launch vehicle in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space program.
And the installation of the bust of Yuri Gagarin is a tribute to the first person who visited space.
Unlike the monuments of the Soviet period, which are demolished in some countries, the monuments of Gagarin, on the contrary, "walk around the planet."
In 2012, the monument was erected in Houston, near the former headquarters of NASA.
In London, a monument on the territory of the Royal Observatory was erected in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first flight into space.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in the city of Erfut, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) escaped demolition in 1992 due to public protests and was moved from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of the 70th anniversary of Gagarin, a monument to Yurius Gagarins appeared in Riga.
This is how the name of the first cosmonaut sounds in Latvian, and it looks like he turned 70 years old.
Murder at Morse Ford: Activists Will Lose Lynch Courts on Stage to Call for Justice
The 1948 Ford Mercury drove past spectators in Monroe, Georgia, and roared toward the small Morse Ford Bridge.
When a car carrying four black passengers and a white driver approached the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked its path.
The main man - a middle-aged man in a suit in a thin strip - tightened his cigar and looked through the windshield.
Those inside trembled with fear.
"We need that nigger, Roger!" the man roared.
"Get him out of the car!"
The shrill screams broke the silence as a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which took place on July 22nd, is just a staging.
But when the neck of "Roger" was thrown a loop, almost all the audience really held their breath.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to the Morse Ford Bridge to re-lose the night when two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and May Murray Dorsey, were lynched by the puppeteers in 1946.
No one was convicted of these murders.
“It’s amazing that in all these years, no one has been arrested — even though we see them next to us; even though we know who they are,” says Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the production.
“It is a stain on our history and a stone on our souls.”
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgia congressman who has fought for human rights his entire life.
For him, the play is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
“We want an investigation, we want closure, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice,” he said.
“We can’t move on to healing and reconciliation until we get justice.”
The coroner covers the body of one of the lynching victims at Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI materials obtained by NBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of involvement in the lynching.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have been at large for decades, human rights activists say the city has always known two related lynching motives: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling first allowed black citizens to vote in the primaries, which were to take place that summer.
Approximately during the same election, according to the FBI, black executor Roger Malcolm stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, apparently because of a woman, in a fight.
Brooks says that Hester was rumored to have slept with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the child she was about to give birth to was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a major white landowner, paid $600 bail to free Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they drove out of the prison and drove up to the Morse Ford Bridge, a mob of vigilantes surrounded the car.
“It turns out that Harrison organized and commanded the killings,” the FBI said in a report.
“It’s also clear that there was collusion between state and city law enforcement who not only took part in the killings, but also destroyed the evidence and hid the identities of the witnesses.”
Brooks calls it short.
“It was an attack on the right to vote,” he said.
“They were all killed to send a message to black people in the city: if you sign up and vote, it will be the same for you.”
For almost a decade, Cassandra Green has directed an annual performance reproducing that lynching at Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is vivid, it captures the viewer and tells about the deep racism, which, as many would like to believe, is no longer in America.
It’s hard to watch and even harder to turn away, but Green believes that’s the main thing.
“We don’t want to talk about Lynch courts because they show us our own ugliness,” she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't hear me or hear what I've been through."
Rehearsals for this year’s play began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors – a dozen white, the rest black – gathered indoors and listened to the play’s review, which had been polished over the years.
Wade Marboe was the director along with Greene.
He played the role of the main member of the clan for several years, but says that the role has not become easier.
“I think I got dirty because he’s not the person I am,” Marboe says.
“But I think it’s very important to remember this story because we don’t want to go back to that time.”
In the room, the actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
The show begins with Malcolm, angry that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
Raskon screams in response.
It's a hit.
And at the same time, everyone (at least all black actors) is bursting with laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What is it?" asks Ascona.
He's worried and embarrassed.
Am I overreacting?
"No," Greene says through laughter.
“I just don’t think white people said ‘nigga’ back then.”
“Yes,” laughed one of the black men.
"You've got to get a solid 'r'."
And also the energy in the room changes: discomfort is replaced by a sense of companionship.
Everyone should do everything right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the sake of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Raskona says the word for the letter "n", it turns out clear and sharp.
No man laughs.
The show ends abruptly and quickly.
Screams, gunshots, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothes stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billy Holiday's sad song "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by the word.
A hundred yards from her, fifty spectators wipe tears and sweat from their eyes.
Among the spectators almost equal number of black and white.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York to see the show; many live very close by.
They endured Georgia’s heavy spirits for nearly eight hours as Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcolms and Dorsey.
Up to this point, the murders were just history, but now that they are standing in the same place where people were lynched, it seems that their ghosts are in the air right now.
When the last note of the song subsides, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
The children bend over to their heads, touch the paint depicting blood, and the still bodies and whisper something to each other.
“They’re not really dead,” murmurs one little boy, as if to remind himself.
After a few minutes, Green thanks the audience, and suddenly everything ends.
Actors drop ropes from their necks and wipe away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, a man in a suit who played the main puppeteer.
Nick Rascona hugs the other two actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional burden of the performance finally fell on him.
"It's all right," whispered one of the women.
“We know your heart is good.
You had a reason for that.”
Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta is busy discussing the play with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Daplinsky finds it difficult to find the words to describe how she feels after the performance.
“It’s hard to listen to these horrible, horrible words, and actions... of people who look like you and who do it because they look like you,” she says.
“After that, I think the lynchings are still happening,” she adds, “only now it’s called being shot by the police.”
In the other corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender, captured the general attention.
He says he's already started planning next year's show.
“The play excites us because it not only describes the horror of what we’ve been through, but also teaches us,” he says.
“Because if you don’t learn from this lesson, it could happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it.
The court fined Navalny for violations of the “agitation subbotnik”
The Simonovsky court of Moscow fined Alexei Navalny 300 thousand rubles for violation of the order of the rally.
The oppositionist was found guilty of committing an administrative offense under part 8 of Article 20.2 of the Administrative Code of the Russian Federation "Repeated violation of the order of organizing a rally".
Earlier, the judge of the Simonov court of Moscow, Khyzyr Mussakayev, finished considering the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the head of the staff of the oppositionist Alexei Navalny, who was prosecuted under the same article as Navalny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300 thousand rubles.
In this amount, Judge Mussakayev estimated the distribution of leaflets on the “agitation subbotnik”, which Navalny’s supporters held in Moscow on July 8-9.
After seeing the campaign materials, the police who followed the participants of the subbotnik believed that the organizers of the event deliberately concealed its true essence - a public action (for which it is necessary to ask permission from the capital authorities in advance).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazuev petitioned for the termination of administrative proceedings in connection with the absence of the composition of the offense and pointed out that the police made certain mistakes in the drafting of the protocol.
Volkov was not detained at the “agitation subbotnik” itself, but he received a subpoena obliging him to appear at the police station to tell about the event held with his active participation.
The same agenda was received by Navalny himself and another ally of the opposition - Nikolai Lyaskin.
In Mordovia, arrested the shooter of the bride and three guests of the wedding
A court in Mordovia has arrested a local resident who shot dead four people at a wedding, including a bride.
This was reported in the Republican Department of the Investigative Committee.
The incident occurred on the evening of July 29.
During the quarrel, a 42-year-old resident of Saransk shot several times at the guests of the event, who came to the rural pond to swim.
Three women and one man were injured.
A criminal case has been initiated under Article 213, paragraph 1 (a) (Hooliganism), Article 30, paragraph 3, and Article 105, paragraph 2 (A), (e), (and) (Attempted murder of two or more persons in a generally dangerous manner for hooligan motives).
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man opened fire due to the fact that the guests of the wedding, having decided to swim, passed through the territory of his plot to the reservoir.
The Ministry of Energy will tighten the requirements for suppliers of turbines for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for the provision of information by suppliers of critical equipment, in particular, turbines for power plants.
When launching gas turbines, hydroelectric power plants, oil pumping facilities and oil production facilities, equipment suppliers will be obliged to share data on access to it with the Ministry of Energy and the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control.
The draft Government resolution is ready and has been submitted for public discussion.
The new requirements will apply only to “critical energy equipment” supplied to Russia.
Potential threats in the document are such phenomena as obtaining information and access to the management of the object by foreign special services, criminal elements and structures, unscrupulous partners and hackers.
The European Union has expanded anti-Russian sanctions because of Siemens
The press service of the European Union on August 4 said that anti-Russian sanctions were expanded due to the scandal around the supply of Siemens turbines to the Crimea.
This was previously reported by "Arguments of the week".
The press service of the Council of the EU said that the sanctions against Russia were expanded due to the scandal with the Siemens turbines, which allegedly were delivered to the Crimea in circumvention of sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member states to expand anti-Russian sanctions.
Earlier it was reported that the final decision will be made before the end of the current day, and now the decision has been made, the sanctions against Russia have been expanded.
Pearson Cuts 3,000 More Jobs and Cuts Dividends to Bring Business Back to Life
On Friday, the British educational group Pearson announced that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and reduce the amount of pre-dividends by 72 percent in connection with the start of another restructuring program aimed at combating the problems faced by their business.
These job cuts, which, according to CEO John Fallon, will mostly occur in late 2018 and early 2019, occur in addition to the 4,000 jobs cut in the previous restructuring.
Pearson said it plans to cut an additional <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) in spending in May during its third cost-cutting programme to try to bring back to life a business hit by the rapid transition to digital learning.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann, said its forecasts for the year remained unchanged after it announced a 1 percent increase in core sales in the first half of the year to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: Nato soldier killed in suicide bombing
According to official sources, the suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded, according to a NATO statement.
According to unverified local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the incident in the city district of Karabakh.
The blast is the latest to hit Afghanistan this month, killing more than 30 people at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people outside the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the explosion, which occurred on Thursday evening, occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with the help of a “human-carrying improvised explosive device.”
According to the report, all the wounded are in stable condition and receive treatment in the American military hospital at the Bagram airfield.
The growing power of the Taliban and a group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to the UN, in the first half of 2017, at least 1,662 civilian casualties took place in Afghanistan, about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in the Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack.
On May 31, a powerful explosion in the city center killed more than 150 people - the most serious terrorist attack in the country since the United States-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence accentuates the precarious situation in Afghanistan, while U.S. President Donald Trump is assessing whether to increase the number of U.S. military forces providing assistance to troops and police in the country.
The terrorist attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its lines of conduct, and especially President Ashraf Ghani’s reputation.
Environmental Protection Agency cancels decision to postpone adoption of air pollution law after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has reversed a decision to delay passage of an Obama-era law that would require states to limit air pollution emissions a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called "Ozone Measurements - 2015", stressing that this step shows the agency's readiness to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue with and responsiveness to our partners in the states,” Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the Environmental Protection Agency’s intention to postpone ozone measurements, in which existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country, to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet stricter air quality standards, by one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly Democratic, along with the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit claiming the intent was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration is trying to roll back a wide range of environmental protection orders introduced by previous President Barack Obama as part of a broader program aimed, according to Trump, at brilliant economic growth.
But the move has drawn resistance from Democrats and environmental groups concerned about the potential impact of high emissions on public health.
According to the Environmental Protection Agency’s website, using ozone-containing air to breathe “may impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.
Association of European Businesses opposes new anti-Russian sanctions
The Association of European Businesses expressed its disagreement with the US economic sanctions against Russia.
According to the AEB, such measures can lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
The AEB statement said that business is one of the important links between countries and people, so you can not limit the principles of free trade.
European business unites more than 500 companies from the EU countries and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the heads of state and government of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would allow business to be separated from politics and to find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and harmony.
Deputies ask the police to restrict movement on the embankment in Pskov
The Pskov people’s deputies sent an appeal to the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the city Sergey Surin about the problem of movement along the embankment of the Great River.
Deputies of the Gordum Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Sidenkov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and relaxing in this place.
In their opinion, the control of drivers will help to make this area more calm and safe.
The problem is that the intruders ignore the signs “Walkway” and freely ride along the embankment.
It turns out that major repairs and improvement were carried out in vain.
Sports and children's playgrounds become uncomfortable because of cars.
As the Pskov Information Agency notes, in the evenings the central embankment is patrolled by employees of the PPS motor patrol and squad members.
Thanks to them, the number of passing cars becomes smaller, but the traffic does not stop completely.
Putin demanded that the investigative authorities not to remove hard disks
Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed to ban investigative bodies from removing servers and hard drives from work computers in enterprises.
The head of state said this at a meeting on investment programs for the development of the Far East.
According to the President, it is necessary to “exclude the use in the interests of the investigation of measures leading to the suspension of the activities of enterprises, including the removal of hard drives from work computers and servers.”
Putin noted that if the investigators have such a need, "it is enough to make copies, certify them and use them during the investigation."
The head of state added that "it is impossible to create conditions that prevent the continuation of the enterprise's activities up to the impossibility of paying taxes."

British actor Robert Hardy has died.
British actor Robert Hardy, who played Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge in the film adaptation of the Harry Potter series, died at the age of 92.
This was reported by the Independent newspaper on Thursday.
About the death of the actor told his relatives.
According to them, he lived a “huge life, having achieved success in film, theater and television for 70 years of his career.”
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltenham.
In 1959, on the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, he played with Laurence Olivier in The Tragedy of Coriolanus.
Hardy is also remembered for repeatedly performing the roles of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of the adaptations of Agatha Christie's works about Miss Marple.
For his performance as Churchill in the BBC television drama Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981), he was awarded the British Academy of Motion Picture and Television Arts (BAFTA).
Robert Hardy also had to play the role of US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt more than once.
Something rotten in the Danish state: Prince Henrik, but in fact Henri Marie Jean André, Count de Laborde, refused to be buried with his crowning wife, Queen Margrethe.
This year, the couple has a "golden" wedding, but the couple's agenda is not preparations for celebrations, but a funeral dispute.
His Highness refused the title of Prince-Consort, and he said to the Queen that she never regretted the title of King-Consort.
Henrik lives in France, although he remains officially the Queen's spouse.
Russian Foreign Ministry calls on Washington to stop shelling Moscow
The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted to the statements of Mike Pence, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The relevant statement was circulated by the foreign ministry some time ago.
In his comment, the Foreign Ministry pointed out that the United States is increasingly using cold war stamps that are inadequate to modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the US authorities to stop shelling the Russian Federation.
As “Arguments of the week” wrote on the eve, US Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and organizing a failed coup in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, there is a conversation about the possibility of a decisive match
Vasily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who appear to be steadily moving towards having the most exciting boxing match up to 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the offices of the ESPN channel in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the undefeated lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council, walked down the corridor to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization champion in the second half.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over former world champion in four weight categories, Erian Broner, on Saturday on Showtime, both boxers are among the top five boxers regardless of weight categories.
Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a held out his right hand and said, “How are you, champ?
Good luck to you.”
Lomachenko defends his belt in a duel with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at seven o’clock in the evening on the ESPN channel.
When the boxers posed for a photo, Lomachenko’s manager, Aegis Klimas, noted that a potential decisive battle between them would be just right.
“I used to be a semi-lightweight,” Garcia recalled.
“I went up to the category for Broner [up to 140 pounds], but I’m not that big.
I'm not much of a 140.
I want to go down to the half-light.
And he needs to go up to the semi-light [up to 135 pounds], and then we'll have a fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let’s give them that.”
Lomachenko agreed.
“Boxing needs this fight.”
Klimas asked if the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service, as part of a strategy he follows for Lomachenko to hold his 135-weight debut later this year to schedule a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next summer, who is also interested in battling the winner of their match between Jorge Linares and Lu.
“The fight can be on PPV because all the fans have asked for it,” Garcia said, later expressing his willingness to fight on the channel that will offer the best financial terms.
“We are the big names.
No other name would be of such interest.
As soon as they’re ready.”
Garcia said that he considers Lomachenko “a terrific boxer” and maybe will attend his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko did not immediately shower Garcia with praise and said that, in his opinion, the three-weight champion from Riverside looks "very slow, sorry, Mikey ... you asked for a knockout".
Garcia said he focused on showing the force of the punch, and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension build up before their own duel.
“This fight has to happen.
No other fight has aroused so much interest and conversation.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: “I was waiting for someone from the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
On several central streets of Moscow will block traffic for the weekend
This weekend, August 5 and 6, traffic will be restricted in the capital on the section of Tverskaya Street from Nastasyinsky Lane to Triumphal Square, as well as traffic on the 1st Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street.

At all sections, the overlap will operate on both lanes, the information center of the Moscow Department of Transport reports.
The streets will be closed from midnight on August 5 to 5 am on August 7 due to their improvement.
Also on the weekend will be closed traffic on the section of Moskvoretskaya embankment.
There continues the construction of the park "Zaryadye".
Putin instructed the Prosecutor General's office to check Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Russian Federation to conduct an inspection of the territory of Baikal for the facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
"I ask the Prosecutor General's Office to check the Baikal territory for facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities," Putin said at a meeting on environmental development of the region.
In addition, the Russian leader asked to take action if the facts of violations are revealed.
New test results published to assess the age of asylum seekers in Sweden
The latest results of tests of asylum seekers in Sweden, who were subjected to a new method of medical age assessment, show that more than 80 percent of those tested were assessed as over 18 years of age, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (R<0xC3><0xA4>ttsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age assessment in the asylum process more accurate, after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationverket) was criticized for failing to determine the true age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
So far, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of the subjects were assessed as being 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases, the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the subject was "likely to be 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was “probably less than 18.”
Tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is in doubt.
According to Johan G<0xC3><0xB6>ransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are in line with the results for the past months.
“We don’t see a big difference with the statistics over the past months, the numbers are quite consistent,” he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which people were assessed as having reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases, “the age of the test subject is likely to be 18 years or older.”
However, after reviewing 581 published results, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases a person openly stated that 18 he is performing this year.
The method of conducting a medical age assessment, which consists in making an x-ray of wisdom teeth and tomography of the knee joints and giving them for analysis to dentists and radiologists, has also caused criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institutet, Claude Marcus, whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people in order to determine whether they have gone through puberty earlier or later than usual.
“I had reasons to think about it, and I don’t think you need to use the measurement methods that are used now.
Biological age is thus determined very inaccurately.
If we can’t define it with certainty, we shouldn’t pretend we can,” he told the Metro newspaper.
However, G<0xC3><0xB6>ransen of the Forensic Medicine Agency spoke in favor of the accuracy of the tests: "In general, we can say that the risk of mistaken for an adult child is small.
The biggest risk we face is when a person is soon to be 18, in which case they are about 10 percent.”
I wonder if I should run for president.
During a working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin howled that he was ready to think about whether he would run for the post of President of Russia in the 2018 elections, Interfax reports.
This statement was a reaction to the request of the residents of the village of Cheremushki, Buryat region.
During a video conference devoted to the elimination of the fire in Buryatia and the Irkutsk region, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request to you: when the next presidential election will be, we ask all of you to run for this post again."
“Okay, I’ll think about it, thank you,” the president responded.
On July 28, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov commented on the statements of some media that the election headquarters of Vladimir Putin will be headed by the head of the presidential administration of the Russian Federation Anton Vaino.
Peskov called these assumptions “not based on anything, hypothetical reasoning.”
“While there are no headquarters, the establishment of headquarters is far, the election campaign is far,” — said Peskov.
“It’s not on the agenda yet,” Peskov said.
West Virginia Governor Says He's Moving to Another Party
West Virginia Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday during a rally with President Trump that he is moving to another party.
“Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have distanced themselves from me,” Governor Justice said.
“Today I say to you with many prayers and many thoughts...today I say to you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be of service to you as Governor-Democrat.”
The rally exploded with applause.
“So tomorrow I will change my registration to a Republican,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I would tell you it’s time to play differently.
Earlier, Trump promised that an important statement would be made at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia by a 42 percent margin, and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, as he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday night that “Governor Justice’s move to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is hindering rather than working to make our country great again.”
“Given only 15 governors and control over the smallest number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justice’s statement is just another rejection of a party that has no top-down leaders and is unable to find positive, unifying messages,” Republican National Committee spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement.
Cat-heavy named Mr. Beautiful found a home thanks to social networks
A Pittsboro, North Carolina, U.S. kennel has built a cat named Mr. Pretty Boy that weighs more than 14 pounds after he became famous thanks to the internet.
This is reported by Mashable.
At the end of June, a photo of the cat was posted on the kennel’s Facebook account with a request to find its owner, because “it was clearly fed by someone before”.
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the muzzle of the animal can become a new meme.
The publication has gained more than 3.2 thousand likes and 15 thousand comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed a desire to shelter Mr. Beautiful.
As a result, he was given into the hands of Angela Frazee (Angela Frazee), who promised to deal with his excess weight.
In an interview on WNCN radio, the American said that she had already had a similar experience: she took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms, and now he weighs a little more than five.
In July, Reddit users noticed a cat from Australia with unusually long paws.
The post with a photo of the animal collected more than 68 thousand views.

Coe praised the “sincere” apology of Russia in connection with the doping scandal
International track and field specialist Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he called Russia's sincere apologies for the doping scandal, but reiterated that now was not the right time to allow the country to compete in sports again.
Russian representative of the athletics Federation Dmitry Shlyakhtin said at the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations, which was held on the eve of the World Championships in athletics, that the suspension of his country from sports competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all athletes whose gold and silver medals were stolen from the competition.”
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations voted to maintain the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on found evidence of state-funded doping.
“It seemed to me that today’s response, today’s report, was very sincere,” Coe, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, told reporters.
“The whole council and the whole congress liked ... that the Russian Federation itself admits that it has been going through extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the federation.”
Coe said he also “liked” that Russia had agreed to the criteria for its recovery.
“I think it’s been a very constructive day and that we’re moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special committee that now is not the time to restore Russia’s rights,” Coe said.
“In the next few months, we must do everything to resolve this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the stained system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletics Federations will participate under a neutral flag in the World Championships in Athletics, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements have yet to be met to restore Russia.
As he told reporters in London after the report made at the Council of the International Association of Athletics Federations, drug testing is still not carried out in sufficient volume, and suspended coaches are still quietly doing their work.
The court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of treason
The detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) journalist Vasily Muravitsky was sent under arrest for two months, reports the SBU.
An employee of the online publication “Journal of Zhytomyr” is suspected of treason by placing his publications on Russian websites and in violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the actions of the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering it a “barbaric policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The patrol ship “Commandante Borsini” entered the territorial waters of Libya, then together with the Navy of this country to stop the influx of illegal migrants.
The decision to launch the operation was made by the Italian parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed it with the internationally recognized government of Libya, which, however, does not control most of the territory of the country.
The Libyan parliament, which opposes the cabinet and is based in Tobruk, accused Italy of violating Libya’s sovereignty.
The commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, gave orders to his subordinates to oppose the Italian ships.
In Rome, however, said that they do not believe these threats and intend to send in Libyan territorial waters another military ship.
The situation was discussed last week at talks between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the European-recognized Libyan cabinet, Faiz Sarraj.
Italian authorities have set up a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after statistics were released in July on the number of illegal immigrants arriving in the country from Libya: 95,000 people since the beginning of the year.
The government said that the resources for the reception of migrants have been exhausted.
A large-scale failure occurred in Skype
A global failure in the operation of the Skype service was recorded today in several countries of the world.
Users on Thursday, August 3, began to massively send complaints to the developers of the program.
Microsoft stressed that experts are already actively working to eliminate the problems faced by residents of Europe and North America, RIA Novosti reports.
Recall that in June of this year, Skype also failed.
Users have not been able to receive and send messages for some time.
Two leaders of the national team of Ukraine in athletics were suspended from participation in the World Cup
Olga Zemlyak and Olesya Povkh, specializing in short-distance running, are excluded from the national team of Ukraine for the 2017 world Cup in London.
This is reported on the website of the Federation of athletics of the country (FLAU).
This decision was made by the Executive Committee of the organization in connection with the initiation of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) disciplinary proceedings against athletes.
Zemlyak coach Sergey Basenko was also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportarena, the IAAF suspects the athletes in the use of doping.
Povh is the bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Championships, the European Champion 2010 in the 4 by 100 meter relay, Zemlyak is the winner of the 2012 European Championship in the 4 by 400 meter relay.
The World Championships in Athletics in London will be held from August 4 to 13.
How football’s financial rules will affect Neymar’s move to Paris
The rules, aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs, will not prevent the world record-setting transfer of Neymar from Spanish “Barcelona” to French “Paris Saint-Germain”.
Whatever the consequences may be further down the chain, for Paris Saint-Germain by UEFA, the governing body that controls European football, whose power it is to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament.
From the financial fair play rules introduced by UEFA in 2011, it follows that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar’s transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona were paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to release the Brazilian from the contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
PSG can certainly fork out to hire Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the team’s funding from Qatar’s energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums to acquire players, but they have to balance them at the expense of legitimate sources of income to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs that were in huge debt in their pursuit of success were in fact cheating and risking ruin in the event that banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, FFP ceased to focus on the debts of the clubs and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model initially used by Roman Abramovich at Chelsea in 2003 – buying a club with good potential and then spending heavily to improve the team and build a global brand – has become a difficult plan.
During this three-year evaluation period, which is exciting in 2018, clubs can incur losses of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
And despite Platini’s disgraceful removal from the presidency in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Aleksander Ceferin, is still determined to rein in excessive spending.
“Of course, FFP is alive and we are moving forward to tighten the rules,” Andrea Traverso, who controls FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will pay Neymar’s contract at one time, he can distribute this amount for reporting for the entire term of his contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in the annual report as a cost of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, severe sanctions were imposed on PSG, as well as on Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City.
PSG was fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million ($82 million at that rate), which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million, and was ordered to limit its Champions League squad during the 2014–15 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is tracking clubs that may try to outsmart its financial inspections by inflating their revenue at the expense of companies linked to the club’s owners.
Although the Qatari company could sponsor PSG, but if the amount of financing was considered to exceed standard market prices, UEFA would not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA ruled that the amount of PSG’s funding from the Qatar Tourism Authority was inflated.
It was reported that part of Neymar’s earnings at PSG could come in the form of payments from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar will become an ambassador for the World Cup, and such a maneuver could easily be detected by UEFA inspectors.
Past sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will be even more closely monitoring any attempts to circumvent the rules.
As reported on Thursday, people familiar with the situation, UEFA did not have preliminary discussions with PSG about the transfer of Neymar.
They spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss PSG’s position.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016, PSG received more than 10 million euros in profit with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects that Neymar’s arrival will be a favorable ground for sponsorship deals, the sale of paraphernalia and T-shirts with the team logo.
The club expects turnover to grow by at least 30 percent as a result of hiring a new player.
Undoubtedly angry that one of the best players is leaving, the Spanish league tried to interfere with the transfer of Neymar, saying that PSG would violate the financial fair play.
“This is an obvious case of financial doping, with the club and the state,” La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar as the ultimate owner of PSG.
Arsenal coach Ars<0xC3><0xA8>ne Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's doubts about the club's state funding.
“These are all consequences of equity participation, and it has completely changed the landscape of football over the last fifteen years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“When the club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to comply with financial fair play, because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The manner and place of taking the oath of office shall be determined by the President.
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation will be determined by the president - such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law were developed by the State Duma committee on legislation and state construction.
A week ago, the deputies planned to directly determine the procedure for taking the oath in the law.
From the solemn oath will be released children under 18 years, as well as incapacitated, follows from the amended text of the amendments to the bill "On Citizenship of the Russian Federation" (available "News"), which the Committee on July 11 will consider before the second reading at its meeting.
The idea of introducing the oath of citizenship of the Russian Federation instead of the formal signing of documents was supported by President Vladimir Putin on June 6 during a meeting with the speaker of the state Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The deputies formalized this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the bill providing for the abolition of the decision on the issuance of citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public calls for terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (part 2 of Article 205.2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), as well as for the theft of an aircraft, a train or a train.
According to the bill, its logic was as follows: when drawing up documents for citizenship, a person signs a promise to comply with Russian legislation - having taken the path of extremism, he violates this promise.
In April, the bill was submitted to the State Duma by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasilyev (“United Russia”), Gennady Zyuganov (KPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergei Mironov (“Fair Russia”) and the speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
On 19 May, the deputies adopted it in the first reading.
Last week, the State Duma Committee on State Construction and Legislation approved the text of the bill for the second reading, but now it has been revised again.
Now it says that the order of taking the oath will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law "On Citizenship of the Russian Federation", indicating that the ceremony should be held in a solemn atmosphere in front of the state emblem and flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event should take place - the list of places where the Russian coat of arms can be placed is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, cabinets of heads of state authorities of subjects, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, it could be the registry.
To make a solemn oath wishing to obtain citizenship of the Russian Federation will be after officials check their documents.
But a person will receive a Russian passport only after taking the oath, it follows from the revised text.
A week ago, the draft said that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text says that Russia will be sworn in at the age of 18, not at 14.
There is a rule that the oath will be exempt from incapacitated or limited incapacitated, as well as those who can not pronounce, read or personally sign the text of the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to release from this procedure and "other persons",
Also, the updated draft law prescribes a special procedure for admission to Russian citizens of residents of Ukraine, who are considered to be native speakers of the Russian language.
They will have to officially renounce their Ukrainian citizenship by submitting a corresponding application to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the application will need to be handed over to Russian officials.
Renunciation of “foreign” citizenship, as it is now, will not be required if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is impossible “for reasons beyond one’s control”.
The corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, including the first vice-speaker of the State Duma Ivan Melnikov (KPRF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Airat Farrakhov (all - "United Russia").
I think many of you know that getting a certificate from Ukraine is unrealistic, simply impossible.
Accordingly, a lot of people are waiting for the decision of their fate regarding the citizenship of the Russian Federation, - explained the head of the Duma Committee on state construction and legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov (EP).
In addition, the text clarifies that restrictions on the employment of certain positions for foreigners will not apply to those who refused in writing from "other" citizenship and handed over the former passport to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, but "for reasons beyond his control" he did not cease to be considered a citizen of another country.
Now foreigners are prohibited from holding positions in the municipal service, to be employed at facilities and in organizations whose activities are related to ensuring the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual citizenship or a residence permit of another country may not become a deputy of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force from September 1, 2017, by which time the necessary by-laws should be ready.
Nostalgia becomes a niche in "The Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
The current iteration of the story nostalgically recalls both the glorious days of the characters in the 80s; the grunge era in the 90s (about the time when the outstanding masters David Wayne and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV); and about herself - that is, about 2001 to the year, before her stars as Elisa Povett.
As a fact of culture, it is simultaneously the elevation and embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, it seems anachronistic.
“The First Day of Camp” was surprisingly good, and not just because of its absurdist humor (including the original story of a can of vegetables voiced by H. John Benjamin).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually preoccupied children who have just reached adulthood; thanks to this, the inability to return to the joke becomes part of the joke.
“Ten Years Later,” where adults have already played adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its parody is more haphazard and includes riffs from 90s stalker films like “Hands rocking the cradle.”
In one episode, the character takes out an Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates, and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
Many of the storylines are the same.
The good-natured Coop (Showalter), now a writer, has still not achieved reciprocity from Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn’t broken up with his virginity.
And then there’s the insane and despicable conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also Showalter), now instigated by George H.W. Bush (a tried-and-true parody by Michael Ian Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the retreat from it.
It’s especially funny to see the eternally young Rudd singing Matt Dillon’s song from Lonesome, whose character, former big man Andy, now looks like an old man.
The success of this franchise could be brought by random madness in the spirit of the recursive series “Seven Up”, until it reaches what, in my opinion, would be its logical conclusion: “Hot American summer: twenty years later”, where in the last scene the whole company would go to the cinema for the premiere of the film “Hot American summer”.
“Comrade Detective” on the Amazon turns to a different type of nostalgia: memories of the Cold War from “Americans,” “Blonde Blast,” or even “The Flash” with her images of the struggle between East and West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Reese Thomas, depicts a 1980s Romanian police drama about two policemen in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist path.
The main roles - who saw the life of Gregor and idealist Joseph - are performed by Florin Piersik Jr. and Corneliu Ulich, and their dialogues in English were voiced by Channing Tatum (he is also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But just an idea.
There are a few visual jokes (policemen spend time watching a chess match as Americans might watch football).
The team of famous voices behind the scenes - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - makes it interesting to play "guess the voice".
But "Comrade Detective" is so clinging to the plausibility of a clumsy propaganda drama - there's even a killer in a Ronald Reagan mask - that often looks like it.
Six long episodes are long, and it’s not funny very often.
If it were made shorter, Comrade Detective would be better able to handle his agitprop satire; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American embassy, there are two fat people sitting in the lobby devouring a bunch of hamburgers.
To an imaginary communist spectator, this image tells us that Western culture can make anything into a glutton.
Fictional Romanian filmmakers are not so wrong: We do so even with our own recent history, and with them too.
The prize fund of the match for the Russian Super Cup between Spartak and Lokomotiv will be about 30 million rubles.
This was announced by the President of the Russian Football Premier League (RFPL) Sergei Pryadkin at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, RT reports.
He also added that at the moment there are almost no tickets for the match.
The match "Spartak" - "Locomotive" will be held on Friday, July 14, at 21:30.
As TASS notes, Spartak is the current champion of the Russian Federation, and Lokomotiv is the owner of the Cup of the country.
Two young Ufa men cleaned a furniture shop for 200 thousand rubles
The other day, a 37-year-old Uffizi, who has a furniture company, turned to the police.
The man reported the theft of expensive tools from the shop, which caused serious damage to its production.
The production of thieves became tools with a total cost of almost 200 thousand rubles: two welding machines, a perforator, hydraulics, a winch.
The guards of the order began to search for the criminals and soon came out to the residents of the Blagoveshchensk district of Bashkortostan, friends of 23 and 24 years.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic, accomplices broke into the territory of the enterprise, broke into the front door and took out the tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment to the first car service that got caught.
A theft case has already been initiated against them, and law enforcement officers managed to return only a part of the stolen tools to the rightful owner.
State Department commented on Medvedev's words about relations between Russia and the United States
The United States and Russia should be able to work together.
This statement was made by the official representative of the state Department Heather Nauert in response to the words of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev about the relations between the two states.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government said that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States put an end to hope for the improvement of bilateral relations and declared a full-fledged trade war with Russia.
Commenting on these words, Nauert admitted that Russian-American relations are at a “low level”, but noted that it is necessary to look for “areas for interaction”.
“Look at the ceasefire in southwest Syria, which has been in place for almost a month.”
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," the diplomat told RIA Novosti.
At the same time, the representative of the foreign Ministry refused to comment on the statement of the Russian Prime Minister that sanctions are tantamount to a trade war.
US President Donald Trump signed a bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea on Wednesday.
However, he admitted that the document is unsuccessful and contrary to the US Constitution.
Dior "grown" roses from amethysts and quartz
The jewelry division of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - has replenished the collections of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
They have five new rings and three collars on velvet ribbons.
In the Rose Dior Pré Catelan line, two new rings and a pendant made of amethysts, rose quartz and diamonds made in the technique of gliptics (hand-carved stone) and paving and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house were released.
The head of the Dior Joaillerie, Victoire de Castellan, was inspired by the roses grown in his estate in Granville by the designer Christian Dior, and by the gardens of Bagatelle and Pre-Cathelan in Paris.
Trump found the culprits of the deterioration of relations with Russia
U.S. President Donald Trump has sharply criticized members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an unprecedentedly low and dangerous level.
“You can thank Congress, these same people can’t even give us medicine,” the president tweeted.
On the eve of Donald trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea.
They will, in particular, affect Russian banks and energy companies.
Subsequently, the White House issued a statement from the president, in which he indicated that the law will not allow the United States to conclude profitable deals and will bring Russia, China and North Korea even closer.
Belarusian entrepreneur refused to buy the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank
Entrepreneur from Belarus Viktor Prokopenia withdrew from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) the application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to RBC with the intention "to concentrate on other our planned investments and projects on which we are working."
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a step will be “the best investment of time”, despite the investment attractiveness of the purchase of Sberbank’s daughter.
Mr. Prokopenya became the main bidder for the purchase of a division of a Russian bank in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application of the consortium of NorvikBank Grigory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Gutseriev in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after President Petro Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One of these financial institutions - in addition to VTB and Vnesheconombank - became Sberbank.
Novak called the cause of blackout in the Crimea
The Ministry of energy of the Russian Federation called the cause of blackout in the Crimea.
The head of the department, Alexander Novak, made explanations about the incident.
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity due to a traffic accident on the territory of the Krasnodar Territory.
The truck hit the power line, as a result of which the Kuban and related Crimean networks were disconnected.
Power outages in major Crimean cities were recorded last week.
Specialists fixed the problem within a few hours.
Initially, it was reported that the cause of blackout could be an abnormal heat.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
It is expected that the Bank of England will later announce that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation caused rumors of a possible increase to subside.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain sluggish and left interest rates unchanged amid growing pressure on family incomes.
The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with a smaller number of committee members this month calling for a rate hike because weak economic growth weakened support for the hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank capped its forecasts at 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that pressure on family incomes would continue, while inflation is still expected to rise to around 3% in the fall.
However, the bank warned that rate hikes in the next few years would be necessary to control Brexit-induced inflation, and said borrowing costs would likely have to be raised more than expected in financial markets.
The committee also voted to abandon part of the huge package of economic development measures launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
Starting next February, the bank will close the emergency financing plan, under which it provides banks with cheap loans, although he said that now he will have to provide another 15 billion pounds under this plan - up to 115 billion pounds.
In the rate decision protocol, the bank said, “According to the MPC’s main projections, gross domestic product (GDP) growth is likely to remain slow in the near term, while pressure on real household incomes continues to affect consumption.”
On the subject of rates, he reiterated that in order to halt inflation, “some tightening of financial policy” would be required, at a “slightly larger” rate than markets expect.
At the moment, markets are predicting a first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases would be “gradual” and “limited.”
The bank’s forecasts for growth this year and next year are lower than those made in May, which were equal to 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank left its forecast unchanged at 1.8% in 2018.
After this news, sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was made after the recent disappointing growth figures weakened the increased expectation of an increase; GDP then grew by 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, growth, apparently, will remain at the level of 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank’s latest report on inflation gave little cause for rejoicing to households hit by high inflation and very small wage increases: according to the bank, the pressure will increase before declining.
The bank added that financial policy “cannot prevent” a good performance on earnings in the next few years, but expects wages to “significantly” recover by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set to grow as a result of growing demand for British goods, due to the low pound exchange rate, which compensates for some of the reduced consumer spending.
The decision came a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock results of the referendum on leaving the European Union, which caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully impact prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its final decision on rates, there was a growing buzz around the supposed rate hike, as inflation was increasingly pressing on the already heavily pressured households: three members of the specialist committee asked to raise rates to 0.5% in July.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6% from 2.9% in July, although the bank said the drop was expected and will be offset again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher figure compared to the planned 2% is entirely due to the low exchange rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Koreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent drop in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become even more competitive again as lenders demand business opportunities and look forward to a good year-end.
The market looks particularly favorable to those nearing the end of their existing contracts, as loan refinancing, often with the possibility of no commission and also at a low rate, becomes more popular than ever.
The state health service will prescribe a controversial drug for HIV 10000 people
Starting in September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” drug for HIV prevention after a battle in the High Court over funding for the drug from the Public Health Service.
The National Health Service of England has announced that Pre-Exposure HIV Prevention (PrEP), a pill taken before sex that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in people at risk by an average of 86 percent, will now be provided by the health service during the initial three-year trial period of approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to finance the trial after an appeals court upheld a High Court ruling last year that argued the National Health Service had the ability to pay for PrEP, despite her claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
The move, announced on Thursday, was called “the most important innovation” by the president of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) called it a “turning point”.
Before the full launch of the programme across England by April 2018, venereal dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start registering people, with even more dispensaries joining the programme in October.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PreEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When taking PrEP before sex, there are enough certain drugs in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients eligible for the drug include homosexual and bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV-positive and do not receive successful treatment.
The dispensaries will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals whose partners are not known whether their HIV status is being held back by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a GP in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venereological dispensary participating in the program.
The programme will cost <0xC2><0xA3>10m, and the NHS has signed a contract to supply the drug this week following an international procurement tender.
The study is structured in such a way as to assess all the possibilities of PrEP by collecting clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, on its digestibility and application on a large scale.
“This critical innovation should complement and strengthen the large-scale and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the greatest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of NAT (National AIDS Control Office), said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if correctly targeted at people in need and at risk, makes it possible to change the situation with the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at risk for HIV, thanks to this study conducted in England at the expense of the National Health Service, will have access to a new tool that opens up new opportunities, the use of which a person can control himself without discussing it with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “The first thing we need to do now is to make sure that the trial unfolds quickly across the country and that no one at risk for HIV is forgotten.
Now that we have the experimental drug PrEP, we are moving towards protecting more than 10,000 people at risk for HIV.”
Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: “We very much welcome the start of the PrEP trial, which was very late due to months of delays and delays on the part of the government.”
The data demonstrates how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the trial be rolled out across the country as soon as possible to protect people at risk for HIV and to move us one step further towards ending the spread of HIV in society.
World Congress of Tatars adopted a resolution on the support of the treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The Sixth Congress of the World Congress of Tatars (WCT) adopted a resolution in which it was noted the importance of maintaining the post of President in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is "a positively recommended form of organization of the highest state power in the republic and expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people."
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of the agreement on the delimitation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he "played a positive role in the ethno-cultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole."
Recall that the agreement between Moscow and Kazan, which has been in force since July 24, 2007, was concluded for 10 years.
On July 11, deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan appealed to the President of Russia with a request to extend the agreement and retain the title of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only subject of the federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called "president".
In Russia, there were difficulties in obtaining an international driver's license
The traffic police units are deficient in international driving licences (IDPs).
To obtain such rights, you have to wait a few weeks, which has become a real problem for vacationers who want to go on vacation abroad in their car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving licenses remains controversial.
The IDP was introduced to make it easier for foreign police to understand what is written in the national certificate, since the information in it is explained in five languages.
Requirements for international rights are recorded in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized and so on.
However, in fact, it all depends on the specific police or rental office: some require IDPs, and some enough national rights.
To insure themselves, drivers still receive international rights, but it should be borne in mind that in non-ratifying countries (for example, the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize either national rights or IDPs.
Now there is a problem with forms in almost all units of traffic police, reports "Kommersant", conducting a study in a number of regions.
So, in Moscow, in the units of UGIBDD coupons are simply not issued, forms are missing for four months.
You can make an appointment on the website of public services, but there the queue has already stretched until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to get an IDP "for technical reasons", without going into details, in the Samara region they honestly say that there are no forms, a similar situation is developing in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already faced the problem, such messages are increasingly appearing on social networks:
Irina Burmistrova: "Guess why it is impossible to obtain international rights in Moscow?"
That's right, because all the traffic police offices have run out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "Question to knowledgeable people!"
International law is urgently needed.
In Moscow, all the time hammered far ahead, on the spot coupons are not issued at all (there is a button, but the coupon can not give).
It would seem that the portal of public services shows that in the SPB free time is up to fig.
Has anyone tried it in another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for forms of international driving licenses have changed, therefore, new forms are being supplied to the units of the State Traffic Inspectorate.
This may be related to the deficit, however, it is unclear what changes we are talking about, this was not previously reported.
Blanks are purchased by the Center for Special Purposes in the Field of Road Safety (CSN BDD) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then delivered to the traffic police units.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with Goznak JSC: in 2014-2015, almost 200 thousand IDP forms were manufactured, in 2016 15 thousand forms were purchased, in 2017 - 90 thousand, but the last contract was concluded on July 18 with First Printing Yard LLC for the production of 70 thousand forms.
There is a version that CSN simply did not have time to conduct the tender in time, which is why the deficit arose.
However, there are other versions of the lack of forms: because of the crisis, many people began to travel independently not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand and so on.
What rights they accept there is not completely clear, so people are re-insured, and therefore there is an arousing demand for international “crotch”.
Recently it became known that professional drivers will have to pass an exam to confirm their qualifications.
This proposal was made by the Ministry of Transport.
The International Driving Permit (IDP) of the new model is valid from May 31, 2011.
The Minister of justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean bridge
Ukrainian Justice Minister Pavel Petrenko said he does not believe in Russia’s ability to build a bridge to Crimea.
About this on Friday, August 4, he said in an interview with the portal "Observer".
No self-respecting international company will even put a bolt or a nut there, because it risks losing its business in the EU, USA, Japan - in the countries that joined the sanctions against Russia over the Crimea.
“That is, in my deep belief, the prospects of this project actually do not exist,” Petrenko said.
He added that he believes Russia is unable to implement a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia can not normally build smaller facilities.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, entire stadiums have already begun to collapse.
“Therefore, I think the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that have been so short-sighted to join this project,” the official said.
On July 31, the builders completed the construction of the arch of the Crimean Bridge.
On the Kerch coast, a large-scale assembly of the Crimean Bridge road arch has been completed: its arch is closed at a height of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
"At the same time, the bridge builders have prepared a railway arch for installation on the fairway supports," the project information center said.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport Maxim Sokolov informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility is ahead of schedule.
The Crimean bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and the Krasnodar Territory.
In Spain fired an official who did not go to work for 10 years
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) was to be possessed by the chief of the Spanish official Carles Recio?
The permanent walk lasted for 10 long years.
Mr. Recio, however, was dismissed.
But not your immediate boss.
This is not the case in the world of bureaucrats.
Citizens, it seems, have long been accustomed to all the pranks of the "servants of the people".
And yet, officials still manage to surprise those on whose taxes they live well.
This time, the “sensation” came from Spain.
There, the employee of the archive of Valencia, Carles Recio, managed for ten years not to go to work.
He was regularly paid a salary.
And all solid - 50 thousand euros a year.
Mr. Recio's "wonderful times" are over.
He was dismissed by a decision of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia.
During the investigation, it turned out that the angry passerby every working morning came to the office at 07:00 to mark himself in the electronic system.
And he immediately went home.
Once again he appeared at the workplace at 16:00, to again note in the system that he had left.
It's been 10 years.
It also became known that all his free time was devoted to drawing comics at home.
Now the deputies of the legislative assembly of Valencia are thinking how to punish and the immediate boss of Mr. Recio, who could not help knowing how to "actively work" in his workplace his subordinate.
Judges should be protected from presidents.
The Presidential Council for Human Rights (HRC), on behalf of Vladimir Putin, has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HRC proposes to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts and to introduce their election.
For the courts of appeal and cassation instances, the HRC wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals within the framework of the presidential mandate.
The HRC has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work of the HRC was carried out on behalf of Vladimir Putin on January 3, 2017, which the president gave after a meeting with members of the council.
At the meeting with the council members on December 8, 2016, they discussed, among other things, individual cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as problems of public control in places of detention of citizens (see Kommersant of December 9, 2016).
The work of the HRC resulted in 25 proposals that address both the independence of judges and the identification of judicial errors, as well as the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin’s human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts to increase the independence of the other judges.
If the candidate for the position of judge successfully passed the competition and received the support of the judicial community, the chairman of the court, in the opinion of the HRC, must submit him for appointment, not having the right to refuse, as the law now allows.
It is also proposed to deprive the President of the right to distribute cases among judges.
To do this, experts admit, can specially written computer program.
The HRC also believes that the chairman has no right to “predetermine the results of the qualification certification of a judge, initiate his bringing to disciplinary responsibility, make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments”.
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to proceed to the “election of the presidents of the courts by the judges themselves” and “endow them with powers for a relatively short period with mandatory rotation.”
Now all the presidents of the courts (from republican to district) are appointed for six years by the president on the proposal of the chairman of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the HRC proposes to organize appeal and cassation in the courts of general jurisdiction in a new way.
Now their structure is tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The HRC says that "it is necessary to ensure the organization of individual courts of appeal and cassation not at the level of regional judicial bodies in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but in judicial districts."
Experts take as a basis the practice of arbitration courts.
There are “judicial districts” that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but guarantee greater independence from regional officials who find it difficult to use “telephone law”.
The HRC proposes to strengthen the people’s jurors in order to consider some “categories of civil and administrative cases” with their participation.
For example, about the deprivation of parental rights, about reinstatement at work, about the protection of honor and dignity, about the deprivation of driving licenses, etc.
"These are only our proposals," explained HRC member, retired Constitutional Court judge Tamara Morshchakova.
She also recalled that the president's instruction was not only to the HRC, but also to the Supreme Court (Supreme Court), which has not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still time for the execution of the order from the Armed Forces (among the co-executors - the Prosecutor General's Office and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation).
To report to Vladimir Putin on how effectively the independence of justice is ensured in the Russian Federation, the Chairman of the Armed Forces Vyacheslav Lebedev must before September 1.
Living the high life: semi-floor and clever design techniques have turned this small apartment in Earls Court into a spacious dwelling
Joan Lee, a former real estate banker, moved from a spacious home in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the ground floor of a cute Queen Anne-style typical house, and in favor of the new design says that Joan did not pack her things and did not move again.
“I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge on a much larger area,” says Joan.
“I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered her a price the same day.”
Since the first viewing, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
Initially, it was a one-bedroom apartment with a complex layout – to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add storage space and a half-story to squeeze the maximum benefit from the generous height of the ceilings.
“I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands,” she says.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi of the Notting Hill-based architectural and design studio Duck & Shed to use 12.5-foot-tall ceilings to create a home that would not only be a successful project, but fit Joan for life.
The ceiling was not high enough to accommodate two rooms one above the other, so the architectural task was to create a half-story where one could stand at full height.
Erfan had to think creatively to cope with the brief.
“Working with steel structures is very difficult,” he explains.
“We had to arrange the rooms so that they were one above the other, and did not have to bend.
It was necessary not just to build a simple platform, but to bend the structures so that they were at the right height and allowed to use the premises from above and below.”
This solution allowed Erfan to arrange two full-sized rooms one above the other in a separate space – and much more interesting.
From the half-floor through a vintage copper light window from <0xC2><0xAB>Retrouvius» opens a view of the chic living room below.
Mirror furniture with a golden finish, silver accents and vintage lighting devices from Serge Mui set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding spectacle, space and light.
The short corridor is framed by mirrors to make it appear longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored protective panel looks like a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirror cabinets are used to store all Joan's dishes.
To create the feeling of a more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can enclose the kitchen when it is not used.
There is nothing new in the kitchen.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it is a sliding up door, like in a garage.
“Engineering art was involved here,” Erfan says of the steel-reinforced wood-fiber panel door.
“It’s equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily.”
Thanks to the reasonable use of space and storage space, Joan received an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and improved layout.
“After all, floor space is exactly what you’re going to sell, that is, what your property is valued at,” Erfan says.
Roughly speaking, a real estate agent will come in and make calculations based on floor area.
Here they were able to increase the area of the floors using quality materials that give the space a touch of luxury.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help build an emotional connection with the home,” Erfan says.
“No one falls in love with electrical wiring in walls.
It’s important, but it doesn’t touch the strings of our hearts.”
This is evidence that due to good design and increased footage, an apartment can turn from something ordinary into something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you may decide to stay.
The Government approved the establishment of a Commission on Cultural Policy
The Russian government has approved the creation of a commission on state cultural policy.
The relevant decision was published on the Government website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policy.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, clarify tasks and prepare new programs for its implementation.
The head of the Commission appointed Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation.
The composition of the committee will be approved separately.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in 2016 approved a plan to implement the strategy of state cultural policy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and provides for measures to expand the influence of Russian culture in other countries, preserve the common cultural space and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to creating conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in the G20 fell to an eight-year low
Growth in consumer prices in the G20 countries fell to the lowest in the last eight years, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
According to OECD estimates, inflation in June 2016 was 2% - lower values were observed in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Earlier, Rosstat reported a decrease in the consumer price index in Russia by 0.1%.
Thus, the agency recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The inflation target in Russia, according to the calculations of the Ministry of Finance, is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economy, however, believes that the target value has already been achieved - according to this agency, the figure is 4%.
Putin warned against the illegal cutting of the Baikal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin during a meeting on the environmental development of the natural Baikal territory warned against the illegal destruction of forests.
During the event, Minister of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy noted that a bill had been prepared earlier.
It allows deforestation during firefighting, and the government plans to adopt it as early as autumn.
In turn, the President said that this project should be monitored so that in the process of cutting "everything is not cut down in a row."
Donskoy noted that this bill involves control by the Ministry of Emergency Situations and supervisory agencies.
Media: APU fighters secretly from the command agree with the militias of Donbass
Regular telephone service has been established on the line of armed confrontation in Donbass.
Fighters of the opposing sides constantly communicate with each other on mobile phones, and this communication is not known in the headquarters.
Militants of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and militias of Donbass established communication by cell phones in secret from their high command.
About it on August 4, reports "Strana.ua" with reference to the participants of the military operation in the Donbass.
According to the publication, the commanders of the units know the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily by phone.
Communication is not at all domestic: commanders are trying to reach some “tactical agreements”.
Often, according to the results of such conversations, a truce is concluded on a certain section of the front.
Journalists became aware of cases when a certain officer received congratulations on his birthday because of the front line, from his formal enemy.
AFU fighters and DPR and LPR militias have been sitting in the trenches on the demarcation line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine launched a combat operation against Donbass.
The foreign Ministry was outraged by the blocking of statements of the UN Security Council about the attacks on the Embassy of the Russian Federation
The Russian Foreign Ministry is outraged by the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives who block statements by the UN Security Council in the press condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The Ministry reminded that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on August 2 for the third time in a month was subjected to mortar fire by terrorists of the groups "Hayat Tahrir al-Sham" (former "Jabhat al-Nusra", banned in Russia) and "Faylaq Ar-Rahman".
Taking into account that the international community is unanimous in qualifying Nusra as a terrorist organization, and the UN Security Council resolutions call for counteracting this structure, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that "it would seem, of course, that the Nusra attacks should meet with universal unconditional and decisive condemnation, and there should be no ambiguity in the assessments of attacks against diplomatic missions."
However, for the third time in a month, diplomatic representatives of the United States, Great Britain, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council, alternately varying the tone of objections, hiding behind arguments about the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard brief draft statement of the Security Council to the press condemning terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission.
The reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us should remain on the conscience of those delegations.
“The most outrageous thing is that the failure of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to new provocations and terrorist attacks, gives them a sense of impunity,” the Foreign Ministry said, adding that “we would not want these barbarians to be convinced that someone in the Security Council is with them.”
Vladimir Putin called for limiting the number of unscheduled inspections of businesses
Russian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting on investment projects in the Far East said that the number of unscheduled inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the number of planned, and also said that it is necessary to limit the period of inspections to ten days.
"Unscheduled inspections are carried out, as a rule, without appropriate coordination with the prosecutor's office; only 2-3% are coordinated with the prosecutor's office, everything else goes independently," the president said.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be banned from seizing servers and hard drives in enterprises.
In addition, according to the President, business associations should get the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
"I hope that this will bring some positive to the consideration of cases related to entrepreneurial activity or related to the violation of the law in the field of entrepreneurship," the head of state said.
As reported by Kommersant, due to the moratorium on scheduled inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is growing.
In May, at the request of the business ombudsman under the President of Russia Boris Titov, a survey was conducted, as a result of which it turned out that in fact there was a substitution of scheduled inspections by unscheduled (the share of those who encountered them increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), prosecutorial (from 16.9% to 21.8%), administrative (from 7.9% to 13.3%), as well as inspections by citizens.

The brothers are fighting for a real estate empire worth more than $ 500 million
Two brothers fight for one of Victoria’s largest empires in real estate trading worth more than $500 million – forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin de Lutys lives in the Turak Palace through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a lawsuit against him in the Supreme Court for the division of property and assets.
Paul wants to get out of the family business in 2014, but the Supreme Court is still in a heated dispute about the terms of the divorce.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 87 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, bought since their family bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There the family founded the firm "Westco Jeans", which grew into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the De Lutys family’s list of possessions today includes office buildings, development sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and in Mount Buller, and shopping centers in the suburbs.
By arrangement with Colin's late father - whom Paul describes as the "main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutys family - he owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns about one-third.
According to the court, this means that the property of Colin is 316 million, and Paul - 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
“The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property,” he wrote in his first statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first hearings in the Supreme Court were held.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business - from which, according to Paul, Colin excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of some facilities.
In testimony given by Colin at the beginning of the trial, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
“My Italian roots make me consider family a top priority,” he wrote.
Court costs are growing like a snowball: hundreds of pages of testimony, emails, and reports from companies like Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Keck Cramer are involved in the case; both parties have attracted some of the best-known lawyers, including royal lawyer Allan Myers, and top-of-the-line suitors.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy; from the late 1950s they ran dairy bars and gourmets, and in the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, in which Colin opened the first family store of jeans.
Colin says he started Westco when he was “in the last grades of school and Paul was a boy (about 10 years old) at the time.”
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, had hoped to hand over their possessions to their sons without conflict.
“Luigi has often told me that he doesn’t want the brothers to go to court,” she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutys group of companies; Colin says that Mark received 10 million when he left the business, and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were “dissatisfied with the financial conditions of their branch.”
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the board of directors of the AFL club and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin replied only with a text message, which said that since the case had not yet been heard in court, "I really have nothing much to say."
“I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul has decided to file a lawsuit against me and bring our family’s name to justice,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a statement that he was trying to satisfy his brother’s demands.
“Our father wouldn’t want to see Paul and I argue in court,” he said, adding that he was still “hoping for a resolution of the conflict.”
On Friday, that hope seems to have dissipated.
“A decision on our case will be made soon by the court,” Colin wrote.
The new head of the Trump administration plans to limit the flow of information to the president.
Others tried to do so and were defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
In that case, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information coming to President Trump, including news reports from the media - hoping to keep the chief in a calmer state.
That's what reporter Josh Dowsey reports.
“At a meeting that the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, held with the White House leadership on his first day, he outlined a major problem in the White House under President Donald Trump that he hopes to solve: bad channels of information to the president.”
Kelly told staff that the information should go through him — in paper form or through briefings — because the president would be better off making decisions if he was getting the right information.
Kelly’s diagnosis is perfectly correct, but others have already failed in trying to pacify Trump by tracking the flow of information to him.
President Trump’s relationship with television began decades ago — and now that he’s in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
“When Trump, as a candidate, resented the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was helpful to demonstrate to him that he was getting fair coverage in publications that could be reconfirmed,” Sam Nanberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri wrote in Politico that “in the words of six former campaign staff members, in order to keep Trump’s Twitter habit under control, it was necessary to ensure that there was a constant stream of praise in the information coming to him personally.”
Oh, good.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit has ever been “under control” is ludicrous.
Maybe these campaign members know something we don’t, like that if it wasn’t for them, Trump’s tweets would have been even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets that Trump didn’t post.
If his employees saved him from trouble at least several times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has ever been able to keep Trump from pouring oil on the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by handing Trump material — reliable or not — that confirms their views.
Politico - just to this story - wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to constantly give the president dubious information.
Here is an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Trump’s current and former staffers say Trump can react very harshly to negative press reports, especially containing dangerous leaks, and will not rest until he finds out who was behind them.
That happened in late February, when someone planted a printout of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles K. Johnson, in which Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Welsh was accused of being “stands for a number of leaks” in the White House.
It doesn’t matter that Johnson is forever banned on Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he hasn’t presented specific facts, or that in the past he has launched false accusations and then dropped them.
Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Welsh.
Goldmacher adds that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Staff Secretary Rob Porter “tried to build a system to manage and document the flow of papers that Trump receives.”
How'd that work?
Three months later, Kelly tries to do the same.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his aides are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly’s task very difficult.
Tyumen Prosecutor's Office fights HIV-dissident
The prosecutor’s office challenged the decision of the Kalinin district court of Tyumen, which terminated the criminal case against a local resident whose young daughter died of HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died due to the fact that the mother is an HIV dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court absolved her of responsibility in connection with the reconciliation with the injured father.
The prosecutor’s office believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished, so as not to set a precedent for other HIV-dissidents.
The case against a resident of Tyumen was initiated under Part 1 of Article 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (causing death by negligence) in April - after her three-year-old daughter died of HIV infection stage 4B.
According to the prosecutor's office, the mother herself is HIV-positive.
"The woman did not treat herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that HIV infection does not exist," the prosecutor's office of the Tyumen region explained.
The criminal case was submitted to the Kalininsky District Court of Tyumen, which on July 25 decided to terminate it.
The petition was filed by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that "I have forgiven my wife, has no complaints to her, she made amends and apologized."
The prosecutor's office disagreed with the court's decision and appealed, demanding that the decision to dismiss the case be overturned and sent for reconsideration.
The girl died, and it is impossible to make amends for the harm caused by the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat it for a dangerous infection," the press service of the prosecutor's office said.
According to the supervisory authority, she should be punished, otherwise her example will be followed by other HIV-dissidents.
As told in the Tyumen AIDS Center, now in the Tyumen region about 12 children with HIV do not receive medical care because of the refusal of parents.
"And this situation has already improved - during the year of the work of the special group, half of the parents who categorically refused to treat children with HIV changed their opinion - they allowed to diagnose, began to take drugs," said Elena Loseva, a spokeswoman for the AIDS Center.
According to her, it is impossible to influence parents in a legislative way, and as a result, not all HIV-infected children can be detected - mothers do not allow them to be examined, hide, run away with children from hospitals.
The Dangers of HIV Dissidents
At the end of last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first study in Russia of the so-called movement of HIV-dissidents.
HIV-dissidents are people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Doctors and activists of AIDS-service NGOs call such views anti-medical, and in their dissemination they see a serious threat.
The terrible photo shoot, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, August 3, at the Grechany railway station in Khmelnitsky.
A merry company of drunken young people walked across the bridge over the railway tracks, where a freight train was just standing.
One of the friends had the idea to make a spectacular selfie on the roof of the car, reported "FACTS" in the communications sector of the police in the Khmelnytsky region.
The guy began to descend from the bridge on the train, but because of his indiscretion, he caught himself behind the power line and immediately received an electric shock.
Fortunately, this case became known to the station dispatcher, who immediately called an “emergency”.
Before the arrival of the doctors, the victim was moved to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the burn department of the Khmelnytsky regional clinical hospital.
The man was diagnosed with burns of the body 1-2 degrees.
Doctors are now assessing his condition as stable.
Law enforcers remind that in recent years, extreme selfies on the roofs of high-rise buildings, bridges, and moving vehicles have become increasingly popular.
The police urge people to be vigilant and not to allow such photo shoots, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have allowed the existence of oceans on ancient Venus
There could have been oceans on ancient Venus.
This was the assumption of French scientists.
Experts have created a computer model that demonstrated the process of water formation on the surface of planets, writes Science News.
It turned out that Venus at the beginning of its history formed oceans in which there was 10% more water than now on Earth.
Earlier, “Arguments of the week” wrote that, according to the hypothesis of scientists, the ocean 4 billion years ago could exist on Mars.
Foreign experts in the course of their research came to the conclusion that the water object was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people injured in San Francisco park shooting
In San Francisco, as a result of shooting wounded three people, reports the Associated Press.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park, where there were a significant number of visitors.
According to witnesses, several men who were on the bridge began to shout threats.
One of them took out a gun and started shooting at people.
The appearance of the attackers could not be considered, since they had everything closed except their eyes.
Another was given medical care, after which he was released.
The third injured person is a minor, there are no details about his condition.
Dolores Park is a popular spot for locals and tourists.
On July 1, at least 17 people were injured in a shooting at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several other visitors were injured while trying to leave the premises.
rock band Louna will present a new album in Barnaul
The concert of the rock band Louna will be held in Barnaul on October 17.
The musicians will present their new album “The Brave New World”, which became one of the most anticipated releases of the year.
The band is preparing a conceptual show that will be the brightest in the concert history of the band.
"Wonderful New World" is the fourth album by Russian rock band Louna.
Its name is associated with the well-known novel-antiutopia of O. Huxley "O wonderful new world".
The new songs do not retell the book, but tell about a society that lives by the law of dystopia, "blindly believing in propaganda and imposed values."
To raise money for the recording of the album, the group was helped by listeners: more than 1,200 people supported the project on the Planeta.ru website.
Louna released her first album, Make Louder!, in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians presented the album "Time X", and in 2013 recorded the album "We are Louna" (2013).
In the fall of 2015, Louna performed with a symphony orchestra in Crocus City Hall with the program "Songs of Peace".
As part of the group Lucine Gevorgyan (vocals), Vitaly Demidenko (bass guitar), Ruben Kazaryan (guitar), Sergey Ponkratiev (guitar), Leonid Kinzbursky (drums).
The concert will be held in the Barnaul club "Pharaoh" on October 17 at 19.00.
Ticket price: from 1200 to 2600 rubles.
Louna is one of the most popular bands on the Russian rock scene.
The team was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert took place in 2009.
The group won several times in different nominations of the hit parade "Devil's Dozen".
Gypsies overcame the moat and returned to the “street of millionaires”
Some of West Midland’s wealthiest homeowners are once again in conflict with the determined Roma who have overcome a moat dug by municipal authorities to retake the field near their homes.
The gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the rich Solihalla street, which was jokingly called the “street of millionaires”.
Bringing with them horses, infants, and a host of houses on wheels, they returned after they had been driven out no further than in May, and were not hindered by a moat dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasions.
This tactical company found a gap in the defensive structures and pushed their vehicles through the section, which was left unfenced to leave room for the path.
Angry residents attacked the municipality of Solihull, saying it had been "unable to solve this problem".
An anonymous local resident said: “They came here on Monday evening after being driven out of Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.”
The municipality should be shamed and forced to act, because they are completely incapable of solving this problem.
The gypsies were here in May, they were banished, and here they are again.
Last night, more gypsies came, and today, perhaps, more.
“Birmingham Municipality knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks,” she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don’t like that I keep paying the municipal tax, and the municipality can’t even put an end to it.”
One local resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “It’s funny, we just saw these gypsies leave the last time, and here, please, this attack continues.”
This time there were more of them, and we even saw a horse grazing in the meadow.”
A Solihull municipality spokesman said: “We are aware of an illegal camp on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and are cooperating with Solihull police; we are taking the necessary legal action to drive them out as soon as possible.”
To assist us in the collection of evidence, it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This allows us to form an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea shares the factory of champagne wines "Novy Svet"
The SUE of the Republic of Crimea "Champagne Wine Plant "Novy Svet" decided to share, transforming into OJSC "Champagne Wine Plant "Novy Svet", follows from the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anna Anyukhina.
100% of the shares of the enterprise will remain in the state ownership of the Crimea.
The authorized capital of the joint-stock company will be 595,5 million rubles and will consist of 5,955 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of 100 rubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of the Crimea stated that if within the next three years there are no funds for the modernization of the enterprise, then there will be a threat of stopping the plant.
The depreciation of fixed assets in the enterprise is about 60-70%.
For the modernization of the enterprise, 1.2 billion rubles are needed. Due to the peculiarities of the organizational and legal form, it is obliged to give 50% of the profit to the budget income.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"It is problematic to get money from the owner, it is difficult to talk about attracting borrowed funds from large credit institutions," Deputy Head of the Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea Sergey Petelin said in April this year.
The Crimean Parliament included the enterprise in the forecast privatization plan for 2017.
It was proposed to carry out its shareholding and put up for auction.
A source of "Interfax" in the authorities of the Crimea estimated the possible cost of the sale of the enterprise at $ 40 million, the investor's investment in modernization - another $ 30 million.
“New World” in 2016 increased the production of sparkling wines by 2.8% compared to the level of 2015 – up to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, Novy Svet planned to produce 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Lev Golitsyn as a factory for the production of sparkling wine in the New World estate he acquired.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Nizhny Novgorod third-graders smashed more than 40 tombstones
Employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Nizhny Novgorod region identified the citizens who destroyed 46 gravestones in the cemetery of the city of Lyskovo.
The attackers were third-grade students.
The first statement that the gravestones were damaged by unknown persons was received by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the Lyskovsky district on June 27.
In total, 24 people contacted the police about this.
As a result, a criminal case was initiated under Article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Destruction, damage or desecration of burial sites".
As a result of the investigation, the police identified the suspects, who turned out to be two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
Juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested to see how the monuments fall, and this prompted them to hooliganism.
Preventive measures have been taken with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening its tone with regard to NGO ships rescuing migrants.
Italy has warned the NGOs that own rescue vessels in the Mediterranean Sea that they will not be able to continue their work unless they comply with the new rules governing their activities.
“If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities,” Interior Minister Mario Minniti told the Turin daily Stampa.
Minniti’s warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a vessel belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion that its crew was actually cooperating with human traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has only worked for a year, declined to comment on the merits of the detailed charges brought against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
“For us, saving human life is and will remain a top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot now continue to operate in the search and rescue zone,” the organization said in a statement on social media.
“We will only be able to assess all the allegations made now after we have gathered all the information and will be able to assess the situation.”
Italian authorities have been monitoring the Juventa vessel, owned by Jugend Rettet, since October.
Its crew is suspected of taking on board migrants with whole lifeboats, which human traffickers sent directly to them, and allowing smugglers to leave with boats they could use again.
At least one such meeting is believed to have taken place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the indictment, which was published in Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the orders of the Italian coastal authorities, who control rescue operations in the area, more out of humanitarian zeal than for any other motives.
The Code of Conduct assumes mainly that Juventa vessels will have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code: Save the Children, the Maltese MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable provided they did not entail any “significant changes or disruption” to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti, meanwhile, said the sharp decline in recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicates that efforts to support the Libyan coastguard and co-operate with local mayors are bearing fruit.
“In recent days, we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel,” he said.
He announced plans for further negotiations with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
“In Libya, we don’t want to be associated with either side of the conflict.
The Russian authorities have recently significantly intensified their policy in the Libyan direction, and delegations of the warring Libyan parties have frequented their visits to Moscow.
The head of the Russian contact group on the intra-Libyan settlement at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma, assistant to the head of the Chechen Republic Lev Dengov told Kommersant what goals Moscow pursues in this region and on whom it bets.
Almost nothing is known about the Libya contact group you are leading.
Here, for example, the contact group on Ukraine - everyone knows about it.
And here's the veil of secrecy.
What exactly do you do, what goals do you pursue?
The contact group was established at the initiative of the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma.
Its activities are supervised by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (deputy of the Duma from Chechnya - "Kommersant").
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the speaker of the state Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The impetus for the creation of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker "Mekhanik Chebotarev" (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board. - "Kommersant").
We thought about how to help the crew.
Then a contact group of military specialists, representatives of the State Duma, was created, our work was supported by the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.
And how did it happen that you were the one who led it?
Since I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the work of the group.
Our activity was not limited to the release of sailors from the Chebotarev Mechanics.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all major groups opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - both from Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government headed by Faiz Sarraj is based. - "Kommersant"), and from Tobruk (the residence of the parliament that opposes the government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls the eastern regions of Libya. ".
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Vice Prime Minister of Libya - "Kommersant"), we were able to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
Then it was decided to use these contacts more effectively, to create a contact group.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I want to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to be associated with either side of the conflict, we are in dialogue with all.
How many people are in the contact group and how many are permanently in Libya?
There are currently five people in the contact group.
Among them there are people with experience in law enforcement agencies, including the Ministry of Defense.
We also want to include a group of specialists on the region, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
None of our employees are constantly in Libya, this is not necessary yet.
Are there now Russian military advisers, instructors in Libya?
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All the talk and publications about this are not true.
But your contact group includes former military personnel...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or cities closed to us until a certain point, such as Misrata (where militias are based, which played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and significantly intensified in subsequent years. - "Kommersant").
We arrived in Misrata in January of this year.
We were scared, they said that there were Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there ourselves, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why there are such rumors, what is the real role of Islamists there.
In Misrata, we met with all the representatives of the detachments that were engaged in the destruction of ISIS in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was recaptured from the militants of the Islamic State banned in Russia - "Kommersant").
We wanted to look at them, to meet these people, to check the information that they played a decisive role in the destruction of ISIS in Libya, and not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these merits to himself.
And what conclusion have you reached?
Did the Islamic State defeat Haftar in Libya?
He didn't do it.
Haftar conducted operations on the other front, in Benghazi.
And with ISIS in Sirte fought the structures that were subordinate to the government in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we invited to Russia people who conducted this anti-terrorist operation.
And they arrived - the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April this year, the Libyan delegation was received in the Federation Council, in the Duma, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Regardie.
You, as we understand, are in all Libyan regions and probably imagine the moods of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the ceasefire agreement on holding the elections that Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Sarraj reached in Paris at the end of July?
Or again, as has happened many times in the past, will agreements be broken, fighting resume, the parties will try to seize power alone?
For us, a good signal was the fact that Sarraj and Haftar agreed to another meeting, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, both leaders have been extremely negative about each other.
As for Russia's position...
They often write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe it.
We faced this situation when we were in Misrata, and it was on this day that Haftar climbed aboard the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov.
It was a coincidence.
But Misrata did not believe in coincidence.
We were told, “You must be very brave people to come to us today.”
But our task is precisely to show that we do not only support Haftar, we are in dialogue with all the key actors in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar have spoken.
Does understanding with Russian partners on a human, emotional level make it easier for him to study in the USSR twice?
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
He is Russian, if he knows it, it is very relative.
But the fact that he studied with us, of course, facilitates the dialogue with him.
Not just with him, by the way.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misrata, we meet generals who studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And they speak Russian very well.
And they are drawn to Russia, to some extent they feel nostalgia for it.
Do you consider it likely that the arms embargo on Libya will be lifted soon?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
They are interested, of course, but, as I have already said, we do not take sides in this conflict and do not want to arm some at the expense of others.
We want everyone to be in roughly equal positions.
As for the arms embargo, Libyans are constantly calling for Russia to somehow facilitate its lifting.
The process of drafting a constitution is now being actively promoted in Libya.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise solutions, achieve an internal consensus.
Then the elections should take place, which was also discussed at the meeting of Saraj and Haftar.
If the elections are held and the legitimate government is finally elected (and neither side has such status now), then it is possible to raise the issue of lifting the arms embargo in the UN Security Council.
Raising this issue now is pointless and dangerous, it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
Recently, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees sailing from Libya, feels abandoned by EU allies.
Can Moscow help Italian partners in this situation by using its ties with the Libyans?
How realistic is it, for example, that Haftar’s troops will establish control over the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers transporting immigrants to Europe?
A very timely question.
We are actively working on it.
The Italians need Russia’s support because Moscow is in dialogue with both Haftar and Sarraj, Misurata and the south of the country.
And in this matter, the tribes in southern Libya play a big role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it about the fact that the southerners cut off the flow of migrants on distant approaches?
That is, conditionally speaking, they turned back the buses in which Nigerian migrants go?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these flows going.
We hope to help bring the South together in the negotiation process between Sarraj, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But first, we would like to see the unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and Sarraj.
The head of the government in Tripoli, Faiz Sarraj, is considered an Islamist, a supporter of the introduction of Sharia norms in the country.
How radical is he?
Will this be an obstacle to building relations with Russia or the West?
I will give my personal opinion of him.
In my opinion, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But the Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country - moderately Islamic, open to the world.
They are also actively fighting terrorists.
Where did he get such a reputation?
It was created by those countries that are not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, where the legislative, executive and judicial powers are located.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other state structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in us not climbing there.
And we mixed all the cards for them and began to actively communicate with Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosneft has concluded a cooperation agreement with the state oil company of Libya - NOC.
NOC Director Mustafa Sanalla, with whom the head of Rosneft Igor Sechin concluded a deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft took place.
What will Russia do with it?
I think it's oversold.
What are Russia’s economic interests in Libya?
It is planned to re-sign the contracts concluded under Muammar Gaddafi.
These include, in particular, the previous agreements in the transport sector (construction of railways), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
Do Libyans have anything to pay?
Well, they have oil.
That is, as in the case of Iran, is it about the scheme "oil in exchange for services"?
I do not know what the scheme will be, I do not deal with these issues directly.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main thing.
We are essentially doing peacekeeping work there.
The main thing for us is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans to come to an agreement among themselves so that they can establish order and Libya will cease to be a favorable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task - to help the Libyan people and to drive out the terrorists.
Do you have data on the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to clarify this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that to date, no natives of Russia and other countries of the former USSR are there.
He said he had about 50,000 recordings of phone calls from Islamist and radical groups in Libya, and that there was no Russian language there.
Which countries are these fighters from?
I don’t want to go into those details.
Let’s formulate the question differently.
How many are the Libyans themselves among the Islamist militants in Libya?
There are almost no Libyans among them, they are no more than 5%.
The rest are newcomers.
Can Moscow hold intra-Libyan talks on the example of Paris?
There are such plans.
We are actively negotiating with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and declared their readiness to come to Moscow or Grozny.
When can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to tell now.
There are still several visits to be made, and then, I hope, there will be clarity about the time and place of negotiations.
In the Chekhov Museum, philanthropists raised money for an expensive gift to a sick boy
In the Moscow museum-reserve "Melikhovo", a nine-year-old boy Sasha Matsola, who has cerebral palsy, cerebral hydrocephalus and complete blindness, will receive a specialized treadmill as a gift on August 5.
A useful gift will be presented to Sasha by Oksana Kosareva, Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region, and Konstantin Bobkov, Director of the Museum.
The money for the simulator was collected during the charity marathon "Do not get tired of doing good", which was held in Melikhov on July 15 on Chekhov's Memorial Day.
On the eve of the marathon, the museum received a letter from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkino, Chekhov district: "I have no eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
“I would really like to get a treadmill as a gift, so that my legs become strong, and I would learn to walk a little bit.”
Sasha's dream has come true!
After the presentation in the museum-reserve there will be a "Concert-postscriptum" - a famous pianist, Honored Artist of Russia Alexander Gindin will perform popurri from popular classical works.
During the charity marathon in Melikhov, the choir of the Ascension Davydova Desert, bell-ringers of Ilya Drozdikhin’s workshop, students of the Moscow Conservatory named after P.I. Tchaikovsky and the Russian Gnessin Academy, artists of the Melikhov Theater “Chekhov Studio” performed.
Auctions were held for visitors, a book fair and a charity sale of souvenirs with the marathon logo were organized.
The museum-reserve "Melikhovo" took the initiative to make the Memorial Day of Chekhov on July 15 a single day of charity in all the museums of the Moscow region.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevsk, Zhytomyr region near the local football stadium shot several times in the direction of the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angered by the noise, told "FACTS" in the communication department of the police of the Zhytomyr region.
After that, the man went to a cafe nearby.
In the building, he had a conflict, during which a man used a device to shoot rubber bullets, injuring one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim was given the necessary medical care, there is no threat to his life.
Police and ambulance arrived at the scene, but by that time the shooter had disappeared.
Law enforcement officers established his identity and detained him on the same day, August 2.
The man could not explain his actions.
He has seized a device for shooting rubber bullets, which is sent for examination.
On this fact, criminal proceedings have been initiated under Art. 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The detainee faces imprisonment for a term of 3 to 7 years.
We will remind, in Kiev on Lukyanovka in the area of Tatarskaya Street on the night of July 28 there was an attack with shooting.
Michelle Carter Sentenced for Reporting on Conrad Roy's Suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for using text messages and phone calls to induce the suicide of her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will have to serve 15 months behind bars and another five years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said at Thursday’s hearing: “My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain at large until his appeal.
She was facing a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers said she and Roy both suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, listened to the verdict standing, clutching her hands and lowering her eyes.
“By her actions, she killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor told the court.
“She interrupted his life to improve hers.
“She did not accept responsibility,” she said.
"She showed no remorse."
But Carter’s lawyer said it was a “tragic case that she deeply regrets.”
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that, in his opinion, her "age, level of maturity or even mental illness did not significantly affect her actions."
The prosecutor read out a statement from Roy’s mother Lynn Roy, which said: “Not a single day has gone by that I have not mourned the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I handle it – I try to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will stay with us forever.”
Roy’s sister Camden Roy said she was haunted by the thought that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become the aunt of his children.
“Losing the person who has been with me since I was born is a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
The case is likely to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that would provide responsibility for advising a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in his car with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The incident caught the attention of the whole country when it became known that he was pushed to suicide by Carter's messages.
“You can hang yourself, jump off a roof, stab yourself with a knife I don’t know there are many ways,” she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death, while he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before her suicide, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad," and "You just have to turn on the light, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monis said that Carter wanted to get attention with Roy's death, and forbade her to communicate with the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
The views of the lawyers on this matter are divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British roommate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
The 30-year-old Knox published a separate opinion in the Los Angeles Times, which stated: “Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison.”
Evgeny Bogachev: "I let Langford go like a bird of high flight"
One of the best basketball players of the United League VTB 33-year-old Keith Langford left UNICS.
The departure of the American defender "Izvestia" commented on the President of UNICS Evgeny Bogachev.
Kit made this decision due to family circumstances, - said Evgeny Bogachev.
He has a young child, a wife who did not want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to meet him.
Of course, I could have said no and extended his contract, but he deserved a different attitude.
He played three seasons in UNICS and showed a high level in each match, giving 100%.
So I let him go like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and playing career.
Keith Langford played in the Kazan club for three years, winning the silver of the United League-2015/16.
In the 2016/17 season, he received the award for the most productive player of the Euroleague season.
He averaged 21.75 points per game.
This is the second time the award has been awarded since 2004.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in Euroleague history to win the award more than once.
In the near future, Langford will sign a contract with Chinese "Shenzhen", according to Eurohoops.
The American is expected to sign a 2-year contract worth $ 5 million.
Langford will be the second Euroleague star to enter the Chinese league in July.
Earlier in the Chinese CBA moved ex-center "Panatinaikos" Yannis Burusis.
Burnt in the sun tourist from the suburbs evacuated by helicopter in Adygea
Adyghe rescuers today by helicopter evacuated from the mountainous region of the republic near Moscow tourist who received severe sunburn.
The man was resting in the shelter "Fisht", located at an altitude of 1.6 thousand meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had high blood pressure and difficulty breathing.
A preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The rescuers were addressed by the head of the tour group, who said that the man received burns in the campaign.
Audi will have to modify up to 850,000 diesel cars
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The Chairman of BMW said that the company believes that “there are more intelligent ways than driving restrictions”, referring to European cities – including Munich, where BMW is located – which considered the possibility of banning or limiting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler said on Thursday it would modify three million Mercedes-Benz vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies called their move a recall.
European automakers have actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to promote compliance with carbon rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for car manufacturers to install equipment that neutralizes the exhaust gases of diesel cars is also increasing, and it is becoming difficult to maintain a competitive price for cars.
While German automakers are under scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government has also been accused of condescending to powerful automakers and ignoring signs of trouble.
Companies are trying not to repeat the mistakes of Volkswagen, which concealed the use of so-called “defeat devices”, which during testing could adjust the amount of harmful gases emitted so that it complies with the rules, and in normal driving conditions turned off.
In the United States, several Volkswagen executives have been indicted and the rest are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics department of the Audi engine development group was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi came under a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emissions rules and expanded an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could create serious problems for Volkswagen: the manufacturer of luxury cars is the source of a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s income.
In Astrakhan, the visitor of the cafe paid with fake money
The police received a message from an employee of the bank’s branch about the discovery of a suspicious banknote with a face value of 5,000 rubles when recalculating money received from the point of catering.
A study conducted at the Forensic Expert Center found that it is fake.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the Astrakhan region, one of the visitors of the cafe who bought shawarma paid with a banknote.
It is worth noting that the cash register was not equipped with a device for determining the authenticity of banknotes.
Currently, the police establish the persons involved in the manufacture and sale of a knowingly fake ticket of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs calls on residents of the Astrakhan region to be attentive when making financial transactions; employees of trade objects are recommended to install devices to verify the authenticity of the received funds.
Astronomers have found a “hell” planet on which even iron can melt
After studying the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b for the first time, astrophysicists were surprised by its temperature, which is able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts have noticed that water molecules are so heated by the light of a star that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble Space Telescope captured the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes water in the planet’s atmosphere to glow in the infrared.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "hot Jupiters" - gas giants, in size and mass comparable to the largest planet in the solar system, but located dozens of times closer to the parent star.
Because of this, the year on the exoplanet lasts only 1.3 "earth" days, and its gas shell is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and southern France, but now there are fears that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has grown worse due to arid weather and disease-carrying insects; this has caused constant headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shess, an expert at the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: “Lavender in Provence is really under threat, because in recent years this plant has been feeling the effects of climate change: much less rain in the spring and especially in the fall.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
And there are small cicadas, leaf-jumping insects carrying micro-bacteria; in very dry weather they become very abundant.”
A lot is at stake.
Lavender not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is very popular in perfumery and cosmetology.
Eric Sches says: “Instead of very long ears with a large number of large flowers, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or absent at all.
Therefore, we have fewer parts containing essential oil."
Solutions currently under consideration include improving water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding varieties more resistant to drought.
Ambassador of the Winter Universiade-2019 met with Krasnoyarsk schoolchildren
Two-time world champion in hockey, Ambassador of the Winter Universiade-2019 Alexander Semin met on the eve of the beginning of hockey players and gave autographs to the fans.
The meeting was held in the tent of the Winter Universiade-2019 as part of the thematic week dedicated to ice hockey.
Any visitor to the tent could skate on a platform with artificial ice.
In addition, relay races, quizzes and games were organized with the drawing of souvenir products of student games, a warm-up from the federation of aerobics.
Fifty students participated in the event.
Alexander Semin advised the kids to do as much as possible on the sports grounds and stressed that the most important thing at the initial stage of training is hard work and a huge desire to play hockey.
“It is great that in Krasnoyarsk there is such a platform as the tent of the Winter Universiade-2019, where novice athletes can directly ask questions to the coaches of the teams,” the champion said.
It should be noted that ambassadors of the Winter Universiade-2019 help to promote student sports and a healthy lifestyle among Krasnoyarsk residents.
The Universiade tent will work throughout the summer season until September 25, the press service of the Winter Universiade 2019 Directorate reports.
The State Department commented on Medvedev's words
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, commenting at a briefing on the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, said the need to find “areas for interaction” with Russia.
According to her, such areas should be found in order to "improve bilateral cooperation."
An example of such a successful cooperation Nauert called the ceasefire agreement on Syria.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
“And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other,” the diplomat said.
At the same time, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev’s claim of a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
“If Russia said that, then of course it has the right to say that, but I can’t say anything more about that,” a State Department spokeswoman said.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, the head of the Russian government Medvedev said that Washington declared a full-fledged trade war with Moscow, putting an end to hope for the improvement of bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said that U.S. sanctions will last for decades.
In addition, according to the Prime Minister, the American establishment “purely beat” Trump.
Bodybuilder who disappeared in the suburbs was found in someone else's country house who lost his memory
Bodybuilder Shamil Khanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25 under very spicy circumstances: he left the car to go to the toilet.
For seven days, he was unsuccessfully sought by acquaintances and local residents.
And Shamil was found in someone else's country house in Ramenskoe.
He was found naked by his owner in his bathroom.
The Dagestan athlete could not explain how he ended up here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name, and his passport was missing.
The announcement of his disappearance helped establish his identity.
Arrived on the outside of the doctors recorded Hanmetov partial memory loss and brain injury, according to the public Mash.
Perhaps the athlete is waiting for other surprises.
The attackers who abducted Shamil probably already visited his apartment, the keys of which were also stolen from him.
Oil and gas revenues in July exceeded the forecast by 7.4 billion rubles
In fact, the oil and gas revenues received in July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion rubles, according to the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excess, as the agency explains, was mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the US dollar to the ruble compared to the average monthly value of June used for the assessment, as well as due to the excess of the actual volume of gas production and the volume of exports of oil products of the projected levels.
"Deviation of oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly assessment in accordance with the Federal Law on the Federal Budget for 2017-2019, in August 2017 is projected at +40.2 billion rubles," the Ministry of Finance said.
Thus, the total amount of funds allocated for the purchase of foreign currency in the domestic currency market in the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017 is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of foreign currency purchases will be equivalent to 2.07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currency by the Ministry of Finance of Russia.
Each working day during the specified period, the Central Bank will conclude transactions for the purchase of foreign currency at organized auctions of the Moscow Exchange evenly during the trading day.
The acquired foreign currency will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury in the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist underscores that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
Employees of the Riodose weekly newspaper usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover the latest violent crimes in Sinaloa state involving organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing drug war.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told that they had to change their habits.
The two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking the children with them to an office where a grenade had already been thrown in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the board hanging in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column - no evidence is needed, suspicions and internal feelings will be enough.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being held by the government or the cartels, a whole list of scoundrels who make the work of covering the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
Violence is on the rise, and there are more and more journalists among the corpses that are multiplying in the country: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and this year at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the latter is their publisher and inspirer, co-founder of Riodose Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Valdés wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violent crimes.
His absence is felt very acutely, although his presence is ubiquitous – a large photograph of Valdez showing his middle finger, with the inscription “Justice” hanging on the facade of the Riodose building; two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts that depict his firmament or face.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their general trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, so far only two cases have been investigated, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of drug and organized crime-related murders committed each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Riodoza journalists insist they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, although they are heartbroken, although around now much more dangerous.
Without information about the killers, without justice from talking about safety at meetings, there is little benefit, says Ibarra.
“It’s very silly to waste time at this seminar,” he says.
“Until we know the cause, we suspect everyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left Riodose’s office in the state capital of Culiacan.
He managed to drive only a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper – which means “Twelfth River”.
The shooter drove away in his car and smashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two adult children.
Rumors usually spread quickly around Kuliakan.
But almost everyone is silent about Valdes.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the U.S. last January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlegrounds in the country as rival factions struggle to fill the vacuum.
Let’s not talk about the fact that one or more people are killed every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with decorated two-story mausoleums of drug kings, which are larger than the homes of many living people.
Let’s forget for a moment that the state of “calm” is simply when one of the cartels takes control of a coastal state with important ports and drug trafficking routes leading to the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorquez, the 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodose, is crushed by guilt for failing to protect a friend.
He thinks the murder was helped by two mistakes.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival factions of the cartel, which is at war with the sons of Guzman.
The publication may have angered the sons; the people who were supposed to be members of the gang bought all copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper that wrote about the same story was captured.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been out of danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroest, and in 2003, along with five colleagues, he founded Riodos, selling his $50 stock.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with drugs,” Bohorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation as a bold and honest publication, sales and advertising revenues grew.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted to the fact that in this publication they could read about what no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its founding, Riodose received the prestigious Maria Morse Cabo Award for her reporting work in Latin America.
That same year, Valdés won the International Press Freedom Prize for his courage in investigating Mexico’s drug trafficking, wherever it led.
He openly admitted that he was scared.
"I want to live on," he said at the CPJ award ceremony.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is “a way of life,” he said last October in an interview with Rompevianto TV.
“You have to accept the tasks that fall on you as a journalist – either that or you’re just fooling around.”
I don't want to be asked, "What were you doing when there were so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
Riodos staff miss Valdez, a joker who scolded like a port loader, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on the order they were in.
He always had to wear his hat.
He had to go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: did he lose his love for the once-established order?
His death also made them question their calculations of how best to do their job and stay alive.
“They don’t like it when you know their wives, their children, their legitimate business, and their underground drug-carrying airfields.
“These things were behind the line,” Bohorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from anything that smells bad.
The problem, says Riodose editor Andrés Villarreal, is that “the infatuation can be fooled... and then what happened to Javier happens.”
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa — as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states, where there is a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak government institutions, and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodos employees gathered for security training, suddenly it was forbidden to bring cell phones: a few days before it became known that spy programs that are sold exclusively to governments are used in Mexico to spy on journalists and public activists.
Outside, two police officers are sheltering in the shade of a tree from 104 degrees of heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were tasked by the state government to guard the Riodos office, which is located in a four-story building in the bourgeois quarter of Culiacan.
Some journalists half-jokingly asked if these police officers were among the 50 percent of law enforcement officers that the governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area that is de facto controlled by drug gangs.
In the next issue of "Riodos" counted on three main topics.
This is the murder in Sinaloa of the brother of former boxing champion Julio Cesar Chávez.
They also had exposure of government spending concentrated in the governor’s hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping at one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the D.A.'s office.
Officially, it was not announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it came time to write about what everyone in the city knew: that it was a favorite restaurant of both drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of government for almost the past century.
Recently, several governors from PRI have been accused of corruption.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about previous incidents at the restaurant, including when El Chapo’s son Guzman slipped away from a military raid.
A few months ago, readers would have been looking for a Valdez column with the most reliable information about the abduction.
“We would have known what happened before,” said Villareal, 46, nicknamed “El Flaco” for his lean physique.
"Today, all communication channels with our sources have been severed."
Valdez’s office is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers protesting the killings of journalists, because employees have become what they never thought they would become: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went the next morning to a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office dedicated to another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
They found the burned body, and authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Across the country, journalists began to speak up, organize protests and write “SOS Press” on the sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorquez was in Washington, D.C., trying to enlist international support in demanding justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with Sinaloa’s governor the day after Valdés’ murder, Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez accused authorities of spying on journalists and ordering them to be killed for telling the truth.
After that, she asked not to give her more tasks to cover the activities of the government, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdés has said many times that journalists in Mexico are “surrounded” by organized crime, its accomplices in government, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Drug Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not just killed by gangs of drug traffickers; they are killed by politicians and security services colluded with organized crime.
The Article 19 Press Protection Committee believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out on the orders of police and government officials.
“In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up,” Ramirez says.
Of course, killing scares people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
On her body was found a note supposedly written on behalf of the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my articles."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some newspapers chose to close like the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after its correspondent Miroslava Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to hold out like El Manyana from Nuevo Laredo after its leader was assassinated in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juárez publicly addressed the drug cartels through an editorial on the front page entitled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have left their home states or the country in general.
This is a painful decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find work, and they continue to look for danger on the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as apparently happened with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who stay and continue to work, daily balance between risky decisions.
Ibarra — who once dreamed of being a poet — admits he’s scared to write about the drug trade.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I became a journalist,” he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the latest issue was ready for print, Riodos publishers were sitting on the sidewalk near the office drinking beer when their phones rang simultaneously.
A series of shootings between rival gangs and security forces near the resort city of Masatlan left behind, according to confirmed reports, 19 corpses.
The war continued to flare up, as promised in a series of messages from cartels discovered in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted the news on the Riodos website via their mobile phone.
The next day I had to re-write the first page.
There were sirens in the vicinity - another firefight in the vicinity.
Bohorkes looked to see if the policemen guarding them were ready to defend themselves.
If they were scared, they didn’t show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was exposed to the whole of Sinaloa, Riodos employees continued his work.
"How can you think of closing," Bohorquez said, "if on the very day Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send her out to report?"
The dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
The researchers said that the first remains of an incredible rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner were so well preserved that experts called it the “Mona Lisa among dinosaurs.”
It was so well preserved that they were even able to determine that the color of his scaly skin was reddish-brown—and to say that he had, in some way, a “dark past.”
In a report published in the journal Modern Biology, it was described as “the best-preserved of the Thyrophorus in the history of the finds and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.”
This fossil is a newly found specimen of a nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredible good condition has stunned researchers who call it “really remarkable.”
This herbivorous thyrophorus is the best-preserved fossil of its kind in the history of the finds, according to articles in the National Geographic journal.
It was found by Sean Funk while he was working at Sankor's Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He came across something that seemed different from the surrounding breed, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years, work was carried out to find an animal inside an earthen block weighing 2,500 feet (1,100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work is done, the finished result can be demonstrated.
“It only takes a little squinting, and you can almost believe he’s asleep,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a research fellow at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum, which showcases the creation.
He will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved specimens of dinosaurs – the Mona Lisa among dinosaurs.
Studying its skin, the researchers found that it was herbivorous, despite being covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, apparently exposed to significant danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerfully shelled dinosaur used red-and-white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as protective coloring, which is also used by many animals today.
This would allow it to merge more quickly with the environment and avoid encountering enemies, experts say, suggesting that larger dinosaurs hunted it.
This 110-million-year-old creature, belonging to the nodosaur family, was widely covered in print in May, and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of museum laboratory assistant Mark Mitchell, one of the members of the group, who spent more than 7,000 hours behind his painstaking excavation.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international group of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor plates on his body.
They found a protective coloration, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although the protective coloration is well-spread, the discovery came as a surprise because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is significantly larger than the size of living animals with protective coloration.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred to mask confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern animals with a protective coloring - for example, deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and are more affordable prey, which indicates that nodosaurs had to seriously fight for survival.
“The serious threat posed by predators to a massive, heavily shelled dinosaur shows just how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the Cretaceous period were,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in the dinosaur scales also suggests that its skin was supposed to be reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about its life, including the preserved contents of its digestive tract, to find out what it ate during its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was carried away into the sea, where it sank and with its back went down to the bottom of the ocean.
Back then, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans likely extended much further inland than they do now.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, and at the same time completely preserved in three dimensions, preserving the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it did then, in the Early Cretaceous period.
You don’t have to use your imagination to recreate it, you just have to look a little bit more closely, and you can almost believe that he’s asleep.”
The Cretaceous period is the era when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of these, the Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than the Borealopelta, a thyrophore could have been hunted by one of its formidable ancestors.
These include the acrocanthosaur, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long monster weighing six tons.
Scientists, whose latest discoveries are published in the journal Modern Biology, believe that Borealopelta was taken to the sea after death and mummified in silt.
The creature was found by Sean Funk while he was working at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum staff, it is the best-preserved thyrophore in the world, along with skin and armor, and it is intact, from the snout to the femur.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
Their characteristic feature was two twenty-inch spikes protruding from the shoulders.
The researchers believe that this herbivorous thyrophorus was heavily treading on what is now Canada until a spilled river carried it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur’s underwater burial preserved its shell with precision down to the smallest detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover the bumpy shell plates along the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Error wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, such a degree of safety is “rare as winning the lottery.”
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
Fossilized remains of the skin still cover the bumpy shell plates, sowing the skull of the animal.
His right foreleg is extended along the side, five fingers on it are turned upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole.”
Mikheil Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikheil Saakashvili, who previously headed Georgia and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
At the same time, he did so without documents confirming his identity and citizenship.
About the arrival of Saakashvili reports the Polish edition of Telewizja Republika, which posted on his YouTube channel a video with his speech.
Saakashvili spoke at an event to commemorate the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising against Hitler’s troops in 1944.
Since the politician does not know Polish, although he tried to start a speech in this language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician touched upon the topic of Georgia’s cooperation with Poland, and also spoke about Ukraine.
The fact that the migration service of Ukraine deprived him of citizenship, the disgraced politician learned while in the United States.
How exactly he managed to make a transatlantic flight without documents is still unknown.
Earlier, the former governor of the Odessa region Mikhail Saakashvili said that his signature on the application for citizenship of Ukraine was forged.
The politician stressed that he did not fill out any questionnaires.
The investigation in the case of Weinziger and Olkhovik has been extended until January
The term of the preliminary investigation into the case of the co-owner of the Renova group of companies Yevgeny Olkhovik and the head of the T Plus energy holding company Boris Weinzicher has been extended until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basmanny court is considering the extension of the defendant's house arrest.
The representative of the UK at the meeting announced the decision to extend the preliminary investigation for the last time.
"The special complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to seize and conduct an examination of a large number of documents, as well as investigative actions on the territory of several subjects of the Russian Federation," the investigator said.
He added that the suspects regularly gave bribes to the leadership of Komi.
Their total size is estimated at not less than a billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Weinzicher, Olkhovik, as well as the former head of CJSC "Comprehensive Energy Systems" Mikhail Slobodin, who until September 5 headed the company "Vimpelkom", handed over to the highest officials of the Komi Republic bribes for the establishment of the most favorable tariffs for thermal and electricity, as well as for creating favorable conditions for business.
Weinziger and Olkhovik were detained, transferred to Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin fled from the investigation and was put on the federal wanted list.
How did one activist find out the answer to the question “Whose streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after arriving in New York as part of a tourist trip, a St. Louis native was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, looking at a Facebook feed on her phone.
She ran into someone from high school.
It read: “Police have just killed an eighteen-year-old child and he is still lying in the middle of the street.”
Noting that no one else in her feed had posted this information, she was puzzled and closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
There were a lot of reposts in her feed with the name <0x40>TheePharoah.
A rapper from Greater St. Louis tweeted about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old boy killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown’s lifeless body, spread out in the middle of the street, where it would remain for four hours.
“It’s wild,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her circle.
She put the phone down, and later in the evening came back to tweets that people were going to Canfield Drive.
There were pictures of a signal tape and screaming people and a man claiming to be Brown’s father holding up a poster saying, “A Ferguson police officer just killed my unarmed son!”
She watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another police officer, she said, pulled the trigger of a rifle and yelled, “I’m going to kill you all... animals!”
“It’s a non-standard situation,” Ferrell said at the time, according to her own recollections.
“This is not a murder like the ones we are used to and can call typical.
At that moment I felt a chill.
I was angry and crying.”
She took a return flight and flew home the next day.
Landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary, Whose Streets?, which will be released on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience from the point of view of the people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrell was driving to Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a flower dress and a wreath of flowers, they recalled the conversation they had had up to this morning, countless times, "about the experience of black people and their situation."
She recalls saying, “Remember when I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We’re going to Ferguson now because an 18-year-old boy was killed by a police officer, and that was wrong.”
“I couldn’t help but take her,” Ferrell later said.
“What is happening today is the culmination of what has happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it, and be raised on it.
She must not only be well versed in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of black experience and their situations, and what we must do to become free in order to be free.
Even if I manage to provide her with an environment in which she does not personally face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would do her a disservice if I fenced her off.”
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made their first stop at South Florissant Road, a site across the street from a police station that had become something of a tent camp, while activists waited for reports of Officer Darren Wilson’s final non-accusation.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined a local entrepreneur who prepared lunch packages.
They collected packages and helped distribute them to the protesters.
Little by little, Ferrell took the form of a new type of activism.
“My activism changed completely after August 9th,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Association of Health Students, National Minorities, and engaged in food justice and health inequalities among black communities.
“I had no experience as an organizer.
It came by itself.”
A few weeks later, at an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaa Folayan, one of her co-directors.
Folayan said she and her chief cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Ferrar, "just wanted to document" the events.
Ferrell came up with the question: “Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story to play?”
This skepticism was inspired by numerous people, often white, who came to the community to benefit from its pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, “We heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson were not getting the spotlight, and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already teamed up with her co-director, Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on death row.
His involvement aroused sympathy for the project among Ferrell and six other locals, with whom the project's "Whose Streets?" team kept in touch during the years following Brown's murder.
“In this documentary, no one speaks for us or with us, we speak for ourselves,” Davis said.
“It was the most important thing for me how these people would be represented, because that’s how I would be represented myself.”
Although the goal of the project was not to focus on Ferrell’s experience at all – in an effort to show that the movement “is not about the leader-savior, but about how the community unites”, as Folayan said – it turned out to be the most open of the participants in the film.
As a result, Whose Streets? shows unexpectedly personal aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
“I felt naked,” Ferrell said, laughing at how she first saw the finished product.
“But I realized that when you do that kind of work and you humanize black people, there has to be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrell’s story again discusses and highlights the role of the black homosexual woman in the broader context of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement – those who created the #BlackLivesMatter tag on social media after the murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 – consider themselves homosexuals.
“Black gay women in leadership positions support this whole movement,” Ferrell says, “and that’s because we’re constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black gay women have to bear all this burden.”
Folayan agreed with this statement, noting that "the movement is actually supported by black women and a lot of gay black women."
However, she insists that "this is not a case of positive discrimination" and that Ferrell was not chosen as the film's central character because of her distinctive features.
“She was the one who awakened that energy,” she said.
"On the other hand, it's not a coincidence that she was in the foreground because when"
You can feel her energy through the screen.”
Ferguson, meanwhile, has long had no film cameras, but there remain complex racial ties between the community and the police.
Ferrell will be on probation for another two-and-a-half years for blocking the highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place, which she calls home, simply: “Bardak”.
She's still holding on to a line she learned when she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.”
Two Salvadoran footballers disqualified for biting U.S. players
El Salvador national football team players Henry Romero and Darwin Seren received lengthy disqualifications for unsportsmanlike conduct.
During the quarter-final match of the Gold Cup of the Confederations of North and Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF), Salvadorans bit American players.
The first was the defender Henry Romero.
The El Salvadoran bit the attacker Josie Altidore, then pinched him by the chest.
Then the midfielder Seren when serving the corner in the penalty area bit the US defender Omar Gonzalez.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches and Serena for six.
The meeting ended with the victory of the Americans with a score of 2: 0, reports Goal.com.
The emergence of similarities: the artist creates portraits using the DNA of Chelsea Manning
In the center of the hall at the Friedman Gallery in New York, the faces of people - white, black and brown - hang from the ceiling on a wire, all somewhat inconspicuously similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Harborg from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning has sent in incisions from Fort Leavenworth prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for famously relaying confidential diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called “The Emergence of Similarities”.
This is the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Harborg, whose art combines technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and a famous dissident, whom Barack Obama commuted just three days before the end of his presidency.
By analyzing Manning’s DNA from a computer program and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of faces that could be in people with such a genome, Dewey-Harborg created a deep, though not easy-to-perceive manifesto dedicated not only to the plasticity of DNA data – the different ways of interpreting them and the inherent determinism of these interpretations – but also to the identity and identity of these interpretations.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has openly said since she was a teenager that she considers herself a woman, was sentenced in 2013 to 20 episodes, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her pictures in prison were unavailable, so only one photograph of her was known: a grainy black-and-white selfie, in which Manning, in a platinum shade of a wig, clearly feeling awkward, sits behind the wheel of a car; with this photo she became associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Harborg successfully completed her 2012 project Visions of Strangers.
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people with the help of forensic evidence such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from this garbage and creating images of what these people could look like.
And then she got an email from Paper Magazine.
“They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article,” Dewey-Hagborg explained at a preview of a new exhibition for the press.
Chelsea couldn’t be visited and photographed at the time, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted a portrait made of her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her imprisoned muse became friends by correspondence and exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even wrote a comic book, Repressed Images, illustrated by Shoila Kanungo, which depicted how in the future the president would commute Chelsea’s sentence and she would be able to visit the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama actually decided to release Manning just days after the book was published was a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
There’s something deep and powerful about the exhibition opening right now, as Donald Trump declares war on people who reveal classified information in government, and invents new ways to incite on Twitter the enmity he’s designed to mitigate.
When Dewey-Harborg was asked about the coincidence of all this in time, she said that "accidentally nothing happens."
In a statement from the artist, written on the gallery wall, Manning’s huge signature at the bottom (with a heart instead of a dot over the “i” in her name) calls for an end to “automatic separation based on gender, race, sexual orientation and culture.”
On the opposite side is its mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar of crayons C, G, and A.
Including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist elegantly puts it in scientific terms), Dewey-Harborg hoped to show how amazingly similar we all are, at least in terms of our biological structure.
“I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how open the genetic data is to interpretation, and how subjective it is,” Dewey-Harborg said.
“DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of those stories are here.”
The last part of the exposition, which fits in one room, is the above-mentioned novel in comics.
On it, Manning in the style of King Kong appears above the building of the Correctional Barracks of the United States with a loudspeaker in his hand.
“If they kill your speech, they will win,” it says.
"So never shut up."
“It’s a direct quote from a letter she wrote to me,” says the artist, greeting us from Philadelphia.
"I still have goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person – as it was prophetically portrayed in the comics – but when she arrives, she will be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genomic simulacra gathering like a crowd of protesters.
This is also done intentionally, as well as all at the exhibition up to the height (5"2, Manning height), on which the genetic haplogroups were drawn with a pencil.
“I used to hang them on the walls, but now I want them to look like a crowd of people,” Dewey-Harborg says of the portraits.
“I wanted them to be like the mass movement that formed around Chelsea, like the movement that was behind her liberation.”
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staffer wanted by police on murder charge
According to police, there is a nationwide raid on a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford, who are wanted as suspects in connection with the fact that in a luxurious room in Chicago was found stabbed to death.
According to Cook County Court records, arrest warrants were issued Monday for premeditated murder without bail for 42-year-old Wyndham Latham and 56-year-old Andrew Warren in connection with their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, twenty-six-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after being stabbed multiple times.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said the body was found on July 27.
The police received a call, they came to the apartment complex "Grand Plaza" and found the victim with several wounds on the body.
Officials say Cornell-Duranlo was pronounced dead at the scene and detectives are now investigating the knife-related death, while police are searching for two suspects.
Latham has held the position of Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cabbage, the university’s vice president of communications, said in an emailed statement that Latham was on administrative leave and was barred from entering Northwestern University campuses.
“This is now a criminal case that is being investigated by authorized persons, and Northwestern University is cooperating with the investigation,” Kabbaj said.
Warren is a Senior Fellow at the Financial Services Authority at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: “We have spoken to the UK police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the US investigating authorities.”
The statement also said Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to surrender.
Chicago Police Department Communications Chief Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly advised the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have suggestions about their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are intensifying,” Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielmi, local, regional and federal authorities are assisting in the search for the suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police were called by the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious message that something had happened in room 1008.
Police said the scene was horrific.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
According to him, the data from the video cameras confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza management issued an appeal to the guests, in which it was reported: "At the moment, the police are working on the chronology of the incident, collecting information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: “We will fulfill the requirements of the WADA road map in the near future”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), set for the resumption of the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), will be fulfilled in the near future.
“A certain stage in the implementation of the requirements has been passed, RUSADA received the right to plan and conduct tests together with UKAD (the anti-doping agency of Great Britain).
WADA’s road map has been updated accordingly,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of WADA’s road map for restoring the status of compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of RUSADA’s work and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could present difficulties for Russia.
“Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian anti-doping agencies should publicly recognize the results of an investigation commissioned by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which claimed that doping in Russian sports is controlled by the state.
Mutko said: “We are investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs, and we will not recognize what did not happen.
Mutko echoed the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian edition of Rsport, Smirnov acknowledged previous problems in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
Unconditionally, no one is going to accept this report," Smirnov added.
WADA suspended RUSADA from doping control in November 2015 after a doping scandal.
However, in June of this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to the organization’s Moscow office in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was “moving in the right direction” to resume its work.
A fire has been extinguished in a 79-storey tower in Dubai.
A major fire that occurred in one of the world’s tallest residential buildings, The Torch Tower, has been extinguished.
It is noted that the firefighters managed to cope with all the fires by 4.00 local time (3.00 MSK).
Local authorities said no one was injured in the incident.
At the time of the fire, the streets adjacent to the skyscraper were blocked.
The reasons for what happened are still unknown.
Earlier it was reported that the 79-storey residential skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world, is burning in Dubai.
All residents were evacuated on time.
The inconceivable outfit of Buzova shook the fans: pants that do not cover the panties
The scandalous host of the reality show "Dom-2" Olga Buzova amazed the audience of the Europa Plus Live festival with dances in shorts.
In front of thousands of fans, the newly-emerged singer performed the song "We will be hot" with Nastya Kudri.
Both girls came on the scene in provocative "pants", sewn in such a way that the underwear of the singers appeared.
On the trousers were made inscriptions Buzova and Kudry.
Earlier it was reported that changes in the appearance of Buzova commented the specialist of one of the Moscow clinics of plastic surgery.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
This was reported on Friday, August 4, the news service “Radio 4” with reference to foreign media.
According to him, the Russian authorities are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO Secretary General also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and “destabilization in eastern Ukraine.”
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia, however, is possible, and further escalation of the situation will not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump said that relations between the United States and Russia are at a dangerously low level, and accused the US Congress of this.
The Yekaterinburg metro is mastering a new method of payment
In October, travel in the Yekaterinburg metro will be possible to pay by bank card, said Pavel Vedernikov, general director of I-Net OJSC, in an interview with the regional newspaper.
Our goal is to introduce the same system of metro fare payment for the 2018 FIFA World Cup as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want fans from other countries, guests of the World Cup, to be able to use the metro with their bank cards, without buying tokens and not standing in line," he said.
Startups that will help your company not to become another “Uber”
Amy Errett wanted to gauge the level of satisfaction among her e-commerce startup’s employees, but the surveys didn’t work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, insincere.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
“He’s never been consistent and objective,” said Errett, who runs San Francisco-based Madison Reed, a 75-person e-commerce hair care company.
She turned to third parties for help.
Now there is a new kind of startups in the field of work with staff, which help companies to find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software designed to measure employee engagement, they allow companies to do express surveys, reach out to specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and hotlines for complaints, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass top management and contact management directly.
“We now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, but where is Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of Redwood City-based startup Glint, whose analytics programs are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said that she has achieved a greater understanding of what her employees think and feel over the three years of using Glint.
In addition to express surveys and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers a heat map of the company and shows in a visual form which departments have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows it to understand why.
Companies are a little aware that they need to control the situation in the workplace, otherwise they will become another “Uber”, which was involved in the scandal, when the former employee published a blog post in which he described an aggressive environment in which those who expressed discontent were punished.
For startups like Glint, this desire to control the situation is an opportunity for a profitable business.
According to the Internet portal “Let’s talk about payment”, dedicated to financial technologies, the industry of global management, regulation and compliance by 2020 can cost more than $ 118.7 billion.
Denver, Colorado-based startup Convertent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year amid a decline in Uber’s reputation.
Convertent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber appeared among customers.
Like Glint, Convert allows companies to send custom-made staff opinion polls, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go directly to the directorate.
“The court of public opinion has seized power from the inspectors,” said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and president of Convercent.
If it turns out that the company mistreats employees or behaves unethically, even if inspectors do not intervene, the company may face costly consequences in the form of boycotts by customers, employee outflows and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a chain of restaurants with more than 25,000 employees in 500 establishments, has used Convercent for more than a year to make sure employees are aware of the rules and procedures and offer an easy way to contact the company’s head office.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to look for a phone number or an email from the head office, file a formal complaint, and hope it was taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and embarrassing experience, said James Vitrano, head of the legal department at Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no normal way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convertent, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states – such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay – can be detected and addressed more quickly.
“I can approach a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the situation of employees,” said Vitrano, who heads the risk management team at Ruby Tuesday.
“And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees.”
According to Quinland, companies began to take ethics, values, and employee involvement more seriously in 2002, after accounting firm Arthur Andersen failed due to ethical violations as a result of the Enron Case.
But it wasn’t until “social media” became widespread that companies realized they couldn’t keep their dirty laundry from spreading virally online.
“Before starting to use technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both "Glint" and "Convercent" offer their software as a service, charging companies a regular fee for using their products.
This is a business model and opportunity that has received the approval of venture investors who have supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the company’s total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company’s total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing body of research shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than ever before.
In markets with tough competition, such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just the bare minimum.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated, and that they are devoting their time to a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy working at a company, feeling heard, and that the work they do is delivering results, they’re more committed to making that company a success,” says Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee satisfaction at LinkedIn, where both Convert and Glint are used.
Investors make revenue when companies from their portfolios do well; companies do well when employees are loyal and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee loyalty and engagement, it’s no surprise that they find support.
According to experts on culture in the workplace, it is important to have data on employee involvement.
But the data is useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it may give the impression that changes are coming.
And if change doesn’t happen fast enough, or doesn’t happen at all, frustration can develop and employees will lose interest.
“If you’re going to ask for 4,000 offers, you have to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations,” says Russell Rath, president of consulting at management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
“Because if you don’t go all the way, the staff will wonder, ‘Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don’t care, why shouldn’t I care?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, is able to take action the same day someone reports a problem with Glint.
And, after collecting feedback from employees dissatisfied with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new knowledge about its employees and hopes that in the long run, this knowledge will help it to more effectively retain employees in an industry known for high staff turnover.
“If you don’t try to create a culture of transparency, you lose people,” Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
In Barnaul open a new asphalt on Krasnoarmeysky Avenue
In Barnaul, cardinal measures were taken to eliminate the cause of asphalt failures on Krasnoarmeysky Avenue.
The place where twice there were pits on the recently paved roadway (intersection with the street Molodezhnaya), decided to "open".
Recall that the collapse of a small section of the road near the tram tracks was due to the fact that the ground was swept in the area of the ownerless unexploited network.
According to Ivan Garmat, Deputy Chairman of the City Committee on Road Economy, Public Works, Transport and Communications, a detailed survey will be conducted for a detailed examination and elimination of the prerequisites for the collapse.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is assumed that it will be necessary to restore the formwork of ownerless communications and their concreting.
This is reported on the official website of the regional capital.
The Bruins team has to practice longer due to the fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day
The time is approaching eleven o’clock in the evening; a crowd of football players from the University of California, Los Angeles is delayed to chat on one side of the team’s new training fields located on campus.
Some of them pulled off their T-shirts, revealing their backs gleaming with sweat after a busy first day of sports camp.
For many players, these minutes of idleness are a break in the middle of the day.
Players enrolled in summer classes will head back to their dorms after a three-hour practice session to prepare for their final exams, and return to Wasserman Football Center the next morning for meetings at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday, Bruins coach Jim Mora said: “In the next three days, these guys are going to have a meat grinder.”
The fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day, which was invented to reduce the workload for players, actually extended their working day – at least until the end of the exams on Friday.
Therefore, the start of the first three training sessions of the team of the University of California in Los Angeles was scheduled for 7:15 pm, so that they fit into the already dense schedule of players.
The side effect of not having two workouts a day was more days with one workout, and Bruins is moving the start of the camp by almost a week compared to last year and conducting training during the summer school for the first time in six seasons of Moray in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will hold 18 training sessions until August 20, inclusive, before starting official preparations for the first game of the season against the team of Texas A&M University in September.
Mora said he supported the change of rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that because of it, another item appeared in the tight schedule of players.
“For three or four days we give them this huge load, this is a serious test,” Mora said.
“And they just got over it, they’re working, they’re great guys.
I think when we get to Saturday and we have more time, it’s going to be really great.”
When the camp is over, the University of California, Los Angeles will make the trainings closed; this is not an easy task, as its fields are in direct view from the adjacent parking lot and from the neighboring Laskin Center, an expensive hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs that have overcome the protective net behind the gate.
Bruins players are due to occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admits that when the rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
“We will have security,” Mora said.
“It’s a serious problem, and I’m not exaggerating the danger by suggesting that someone can rent a room, sit there and record a workout on video.
If you have a training video, it’s very serious.
But we'll have security there, and we'll have security in parking lot number eight.
We will do everything we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan.”
All victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg were discharged from hospitals
All the victims of the terrorist attack in the St. Petersburg metro in April were discharged from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of the Vice-Governor Anna Mityanina.
As of the end of July, three people remained in hospitals, TV Center reports.
We will remind, the explosion in the subway of St. Petersburg occurred on April 3 this year.
The bomb was detonated by suicide bomber Akbarzhon Jalilov.
As a result of the attack, 15 people were killed, as well as the perpetrator himself.
In the criminal case, 11 people, including the alleged organizer Abror Asimov, were arrested.
Recall that on the eve of Rospotrebnadzor recommended the subway of St. Petersburg to revise the plan of measures to ensure transport security, in particular, increasing the number of frames of metal detectors.
Facebook strengthens fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook will be more likely to send texts suspected of hoaxes to independent experts and show their findings under original posts, the world’s largest social network said on Thursday, as it tries to crack down on so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the company said it is starting to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible hoaxes, send them for verification and possibly show the results of fact-checking under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways of spreading so-called fake news, which, according to many, influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue has also been hotly debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false reports ahead of the May presidential election, and in Germany before the September election said they supported a plan to fine social networks if they did not promptly remove hate-inciting posts.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook said it was testing a new fact-checking algorithm that had been launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to seeing which messages are challenged by independent reviewers, people want to have a broader context to make informed judgments about what they read and what they share,” Sarah Sue, Facebook’s news feed manager, wrote in her blog post.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the “linked articles” feature and work on other changes to the news feed to address the issue of fake news.
Create a novel-comic: One Castle in English History
In the recent past, the tiny castle of Scotty was filmed in the music video for "Squeeze", and in the 70s and 80s served as a haven for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy place in the valley of the Buhl River in the county of Kent, he has watched the turbulent history around, and now inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshireman with a head of hair and a penchant for historical documents, to a novel-comic.
“I think it’s so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago,” he says.
"You feel it so personally when you hold this letter in your hand."
Castle in England covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era and tells the story of the families who lived in Scotty; each story is illustrated by one of the young British artists - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This isn’t Rhodes’ first book to be based on archival data: In 2014, he wrote Dead Man’s Teeth and Other Stories, a collection of documents from the British Library, a project that unexpectedly touched him to the core.
“I could have been touched simply by a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for the Jacobites,” he says.
"It's his fingerprint."
And letters always smell of smoke, because in those days for lighting lit a fire.
And 300 years from now, in the future, you think you're there, too.
Oh, how I love archives!
For a man with such a passion for old papers, getting support from the National Endowment and the English Arts Council and living in a castle for four months (“Honestly, I’ve been there a little bit”) seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days studying the "new" Victorian castle, going through the archives and examining the numerous treasures of the estate and ancient things - for example, the heads of hyenas on the walls or bottles that had lain in the pit for centuries.
He walked through the park and the ruins of the old castle, talking to foresters, gardeners, and sometimes artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
Then, at night, he “drank whiskey and sat down to write.”
The history of the castle is not very studied, because the National Fund received full access to it only in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff was just beginning to deal with the archive, which he describes as “what aristocrats have been throwing at the attic for centuries.”
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps showing who owned what: “You think land disputes are boring,” says Rhodes, “but there were two families fighting over this birch.
It happens, guys!”
In some stories of the collection, the castle becomes the starting point for wider explorations in English history: for example, in The Worker, the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasant Revolution of 1381.
“There is evidence of a rebellion that occurred at the castle in 1380, in a book called The Knights of Kent and Sussex,” says Rhodes.
"The Peasants' Revolt began in these places, and I thought the rebellion was a good start.
Maybe they were related?”
Other stories are strongly associated with the history of the castle - for example, "The Priest", which tells about the Jesuit priest, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or “The Smuggler,” about 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have staged his own funeral by stoning the coffin (this was discovered a few years later when the coffin was dug up).
The Durrells are the favorite family of Rods of all who inhabited Scotty: "Gentlemen seem to have been a perfect cheat, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, men-Darrell solved their problems with debt, marrying rich elderly women - I imagine them as a company of nice guys who know how to care for the heirs of large fortunes. "
After finishing his work at the castle, Rhodes looks for other opportunities to gain a unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in the Finnish wilderness, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elyamenm<0xC3><0xA4>ki - a place where at the beginning of the 20th century there was a sanatorium, and then it was overgrown with forest again.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
“I was sad to leave,” he said.
“I felt like, ‘Damn, I have to go back to real life.’
Fifteen of the largest banks choose “Russia”
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: after Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alfa-Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselkhozbank, Binbank and FC Otkritie, seven more credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, the share of organizations left the ARB will account for at least 80 percent of the market.
But this is not just a way out - all banks that declared a break with the ARB are negotiating with another public organization that unites credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks "Russia", which is headed by the famous politician Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on the financial market, recognized, by the way, at the end of the last session and the most effective head of the Duma committee and the deputy on colic.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was made during the discussion in the Federation Council, when the Interregional Banking Council considered new draft laws, in particular, involving a new classification of banks depending on the size of the authorized capital.
Then Garegin Tosunyan, the president of the ARB, said that, in the opinion of the association, this bill is adopted in the interests of the largest banks, which are thus trying to limit the capabilities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions, intercepting their clientele.
Among other claims, there was criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunyan, does not always justify the revocation of licenses from some banks, which, however, was followed by an objection from a representative of the Central Bank: many of the heads of the fined banks, in particular, Vneshprombank, were members of the governing bodies of the ARB.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive opinions in a very sensitive to relations with the main regulator of the banking environment and became a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks, having expressed disagreement with the policy of the ARB, began to prepare for joining the association "Russia", noting that "the efficiency of the ARB will deteriorate at a low level, and a constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually conducted."
Investors will be better off.
How's this going to end?
Let's answer immediately the main question that arises at the slightest failure or conflict in the banking sector or near it: depositors are not threatened, rather, on the contrary, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
Anatoly Aksakov, known for his scrupulousness in everything that concerns the interests of banks and their clients, is a high-level professional who is highly valued by the Central Bank: almost all the leadership of the Central Bank is present at the annual events of the Association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator pass through the expert assessments of the “regionals”.
In terms of personnel and organization, obviously, there are no special shocks.
Undoubtedly, the ARB finds itself in a difficult financial and management situation after losing such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying opportunities.
However, in this oldest - established in 1991 - organization defending the interests of the banking community, there is considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the sphere of monetary circulation in general.
It can not be said that the association "Russia" with open arms are ready to accept new members on any terms, judging by the reaction of its leader, Anatoly Aksakov ("may want too much"), who on July 21 at a briefing in the press center of the Parliamentary newspaper, said that "literally the next day the representatives of the Association of ARB banks" asked me to consider the possibility of growing.
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council, as well as to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiation process is underway, the proposals of both sides are being studied, the agenda of the extraordinary association congress is being prepared, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September in the framework of the international banking forum.
That's where we'll decide.
Also, Anatoly Aksakov, stressing that "he does not hold on to the chair," called Georgy Luntovsky, who is leaving the post of deputy chairman of the Central Bank in September, a possible new head of the renewed association "Russia", highly characterizing his business and human qualities.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is currently vacationing in Crimea, plans to interrupt his vacation for one day and arrive in Moscow for an extraordinary meeting of the Russia Association Council, where he is scheduled to consider the agenda of an extraordinary congress of Russia.
The entry of cars with a gasoline engine in major cities of Russia will not be limited
Deputy head of the Ministry of transport Nikolai Asaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of cars with a gasoline engine in major cities of Russia will not be limited.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually raise the ecological class.
And there is the concept of immediately moving to zero emissions.
I don't think we're technically ready for that.
The question is, what year?
This is a slogan – let’s ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Will the whole city be closed?
“In 20 years, I don’t know, maybe it will happen,” Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said.
Earlier, the newspaper "Izvestia" reported that by August 17, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was instructed to study proposals on possible options for state support of electric transport, submitted to the government by the General Director of PJSC KamAZ Sergey Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, - the use of cars with ICE in large cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for getting a green card.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump said that a new US immigration plan will be adopted, according to which the rules for obtaining a green card will change.
The plan calls for reducing the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules on temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the president.
The bill will be debated in two chambers of Congress.
“This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and will do so by changing the way the U.S. issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
“The new application process will provide benefits to candidates who speak English, have the monetary resources that allow them to support themselves, and have the skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
The emergence of sex robots is real, and it should worry us
We did not have time to think that 2017 could not get worse, a new report on technological advances in the production of sex robots came out.
Yup.
Sex robots are now in the spotlight.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, Distinguished Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we should take them seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of the eyes of the robots, the shape of the nipples and the type of nails.
“People are giggling about it, but companies are already sending them to consumers in large numbers, and we will soon see much more of them,” Sharkey said at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable counterparts into robots with silicone skin, warm to the touch, and with almost human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also "customize" their robots to their liking, choosing everything from the color of the eyes and the shape of the robot's nipples to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a “personality” compared to which the Stepford Wife would appear to be very progressive is even more troubling.
Modern sex dolls have turned into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the firm RealBotix robot allows users to customize in robots the quality that they find attractive, such as shyness.
There are also Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion, which come with an already programmed personality - for example, Cold Farrah makes an impression of shyness, and Wild Wendy has a "bold" character.
“Roxxxy Gold has a character that fits yours perfectly,” reports True Companion.
So she likes what you love, doesn’t like what you don’t like, and so on.
She changes her mood during the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or chat, or she may “be in the mood”!
There is much to be worried about in the emergence of sex robots – not least because they replace real human relationships – but what is most disturbing is the subordinate image of the woman, the association with rape, which is caused by the mastery of the Cold (read: resisting) Lighthouse.
On the website "True Companion" Roxxxy is compared to a vibrator, only for men.
“If a woman (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can’t men have Roxxxy?”
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a departure from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional supplement.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and although FRR notes their growing popularity, they still remain on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very instructive with regard to the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people are not bad or aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It’s no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots emerged at a time when women’s rights around the world were under threat, when there is a president in the White House who boasts of pandering to women.
The scariest thing about The Handmaid’s Tale isn’t the graphic images, the twisted bodies, and the squeezed eyes, but how realistic that vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but it does not seem so great now.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to achieve the kind of physical similarity to real women (only with the proportions of porn stars) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to seem human to the touch, to copy the movements of the human body.
But it is their "character" robots do not look like real women.
They can’t break up with their partners or leave them.
They have no life of their own, no biography – nothing that could point to independence or anything else that could shatter the illusion of complete dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, maids.
Los Angeles native Eugene (Pooh) Jeter, who has been playing for the Ukrainian national team since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which starts on August 31.
About this in an interview with the portal BeBasket said the general manager of "blue-yellow" Andrey Lebedev.
We tried to make a deal with Jeter, but unfortunately, he's not coming for family reasons.
We will go to the EuroBasket without a naturalized player, because we don’t want to take someone we don’t know.
“This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players,” he said.
Let me remind you: with the direct participation of Jeter, the Ukrainian team took a record sixth place for itself at the EuroBasket 2013 and for the first time got to the world basketball championship, where the "yellow-blue" could not overcome the group stage, and the US native scored an average of 15.4 points for the game, made 3 rebounds and gave 5 assists.
Jeter has stopped playing for the Ukrainian national team since leaving the post of head coach of our national team, American Mike Fratello, who left this post in 2015.
The men’s EuroBasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold their matches of the group tournament on the Promised Land.
Evgeny Murzin’s wards in Group B will have five fights: with Germany (August 31), Italy (September 2), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for the tournament, our men’s team held two control matches, in which it lost to the Dutch and Belarusians.
Trump's great feat?
To pretend to be Mitt Romney seems very reasonable.
In the Trump era, the common ground was the fact that political disputes, which polarized the American electorate, broke up some families at the micro level.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers ran columns on how to deal with the terrible relatives voting for Trump.
I think we're all so tense that we're about to burst.
Less is said about Trump’s ability to connect families.
I’m writing this because my cousin, a left-leaning Chicago poet who has long been on the chopping block with Republicans in her family, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Under Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including a Republican brother with whom she has argued about politics for decades, suddenly and strangely found themselves on the same side.
Over dinner this is undoubtedly a good thing; but I can’t help but think that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has infused forces into the left flank, but the deforming effect of his rule could shift us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and “normalization,” we are referring to the unlikely possibility that one day we will stop being astounded by his antics.
There is, however, an even more dubious scenario in which Trump “normalizes” the most right-wing Republicans, who, against the background of his standards, will suddenly appear to be a model of common sense.
I caught myself really missing out on Mitt Romney’s old-fashioned craziness today – with a dog on the roof of the car and a 14 percent income tax (but we at least knew what his tax return looked like) – compared to Trump, both seem very small evils.
When Trump leaves, it will be enough for the next Republican candidate to just be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we went with the kids to a carousel in Central Park — the largest carousel in the New York Department of Parks household and the best way in town to spend three dollars if you don’t need caffeine.
The horses are formidable and huge, the glass-fiber pictures on the central drum - grimacing clowns and animals that, bent over, look at their backs in horror - extremely ominous, and the ringing music, strangely enough, excites.
So many famous things in this city are disappointing: the views from the skyscrapers are outdated, the silhouettes of the buildings are too old to cause awe, and the reality of the city does not keep up with the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I’m still living the day I found out that the Swiss Cottage area is not really a Swiss chalet (the theme pub “Ye Olde Swiss Cottage” doesn’t count), but a large roundabout in North London.
And the carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place in which a child of two years, a child of eleven and two women in forty can have a great time.
If I could give the carousel an estimate, I would give it a five, but luckily no one asked me to.
And in the department store this week, I was asked to rate my shopping experience on a scale of one to five stars before placing a card on the terminal.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street it's still the same plus the option to accompany the estimate of tea at 15 percent - it's for the order at the counter.
As a result, not only does the interaction that is neutral in the idea slow down, but you also have to make a personal attitude in a situation that does not imply it.
The poor saleswoman at the department store was smiling confusedly while I was tired of appreciating my experience of giving her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pain
Pistorius leaves prison because of a visit to the doctor for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to the hospital for the treatment of wrist cuts, which, according to the prison administration, he received as a result of a fall in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of premeditated murder after the prosecutor's office appealed the initial verdict for premeditated murder.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine’s Day in 2013, shooting her several times through the bathroom door of his Pretoria home.
Pistorius said he took his girlfriend for a night thief hiding in his bathroom.
The prosecutor's office has said it intends to file another protest, this time against Praetorius' six-year sentence, which it says is too lenient.
The Attorney General's Office said it would appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court and the appeal would be heard this year.
The term of Pretoria can be extended by 15 years if the prosecution succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Suspect in the beating of a journalist NTV elected a subscription to stay
Metropolitan law enforcement officers chose a measure of restraint in the form of a subscription for the man who attacked a journalist of the NTV channel Nikita Razvozjaev during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation Irina Volk.
“In the framework of the investigation of the criminal case initiated under article 116 of the criminal code (“beatings”) against a 32-year-old man who hit the face of a correspondent of one of the TV channels in the Central Park of Culture and Recreation named after Gorky, the suspect was selected as a preventive measure in the form of a subscription for not leaving and proper behavior,” said Volk.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol was drawn up against the suspect for disobedience to the police.
On Wednesday, August 2, during a live broadcast on the Day of the Airborne Troops, an intoxicated man approached the correspondent and struck him in the face.
As it turned out later, the hooligan has nothing to do with the airborne.
According to Razvozjaev himself, the paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to detain the Muscovite.
Two Bulgarians Arrested in Greece for Illegal Tent Parking
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking.
On the morning of August 1, a group of people who had set up tents in the wrong place, including two Bulgarian citizens, were detained in Sithonia.
They were released on the same day, while the investigation is still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the BBC TV channel that the citizens of Bulgaria were then released.
Greek authorities have tightened controls on free camping and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone caught parking in a place not designated for that purpose.
Inspections will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court can impose a fine.
The Russian foreign Ministry accused the Vice-President of the United States in the rhetoric of the “cold war”
Statements made during the European tour of US Vice President Michael Pence have been criticized by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
“It is with regret that we have to state that Washington is sliding ever deeper into the primitive ideological cliches of the Cold War, which are completely detached from reality,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Thus, the Foreign Ministry reacted to Pence’s words about the “Russian threat” and attempts to forcibly redraw the borders, which he said in Podgorica.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed to the destructiveness of the choice “either with the West or with Russia” and the unobviousness of the thesis about the supposedly non-alternative accession of the whole of South-Eastern Europe to NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by using force to drive Kosovo away from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
"We call on our American colleagues to stop the shelling of Russia and its foreign policy line, which is invariably based on respect for partners and readiness for joint constructive work, on mutual consideration of interests," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
The paramedic was injured in an accident with an ambulance in the suburbs
The accident occurred in Stupino near Moscow, as a result of a collision of a foreign car with an ambulance, a paramedic was injured.
Today at about 08:10 GMT there was a collision of a Mitsubishi car with an ambulance in the city of Stupino, Moscow region.
"As a result of the collision, the ambulance overturned," the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Moscow region told TASS.
Law enforcement officers work at the scene of the accident, the circumstances of the incident are being clarified.
In the Odessa region, a woman threw her newborn son at the construction site, wrapped in a cellophane bag.
In the evening of August 3, the Razdelnyansky police department received a message from a local resident that he had found a package with an infant in an unfinished private house.
"Law enforcement officers and doctors went to the scene of the incident, who promptly brought the child to a medical institution," the Odessa chapter of the National Police said.
Doctors determined that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of an umbilical cord.
In the course of priority operational and investigative measures, the identity of the woman giving birth was established - a 36-year-old local resident.
It is also established that the woman has three other young children.
As noted in the chapter, in the field of view of law enforcement officers, the family had not previously fallen and was not on special account.
At present, the police establish the circumstances and reasons that offered the woman to this act, after which a procedural decision will be made.
The baby is now under the supervision of doctors.
As previously reported, in Nikolaev, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature baby in the garbage disposal.
Grigory Leps: "I rush into battle, although 55 is not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian pop Grigory Leps will celebrate his 55th birthday next Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer talked with the observer of "Izvestia".
I remember when you said, "Pentecost."
A special tent in Luzhniki, Gloria Gaynor sang for the birthday boy, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
You must have been thinking about how you'd like to spend your next five years.
Did the plans come true?
Speaking of the profession, it was a good time.
I worked hard, toured the whole country three times, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
He has released two good albums.
I’m not the same person I was, say, 20 years ago.
The biological clock cannot be fooled.
Singing the way I sang in my 30s is getting harder.
I'm in a fight, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm going to a different level.
With them, you record a new album, the first one in three years.
Yeah, we're working on it now.
Actually, we've already recorded everything in my studio, and now we're going to send it to Los Angeles.
It's called "Why Are You So Serious?" from the song of the same name, which was co-written with Timati.
It's not quite ready yet, so we haven't put it anywhere yet.
We'll do it later, when we shoot the clip on it.
And the album will be presented in November - for a series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow's Crocus City Hall.
Your new record was hand-in-hand with great American drummer Chris Coleman.
Do you think you wanted to include him in your tour?
In my opinion, Coleman today is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world.
He would come to my studio and record his parts.
I asked him to join my band, and Jeremy Coulson (a well-known drummer involved in various projects. - "Izvestia") offered.
But for long-term work in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
We were talking about fees from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35,000 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45,000 per month.
Then I thought that in the post-Soviet space I would find worthy musicians.
And found a great drummer Max Malyshev.
It is better to feed them.
Sometimes I want to fight with one of them, not for what.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly listed internationally.
Western music magazines write about him, he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wye, after listening to his play, said that "a new generation of guitarists has arrived, with a different performing technique."
Your album is made in Los Angeles, American musicians cooperate with you, but you still can not come to the United States?
Are you trying to lift the ban?
To be honest, I’m not doing anything right now.
There are a number of lawyers who deal with this issue.
As a musician, I am truly sorry that I can’t make it to America.
I have said many times that I am studying there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful it is.
We don't fool them, but we don't have that experience, that school.
Our performers of popular music for 70 years did not set the tasks that have always been solved by American musicians.
They wanted the highest quality sound.
I try to follow the same principles.
For some reason, the UK has refused me entry for ten years.
But I will still apply every year for a visa at the British Embassy so that I can go there again and, most importantly, work there.
The rest of Europe has been kind to me.
And already in August you are planning a concert in Monaco, not a custom, but a poster, right?
Yes, Monte Carlo has a good hall "Sporting", I've been there once.
I’ve been invited back and as far as I know, all the concert tickets have already sold out.
Are you going to the "Lima Vaikula Rundeva", which will begin on July 20 in Jurmala?
She invited me, and of course I responded.
Lyme is a wonderful singer and a great woman who knows how to present herself with beautiful vocals and even a whisper.
After touring and anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you once again want to turn to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
You already have two albums with his songs in your discography.
When will the third one come out?
Probably next year.
But it will be done in a completely different way.
I want to record about 80-90 Vysotsky songs in about the same pitch as he did himself.
Just voice and guitar.
No other arrangement.
Accompanying me will be our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I will try to attract Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum to participate in the album.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so we'll see how it goes.
You and the songs of Boris Grebenshchikov gradually entered into his repertoire.
Why don't you record an album of his stuff later?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a great musician.
I met him several times and asked: can I sing one or another of his songs?
He said, "Gregory, I write songs so that they can be performed."
Please try it, sing it.
It would be interesting to record such an album.
I do not have such a task yet, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich does not object, I may do such a project.
Unless you focus entirely on your production center.
I suppose you haven't yet realized its potential, signed contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers that I would like to have under my wing, but they are independent, accomplished people.
Do you mean Sergei Lazarev?
Seryozha is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may disagree with his repertoire, but he is a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center now there is Alexander Panayotov, whom I led in the "Voice".
We have a contract and we are working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It would be a shame if he did not reach the heights he deserves.
I'm trying to pick up his repertoire, shoot clips.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists of my center: I buy them songs, I cry to poets, sometimes their tracks get into the rotation of TV and radio channels.
If they do not reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
On the release, they will receive a recorded album, several clips.
And then, if they want, they can go their own way, and I will not insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although I would be pleased if one of them would achieve commercial success and pay me the interest that we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to block anyone's oxygen.
Let everyone work, break through, prove, as I once proved.
If tomorrow you are offered to make a tour of Ukraine and guaranteed entry into the country, will you go?
I'm still being invited.
These are mostly closed events.
As for the big tour...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, and I am convinced that I flew to Syria on the same plane that crashed.
If tomorrow they say that it is necessary to fly to some other point in the interests of the state, I will fly.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think of me.
I sincerely regret that we have had such a situation with Ukraine.
Because I believe that we are one people and we should be together.
I regret that this is unlikely to happen, at least in the near future.
I used to give 40-50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
They met like nowhere else.
A very grateful audience.
And he collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorak, Sveta Loboda, Artem Loik...
There are a lot of talented people in Ukraine, and it is truly a pity that now they can not fully throw their talent to a wide Russian audience.
Music should bring people together and entertain them.
I would be happy to invite some cool Ukrainian singer to Russia, for example, Slava Vakarchuk, and make a joint concert with him.
But I don't think that's likely at the moment...
Andrey Okhlopkov was transferred from the cosmodrome
As it became known to Kommersant, the technical director of the Vostochny cosmodrome Andrey Okhlopkov began work at the Khrunichev State Space Research and Production Center.
Previously, he was de facto engaged in the construction of the Vostochny cosmodrome, but due to disagreements with the leadership of the Center for the Exploitation of Terrestrial and Space Infrastructure (CENCI), he was transferred to the enterprise in Moscow Branches, where he will coordinate production.
Mr. Okhlopkov will not have a replacement: the post of technical director will most likely be abolished, and the functionality will be scattered around the units of TsENKI.
About the fact that the technical director of the East and the deputy general director of TsENKI for technological development Andrey Okhlopkov moved to work in the Khrunichev GKNPC, "Kommersant" told the top managers of several enterprises of the space industry, as well as an employee of the government apparatus.
"He has been working on a new post for several weeks," Kommersant interlocutors in the industry said.
It was not possible to get an operative comment from Tsenki on Thursday, and Mr. Okhlopkov himself was not available for comments.
However, the information "Kommersant" was officially confirmed in the GKNPC.
He decided to move to the position of Director for production coordination, - said at the enterprise. - Andrei Okhlopkov set before him the task to ensure the launch minimum for the first launch at the Vostochny cosmodrome fully fulfilled.
Mr. Okhlopkov moved to work at Tsenki in 2013, having served in space troops, in particular at Baikonur, and in Plesetsk - at the "northern" cosmodrome, he held the post of first deputy commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Okhlopkov became a defendant in a criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly, from his submission, regional merchants received state orders for kickbacks, but did not fulfill their obligations to clean up the separated parts of launch vehicles in the Arkhangelsk region and the Komi Republic.
In 2012, a jury found him not guilty.
The technological development responsibilities assigned to him by CENCI extended to various projects, but the main one was the construction of a spaceport in the Far East.
The then head of the Federal space Agency Oleg Ostapenko in an interview with "Kommersant" directly said that the situation in the East "was critical already in October 2013."
The fact is that during the planning, a strategic mistake was made: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 launch vehicle were planned for the same time - the end of 2015.
To carry out the launch before the end of the year, it was decided to complete the construction six months earlier and the deadlines were shifted from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process, it was necessary to go to the trick: the specialists of Tsenki began to conduct a parallel installation of technological equipment on unfinished objects.
The main supporter of this idea was Andrei Okhlopkov.
Despite the existing risks and the transfer that took place (instead of December 2015, the Soyuz departed only on April 28, 2016), this idea justified itself, the source of Kommersant at the spaceport says: “Otherwise we would not have carried out a single launch from the East, but would have been engaged in construction.”
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who oversees the creation of the spaceport, jokingly called Andrei Okhlopkov his “cosmic Susanin”, but it was from him that he almost always asked for information about the progress of construction.
Remember Mr. Okhlopkov and directness: for example, in an interview with Kommersant, he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Spetsstroy) of the status of the sole contractor for the East and directly work with subcontractors: "Why should we put all the eggs in one basket Spetsstroy?"
This idea has found support in the government.
Since 2017, Tsenki has taken over the duties of the general contractor in order to complete the construction and installation work on the launch and technical complex by the planned fourth quarter.
According to Kommersant, the reason for the transition of Mr. Okhlopkov to the new place of work were disagreements with the leadership of Tsenki regarding the ways to complete the construction of structures and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as methods of work with subcontractors.
“It was decided that it would be better for everyone,” says one of the top managers involved in the construction of the East.
An employee of the government apparatus, in turn, calls the decision strange: "He was one of the best specialists, it will not be easy to find an equivalent replacement for him."
According to Kommersant, this will not be necessary: the post of technical director of the cosmodrome will be abolished, and its functions will be scattered among the units of TsENKI.
In music schools there will be a program of training for two specialties
In the future, students of children's music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture Svyatoslav Golubenko, for this purpose it is possible to re-read repeated disciplines for students, and the issue of paying for the remaining classes in the second specialty to be solved with the help of special grants, RIA Novosti reports.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue under control, and we, together with the expert community, will develop a mechanism that will allow mastering two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education," Golubenko said.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin’s “Nedetsky talk” with students of the Sirius children’s center, a student Maria Andreeva reported that she was forced to pay for repetitive subjects in the second specialty at the Central School at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she is studying violin and piano and has awards in competitions in both directions.
The head of state recognized her question as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico detained climbed the wall to the skyscraper 17-year-old Russian
In Mexico detained 17-year-old Russian Kirill N., who climbed the wall on the roof of a high-rise building, according to the portal El Universal.
The incident took place in the capital of Mexico.
The young man with the help of two unknown men climbed over a three-meter fence into the territory of the complex of office buildings of the company Nestle and independently climbed into one of its towers.
At the same time, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and ropes.
The young man was already on the roof.
The Ministry of Public Security dropped him on the ground in a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute of Migration.
There they find out whether the young man is legally on the territory of the country.
Meanwhile, a video of a young man climbing a skyscraper has become popular on the Internet.
Users called the young man a “spider-man”.
As the media writes, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate may help ease IBD.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products may help relieve symptoms in those who suffer from inflammatory bowel disease.
This incurable disease, which affects approximately 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 in the UK, leads to colic and bloating, chronic or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Usually, to relieve symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers from the University of Washington found that the main amino acid of the protein tryptophan promotes the production of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
Lead researcher Dr Marco Colonna explained that immune cells in the gut make sure that harmful microbes coming from food do not enter the body.
Cells that are able to trigger the inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too much disturbed in the direction of inflammation, this can lead to inflammatory bowel diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice that have a certain bacteria in the intestines have cells that increase tolerance.
And this bacterium needs tryptophan — one of the building blocks of protein — to trigger the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have established a link between one species of bacteria – Lactobacillus reuteri – which is part of the normal gut microbiome, and the development of a population of tolerance-enhancing cells.
The more tryptophan there was in the mice’s diet, the more of these immune cells they had.”
He suggested that the same would work in humans: a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less inflammatory environment in the gut.
Postdoc Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragánvas, studying a variety of tolerance-enhancing immune cells, found that one group of experimental mice had these cells, and the other group, which belonged to the same line, but was contained separately, did not.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the gut microbiomes of mice — communities of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the mice’s gut cells was sequenced, and six types of bacteria were found present in mice that had immune cells but were absent in mice that didn’t.
Mice grown in a sterile environment that did not have a good microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cells received L. reuteri, and immune cells appeared in them.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid medium and then transferred small portions of the fluid — without the bacteria — to underdeveloped immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells have turned into cells that increase tolerance.
When the active ingredient was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan processing, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice’s food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan level was halved, the number of cells also fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that humans have the same tolerance-boosting cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri contribute to cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but in people suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, defects in the genes associated with tryptophan have been found.
She says, "We may need to step up the development of these cells, because these cells are responsible for the inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines.
High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri could potentially lead to an expansion of their population.”
According to Jose Mourinho, “Manchester United” hired a “genius” in the person of Nemanja Matic
Manchester United hired a “genius” in the person of Nemanja Matic, according to Jose Mourinho after the midfielder made his debut in the match against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The <0xC2><0xA3>40 million Chelsea player started with a 2-1 win in Dublin in United's last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Thursday and made an impression as a midfielder, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira broke through in the first round.
However, since Matic did not take part in the pre-season tour of Chelsea in Asia, he seriously lacked preparation for the game, and he lasted only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, requires revision before the start of the season of the Premier League.
“He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius is the way he thinks – he thinks football,” Mourinho said.
“We will help him prepare sooner rather than later.”
Like Matic, his fellow new players Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started the game at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to form his main squad by the start of the next season.
The Independent newspaper reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he would like to hire in the first place.
“I’m grateful to the club for getting three out of four,” he added.
“I’ll be even happier if they get me four out of four, but they’ve already done a lot for me.”
Former leaders of Lithuania’s Social Democrats urge them to stay in ruling coalition
Former chairmen of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, former prime ministers Algirdas Butkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as former Speaker of the Seimas from the Social Democrats <0xC4><0x8C>eslovas Jur<0xC5><0xA1>enas appealed to the party members to remain in the ruling coalition.
As reported by the "Parliamentary newspaper", due to friction with partners - the Union of peasants and "green" - the Social Democratic Party initiated a discussion whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
And here the three senior experienced comrades addressed to fellow party members with an open letter, in which, in particular, it is stated: "It is understandable that the party comrades are disappointed with the results of the elections, but the coalition with the "peasants" has created for us, albeit not very easy, but still conditions for the further implementation of the goals of social justice, which, on our initiative, the party is provided for in the program of the government, and for the preservation of the political domain."
According to the former leaders of the party, in the discussion so far "the expression of opinion based on emotions prevailed without specific arguments."
The authors of the letter fear that the ill-considered actions of their party could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
Disabled Anton Mamaev was sentenced to a fine
The Moscow City Court commuted the punishment of wheelchair user Anton Mamaev from four and a half years of imprisonment to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
Earlier, by the decision of the Timiryazevsky court, the convicted person was released from the pre-trial detention center.
At the same time, the Moscow City Court confirmed that the accused is a criminal, because he organized the robbery and theft of a scooter from a former special forces soldier.
The Moscow City Court, by its decision, commuted the punishment of Anton Mamaev to 200 thousand rubles. fine.
"Mamayev is the organizer of the robbery, which also forms the basis of the crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be brought to criminal responsibility," said Ulyana Solopova, spokeswoman for the Moscow City Court.
In this case, the court took into account the state of health of Mamayev, the actual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied Article 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which it is possible to impose a punishment below the lower limit.
As for the assistant of Mamayev Vasily Seroshtanov, the court did not establish the circumstances that would become the basis for changing the category of gravity of the committed and changing the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself said that he was dissatisfied with the decision of the Moscow City Court.
I am disappointed with the court’s decision.
The only legitimate solution would be an excuse, intending to continue to fight for justice.
His lawyer Andrey Orlov did not rule out appealing the verdict in the Moscow City Court of Cassation and the Supreme Court.
“We will use all the levers up to the European Court of Human Rights,” he told RIA Novosti.
Recall, 28-year-old Muscovite Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, became a defendant in a criminal case in the fall of last year.
The invalid claims that he bought a scooter from friends for 160 thousand rubles., and then sell.
However, the owners of the scooter, including a former special forces fighter, said that the disabled man and his assistant Vasily Seroshtanov took away their property, threatening to use violence.
On June 30, the Timiryazevsky District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years in prison, and Anton Mamayev to four and a half years in prison with serving a sentence in a general regime colony (under Part 2 of Article 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After the immobilized disabled person was placed in a pre-trial detention center, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General's Office, the Commissioner for Human Rights under President Tatyana Moskalkova, joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamayev was released from jail by the decision of the same Timiryazev court.
The defense, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in the Moscow City Court.
UNF will prepare a report on the environment to the President
The final "Forum of Action" of the All-Russian People's Front (ONF) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, a source in the ONF told Izvestia and confirmed the head of the executive committee of the movement Alexei Anisimov.
According to him, following the results of the forum, the “frontmen” plan to prepare a report to the president on the problems of the domestic environment, as well as to propose a strategy for solving them.
The interlocutors of “Izvestia” in the ONF note that the report to the head of state will contain a “deep analysis” of the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to “Izvestia”, the final forum of the ONF will be held in the autumn.
The exact date of its holding has not yet been determined - as a rule, it is adjusted to the schedule of the president, who is the leader of the movement and traditionally present at key events of the ONF.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts - in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final conference will be held in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been made and will be made at these events, we will form systemic proposals to solve environmental problems," the source told Izvestia.
Olga Timofeeva, co-chair of the movement’s Central Staff, who heads the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that the “frontmen” will report to the head of state on the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the ONF "Forum of Action" will most likely be combined.
Over the year, we have grown a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental problems, saw gaps in the legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All this will be included in the report that we are preparing for the president as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, "frontline" report and work on priority projects ONF, - told "Izvestia" Olga Timofeeva.
According to her, the special representative of the head of state on environmental activities, ecology and transport Sergey Ivanov will also be invited to the forum.
Previously, he had already participated in the ONF Media Forum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will go down in history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental mechanisms so that they work for many years.
So that these issues do not fall off the agenda, - added Olga Timofeeva.
Andrey Kolyadin, Head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EESI), noted that by raising environmental issues, the ONF is acting in line with the presidential agenda.
They offered many things as experts in various forums, and these initiatives received the support of the president, Andrey Kolyadin told Izvestia.
He stressed that the economic potential of the environmental agenda cannot be ruled out today, which can give the regions additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of the ONF, the regions will be able to lobby not only for the solution of their environmental problems, but also for the development of ecotourism, - the expert added.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by a “straight line” with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked about the landfill in Balashikha (already closed) and about coal dust in the port of Nakhodka (already developed a bill to ban open transshipment of coal in settlements, one of the authors - Olga Timofeeva).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal framework for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been created, the question is in the further law enforcement practice, as well as in the position of civil society.
We need a clear implementation of the decisions taken by the state, - said the head of the charitable foundation "Ecology for All" Leonid Bochin.
A member of the HRC, the head of the non-governmental organization "Greenpeace of Russia" Sergey Tsyplenkov in a conversation with "Izvestia" stressed that for a successful solution of environmental problems a responsible approach of society and business is necessary, only legislative efforts are few.
As soon as society and business realize that solving environmental problems is a much more profitable step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change, - said Sergey Tsyplenkov.
The expert stressed that it is necessary to reverse the trend that violation of environmental legislation is an economically profitable solution for business.
British inventor implanted a microchip to get into a house and car at the stroke of the hand
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could open the door of his house, enter the office and even start the car with a simple wave of his hand.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam implanted a tiny chip between his thumb and index finger and now offers this service through his company BioTech to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives through technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist-consultant from the Royal in Winchester, to ensure that the implantation procedure was carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip that is implanted in cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
The Northam company is also replacing locks in homes and cars with chip-compatible ones at a price of <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock.
The married father of one child has already installed the technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when his hand is lying on the steering wheel.
Props for the White House cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
According to military records provided to TIME magazine, the White House’s decision last month to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event dedicated to U.S. industrial production cost taxpayers as much as $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as "Marine One" when the president is on board, became the centerpiece of a July 17 event at the White House that showcased U.S. construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and top White House officials inspected technology products from all fifty states.
The helicopter, made in Connecticut, was displayed next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a truck from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Marine Helicopter Squadron (HMX-1), the department responsible for helicopter control, the White House War Office ordered the presence of the helicopter in a private order, or “FRAGO”, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of an “unusual” event.
“I just wanted you to make sure you knew because it’s an unusual event widely covered in the press,” the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his superior, the first deputy chief of aviation of the Marine Corps, on the eve of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on July 17 to participate in an event scheduled for 3 p.m. and would remain there until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required for the return flight, in line with working hours restrictions.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, and the unit’s security officers stayed close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From the records obtained by TIME, it was unclear whether a second crew was needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the event contradicts this regulation.
“Among other things, we asked if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were told it wasn’t,” the commander wrote.
“You don’t seem to have anywhere to go,” the deputy chief replied.
The "Made in America" event was declared by the White House as an official event and was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the president made efforts to advance the health care reform that was then in the Senate’s drafting, and praised attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as “Marine One” and “Air Force One” for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But to ask them only in the interests of photo-opportunity is unusual.
Trump was already the subject of discussions in February, when the presidential plane drove in the background during his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was inundated with messages complaining about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
“The White House is thrilled with the Made in America show, which featured products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsey Walters said in a statement.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights around the Washington agglomeration and on the South Lawn to train the President of the United States to the White House with an accuracy of an inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one official, the flight performed for the Made in America event was credited to the crew for the required training flights for the month.
The unit’s helicopters also flew 11 extra hours that day as part of “non-presidential support tasks.”
According to the White House, taxpayers were not charged for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A Sikorsky representative said the company did not take part in the organization of the demonstration of the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep a budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But, according to the Defense Department’s hourly rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the Defense Department’s reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit's records show that the aircraft's time in the air was 30 minutes each way from its airfield based at Quantico Marine Corps Air Base in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using a helicopter is much lower than this rate.
“Calculating the cost to taxpayers based on an approximate reimbursement rate is completely wrong,” Walters says.
“These indicative rates include staffing, maintenance and many other irreversible costs that are included in the annual appropriations.”
According to a 2015 study by RAND Corporation, reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do account for the cost of fuel, maintenance, and costs specified in the contract.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer spoke out in favor of using the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to showcase things made in America this week,” Spicer said.
And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to create.
Therefore, of course, it is quite appropriate to pay attention to this.”
It was unclear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter while inspecting the South Lawn during the event, but he did sit in the driver’s seat in the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky, joking with the press about his own fleet of products of the company.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” the president said, “I have three of them.”
Moscow will allocate grants for resuscitation departments of city hospitals
Annually, "Save Life" grants will be allocated to intensive care units and intensive care units of the capital's medical clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin visited the Yudin City Clinical Hospital.
During the examination of the clinic, he handed a thank you letter to the traumatologist-orthopedist Viktor Protsko, under the guidance of which the most complex operation to reconstruct the foot of a teenager was carried out.
Sergey Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to annually allocate grants to intensive care units of city clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the mayor of the capital, the Yudin Clinical Hospital is one of the largest in Moscow.
In recent years, the clinic received new modern equipment that allows its doctors to conduct unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of Kolomna Rural Hospital.
Currently, the departments of the medical institution are designed to receive more than a thousand patients.
In addition to intensive care and the hospital, there are day departments.
The hospital employs 2,800 people.
The total area occupied by the medical clinic is 23.7 hectares.
In February of this year, the medical institution became a participant in the pilot project on the organization of short-term inpatients.
They are designed for relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical interventions, advanced medical equipment is used, which allows to significantly reduce the rehabilitation time of patients.
After the operation in the hospital, they spend only a few hours.
In the first half of this year alone, 36,000 patients received inpatient care at the Yudin Clinical Hospital.
The medical staff of the clinic performed 15,800 operations of varying complexity.
NBU reported on the absence of buyers of the Ukrainian “daughter” of Sberbank
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported on the absence of applications for the purchase of the Ukrainian “daughter” of Sberbank.
About it on Friday, August 4, reports TASS with reference to the representative of the press service of the NBU.
The NBU confirms that on August 3, 2017, a package of documents from the citizen of Belarus and Cyprus Viktor Prokopeni to agree on the indirect (through Paritetbank) acquisition of 100 percent of Sberbank shares was withdrawn.
“Documents from other potential investors for the purchase of shares of Sberbank in the NBU has not been received”, – stated in the message.
On August 3, Belarusian businessman Viktor Prokopenya withdrew his application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
On July 28, it became known that the National Bank of Ukraine refused Russian businessmen Said Gutseriev and Grigory Guselnikov in the acquisition of the Ukrainian “daughter” of Sberbank.
The regulator justified its decision by the fact that businessmen did not provide the necessary documents for verification of their compliance with the requirements of the legislation of Ukraine.
Sberbank announced the sale of its Ukrainian “daughter” consortium Norvik Banka and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Said Gutseriev, the son of Russian businessman Mikhail Gutseriev.
Sanctions against the subsidiaries of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
During the year, they are forbidden to withdraw capital from the country in favor of parent organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, the UN said.
The elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, participate in them, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
According to Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overstated,” he said in a statement Wednesday.
Choices can be fully representative only when women participate fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
Provincial council elections and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on April 5.
The Taliban is threatening to disrupt the election process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to the role of advisers.
In this year’s elections, power is shifting peacefully from one democratically elected government to another for the first time.
Haysom said that increasing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.

In Venice, tightened fines for tourists for inappropriate behavior
Venice has tightened the fines for swimming in the canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
For walking around the city in a swimsuit or with a naked torso will now be fined 200 euros.
100 euros will be required from those who organize a picnic in a public place or ride a bicycle in pedestrian areas, reports TASS with reference to the Association of tour operators of Russia.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities provide a fine for inscriptions on monuments 400 euros and for garbage 25 euros.
To inform tourists about the need to comply with the rules of conduct in Venice will be with the help of a special company "Enjoy, respect Venice" (#EnjoyRespectVenezia) in social networks, as well as through ads and posters on the website of the city council, on billboards and in the places of the largest concentration of tourists.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to Venice Tourism Advisor Paola Mar, information about fines will be transferred to the embassies of the home countries of the offenders in order to warn their compatriots against such mistakes.
“The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach,” she said.
In April, the administration of the Italian city announced plans to limit the tourist flow.
Venice has already successfully implemented a limit on the number of tourists visiting the city center.
Instead of 100,000 people wanting to watch the Festa del Redentore festival, only 60,000 guests were allowed to the venue.
In addition, a moratorium on the creation of new hotels and fast food restaurants in the historical part of Venice has been introduced.

Electricity is cheaper for both residents and producers of Buryatia
The efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
From September 1, the cost of low-voltage electricity for industrial recipients is reduced by 25%.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country in accordance with the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation "On Amendments to the Rules of the Wholesale Market of Electricity and Power and to the Consolidated Forecast Balance of Production and Supply of Electricity (Power) within the Unified Energy System of Russia by Subjects of the Russian Federation" (from 17.07.2017 No. 842) has established indicative prices for electricity and power by the Buryats of the Republic.
As a result, the cost of electricity for Buryat commodity producers is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate the life of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the republic beat the thresholds of the Moscow cabinets in vain attempts to level the region in tariffs with the neighboring Irkutsk region with a cascade of hydroelectric power plants on the Angara, flowing from Baikal, the main catchment area for which is Buryatia.
It was only this year that the movement began.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the republic were reduced from 4.24 rubles/kWh to 3.93 rubles/kWh, or by 7.3%.
With the inclusion of Buryatia by the decision of the federal government in the List of territories of the price zones of the wholesale market, for which the features of the functioning of the wholesale and retail markets are established, the turn of industrial consumers has come.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, since the population of the Irkutsk region pays for a kilowatt / hour of 1.01 rubles.
But no one dares to name at least an approximate date of new tariff moves towards a decrease for Buryatia.

The National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Boiler Workers (GMB) is concerned about the investment at McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The union is demanding guarantees from managers of McVitie’s biscuit maker over its long-term production commitment at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish branch of GMB reports that the company has silently bypassed the issue of future investments at the Tolcross facility.
The factory, which produces, among other products, Hobnobs cookies and Rich Tea, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie’s, says it has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the facility over the past few years.
The company adds that in the event of any changes in the operation of the facility, employees and representatives of the trade union "will be the first to know about them."
In a letter to the head of the facility owned by the company, the Scottish branch of GMB demanded from McVitie's response to concerns that funding would not be allowed to upgrade production lines.
Senior organiser Drew Duffy said: “The members of our union are deeply concerned that we cannot get clarity from the general manager of the facility on business needs and the investment plan for the future of Tolcross.”
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is great in local society and in the territory of Greater Glasgow; it is the most important pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages, and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising subsistence levels, and chronic declines in production, East End Glasgow is in desperate need of a thriving McVitie’s factory.
“The head of the Tolcross facility just yesterday received a letter from the Scottish branch of GMB and the company will respond immediately as we value our ongoing collaboration with the union’s employees and representatives.”
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tolcross with GMB staff and representatives, where we openly discussed a number of issues.
We talked to employees about the fact that, like all companies operating in the most competitive and unstable economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions - and this applies to all our facilities and activities - in order to remain competitive.
“In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in our Tolcross facility, especially in production lines and improved functional performance.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a manufacturing facility, and in the event of any changes to the work at this facility, employees and union representatives will be the first to know.”
Putin said that the authorities will not give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers should be involved in the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petrochemical Company (VNKhK), but no one will give instructions to Gazprom, as well as Rosneft.
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin’s request to help resolve the contradictions.
The head of state drew attention to the fact that relations between Rosneft and Gazprom should be decided solely on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft Igor Sechin at a meeting on the implementation of major investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District said that the lack of an agreement with Gazprom on gas for VNHC jeopardizes the implementation of the project.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue continues.
"Gazprom offers to find gas resources from the perimeter of Rosneft, but we do not have such resources," Sechin said.
Recall that Rosneft asked to allow it to use gas from the Kirinskoye field of Gazprom, located on the Sakhalin shelf, for the Eastern Petrochemical Company.
In June, Gazprom said that negotiations on this issue are ongoing, and “there are no sharp corners there.”
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar’s move three years ago?
A member of the “La Liga” may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not stop pursuing Neymar after the club offered <0xC2><0xA3>189 million for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona of a world record-breaking raid three years ago?
The sensational offer revived the summer transfer window when Ligue 1 club was ready to break the world record for the cost of transition, more than twice the previous mark associated with the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester United last season for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million.
When the transition is complete, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world, as well as the highest paid professional athlete in the world, as PSG offers him a salary of more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 a week net.
It is known that “Barcelona” and rage at how the proposal was made, and how Neymar broke the contract, despite the fact that, as insists a source close to the leadership of the Catalan club, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his transition from Santos in 2013.
But wasn’t the football world warned of this possibility three years ago by PSG’s president?
When Manchester City expressed interest in hiring Blaise Mathewidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a stern warning to any club looking to lure one of PSG’s top players.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we’re going to go up against them, we’re going to make offers to their players,” he said.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, there will be consequences.”
Barcelona seem to have crossed that line when the Spanish club expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG has made it clear that it will not release the Italian national team player on any terms, and now Barcelona is probably feeling the consequences of its offer in the form of the loss of one of its most valuable players, Neymar.
Putin instructed to deal with payments to victims of forest fires.
Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed to understand the material assistance that is allocated to residents affected by forest fires and the construction of new housing.
Today I would like to hear how the work is going.
In particular, I ask you to report on the situation with payments and compensation to injured citizens.
I have a bit of a discrepancy.
“On this occasion, I would also like to ask the relevant colleagues about how much money has been allocated,” Putin said at a meeting with leaders of the regions located on Lake Baikal.
On August 4, Vladimir Putin visited the Baikal State Natural Biosphere Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by the Plenipotentiary Representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Siberian Federal District Sergey Menyaylo and the Head of the Baikal Branch of the Glavrybvod Federal State Bank Leonid Mikhailik.
They talked about the work on cleaning the lake.
Then the fry were shown in an open container next to the container, which was prepared for breeding.
At first, Putin let a few kids out of the bag.
Then he pulled a special lever on the lid of the container and released the others.
Also during the trip, the leader instructed to deal with the environmental situation on Lake Baikal and build a road on the island of Olkhon.
According to the Ministry of Construction, one volume is needed, and another volume is allegedly provided.
“I want to deal with this, in fact, what is happening there with funding,” the Russian leader stressed.
We will remind, in the course of forest fires in 2017, the fire covered the settlements of Buryatia, Irkutsk region, residential buildings and outbuildings were destroyed.

The project is focused on the HoReCa segment, retail and offices.
In Russia, there will be two new territories of advanced socio-economic development - "Abaza" and "Novotroitsk".
The relevant decrees of the Government of the Russian Federation will enter into force today, August 4.
The boundaries and types of economic activity of TOR in the territory of the city of Abaza in the Republic of Khakassia are determined.
In the city, where 15 thousand people live, there will be a special legal regime of entrepreneurial activity, as well as a minimum amount of capital investments of residents, a minimum number of new permanent jobs.
It is expected that this will attract about 2.5 billion rubles of investment to the city, and more than 600 new jobs will be created.
The list of economic activities in which Abaza will operate a special legal regime of entrepreneurial activity, for example, includes crop production, livestock, food production, soft drinks and clothing.
Already, the Government of the Republic has signed framework agreements on the implementation of 8 investment projects.
It is also planned to reduce the dependence of the territory on the city-forming enterprise LLC "Abakan mine".
In January 2017, the authorities of the region reported that Khakassia fulfilled all the conditions of the Ministry of Economic Development for the creation of the TOP.
Similarly, the authorities of the Orenburg region did the same.
There, in the city of Novotroitsk, a territory of advanced socio-economic development will also be created.
This will allow to diversify the economy of the monotown, reduce its dependence on the city-forming enterprise of JSC "Ural steel", as well as create more than 2.3 thousand jobs and attract investments in the amount of more than 8 billion rubles.
The list of economic activities, in which the new TOP will have a special legal regime for entrepreneurs, includes, in particular, freshwater fish farming, the production of feed, medicines and medical materials.
Novotroitsk became the first of the monotowns of the Orenburg region to receive the status of TOR.
The territory of advanced development is an economic zone with preferential tax conditions, simplified administrative procedures and other privileges, which is created to attract investment to improve the life of the population.
Among the benefits for residents of the TOP, the following can be distinguished: a profit tax of no more than 5% for the first five years, and at least 10% for the next 5 years, social contributions in the amount of 7.6% for 10 years, the use of the free customs zone regime, a preferential mode of connection to various infrastructure facilities, as well as preferential rental rates.
Vine called Manson a "poison" and threatened to "put him in the face"

In an interview with “Komsomolskaya Pravda”, the Russian singer called Manson “vile” and “poor”.
According to Loza, foreign artists who allow themselves to make such statements do not need to be invited to Russia.
In addition, Loza believes that Manson for his words need to "put in the face."
We will remind, the American artist, known for his outrageous actions, rudely spoke about the Russian capital at a concert in Kiev.
Earlier on Thursday, “Arguments of the week” wrote that Manson’s statement was commented on by domestic producer Joseph Prigozhin.
