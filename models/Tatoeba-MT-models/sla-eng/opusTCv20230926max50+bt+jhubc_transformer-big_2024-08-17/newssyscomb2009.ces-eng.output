Austria's right-wing populists win 29%
The appreciable weakening of both sides of the previous grand coalition and the significant strengthening of right-wing populist parties brought early parliamentary elections in Austria, according to the first preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP) suffered particularly heavy losses, where the position of the current chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously shaken.
In contrast, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), Carinthian Governor J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, it remains the strongest party in the country of social democracy (SP<0xC3><0x96>) with 29.8% of the vote, but it loses 5.5% of the vote against the last elections in 2006.
Even worse was the <0xC3><0x96>VP, which lost by 25.6% to almost 9% of the vote.
These are the worst results of both of these major parties in Austrian post-war history, and especially for the People's Party, which triggered the early elections, a literally disastrous result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP withdrew from the coalition, the People’s Party had a significant advantage over the SP<0xC3><0x96>.
But voters have clearly punished them for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party’s chairman and former Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party's bureau.
Such a development would probably facilitate the path to the still most likely outcome of the election, i.e. the renewal of the grand coalition of SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP.
However, due to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Free Party (FP<0xC3><0x96>) received a preliminary 18 percent and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> 11 percent of the vote - the Social Democrats also expressed concern about the repetition of 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (at that time the FP<0xC3><0x96> was still united, in 2005 even broke away from the BZ<0xC3><0x96> party) on a common government.
This development is clearly supported by Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and envisages a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party also got into the parliament, but it was slightly lost and fell among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
None of the other parties apparently crossed the 4% threshold and did not get into parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India could cool off
If the problem with Czech scientists accused of illegally collecting beetles in India could not be solved, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, there would be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister made the remarks in New York after meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee, today.
"If this is not resolved, then yes, then there would be a certain cooling," he said after the meeting, which took place on the basis of a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the hearing that it would be difficult for the executive branch to intervene in judicial matters.
However, he said that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government in Darjeeling, whose jurisdiction the case falls under.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherjee said it would be best for him to appeal to a higher court.
He can then apply for bail and wait for the verdict to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed the same during the meeting.
"He recommends appealing to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him," the Czech foreign minister said.
The only way the Czech side can get involved in the whole matter is to provide “competent legal support” to the convicts, the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that the Indian side is already providing such assistance to them.
“We have the utmost interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians recognize that too," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a profound mistake to imprison and impeach these Czech scientists," he said.
The minister avoided answering the question of whether he had received a promise from the Indian side to deal with the matter.
"I've made quite a few promises," he said.
Czech Republic judges the fight for the seabed
It will proceed to a wall-mounted electronic map showing Australia and adjacent marine areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia, and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said Luigi Santosuosso, an Italian lawyer who is part of the 30-member team of staff from the UN Division of Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
Its head, the director of the division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and occasionally completes it.
There is a working spirit and enthusiasm.
The seabed hides a little-known world, rich in natural resources.
Oil, ores and other minerals can be found here, as well as previously unknown living organisms that hold the key to developing a cure for cancer.
Deeper than the mainland
Coastal states today began to vehemently apply for new underwater territories.
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCLOS) was signed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly an area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the country.
It shall have exclusive rights under the Convention to all resources of the continental shelf.
"Simply put, the continental shelf is that part of the seabed and its subsoil which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the boundaries of the coastal sea, often beyond the two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone,” Mikulka explains.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the delimitation of the outer limits of the continental shelf must be supported by a comprehensive scientific and technical dossier based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical assistance.
The Commission has so far examined five applications, namely from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only three of the last mentioned countries have succeeded," Mikulka adds.
The success of Australia, which was the first to significantly expand its undersea countries, has recently been noticed worldwide.
But New Zealand has also gained - the area of the seabed, which the commission admitted to him last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the survey.
The profits that will flow from the use of the seabed in the future will be, as they promise, invaluable.
Other countries will also submit their applications gradually.
They can do so up to ten years after ratifying the “Montego Bay Convention”.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor, declared by convention to be the "common heritage of mankind", begins.
No country has an exclusive status here.
The right to extract in this area is granted by a convention established by an international institution.
"But the seabed is not a Klondike," says the exaggeration director Mikulka, adding that his "individual areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contractually anchored."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, it received the status of a so-called "ground-breaking investor" under the Convention, as well as investors from a few other states.
It is authorised to mine in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is dissected, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatras.
"It is possible to mine there on an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich deposit of polymetallic nodules containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
A Macedonian employee of the Robert Sandev division brings one such concretion to the fore.
It resembles a small potato or, with a little imagination, a mythical scheme that, according to legend, revived Golem.
German special forces were on the scene when the hostages were released.
The Egyptian government has asked for help in resolving the hostage crisis in Germany - experts have arrived.
When the situation escalated, the special forces were ready, but there was no deployment.
Further details of the circumstances surrounding the release of 11 kidnapped European tourists in Egypt are gradually being released to the public.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to the ministries, both experts of the Federal Army and members of the anti-terrorist group of the German police GSG9, pilots of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and also logistics experts from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk) were on the scene.
According to another statement from the two ministries on Monday afternoon, however, there was no need for German forces because the kidnappers let their captives go and fled when they recognized signs of forced liberation.
The Egyptian government has said it has accepted the aid offered by Germany as a support force for action on the ground.
"Fortunately, that didn't happen," said one of the interior ministry spokespersons.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and eight of their Egyptian guides on September 19 in southern Egypt.
After the abduction, hostages were moved to the southern desert region of Egypt in the border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment, as did the details of the release or possible payment of the ransom.
Rescue operations are currently underway in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said the release of the hostages was in the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
There is no word yet on when the rescue will return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", all five tourists should fly with special forces one of the Airbuses of the German Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress let the $700 billion rescue package for the financial markets fall by a narrow majority.
The Dow Jones index fell sharply.
By a vote of 206 to 227, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all the calls from US President George W. Bush and top politicians on both sides, a majority was not found for a program that should ease the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic move, supporters have been desperate to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, called for the MPs to give their consent before the vote, although, as he put it, the plan is not popular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
During the voting period, the Dow Jones fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for this was investors’ fears that the state rescue package could fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index rose in order to fall sharply after the announcement of the crash of the package.
Experts are now counting on other serious turbulence in the international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, the consent of the House of Representatives and the Senate is required.
Travel Agents Record Increasing Numbers of Reservations
It seems that winter will be good for German entrepreneurs in tourism:
According to one study, travel bookings for the coming months increased significantly in turnover compared to the previous year – by even more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic growth, the desire of Germans to travel remains undiminished.
For bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the same period last year, as the German Travel Association (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) said on Monday in Berlin.
According to a survey by the market research institute GfK, increased bookings are already available for the autumn months.
According to DRV, the turnover in October was about eleven percent higher compared to 2007.
These results are based on GfK figures, which evaluates booking data from 1,200 German travel agencies every month and interpolates it into the overall market.
This result included bookings of tours that took place until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, travel to the United States is especially in demand, DRV said.
For these trips, the increase in bookings makes about one-third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters, are particularly desirable targets for the Germans.
Especially organized tours are in the course, said DRV Chairman Klaus Laeple.
In view of the rising costs of energy and food, the costs here are "more calculable for the client than for an individually organised holiday".
Laeple explained that money can be saved by consumers, among other things, by using early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of bookings was said to be very good, so there will again be a higher turnover compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who took some sort of trip fell compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
An endlessly repeated ash, beer from thugs and prominents in costumes from well-known designers.
First time in a beer garden.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's blonde, she's a TV presenter, and she wears a tailor-made outfit.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing unites us: we are not even three minutes in the beer field yet, and photographers are already rushing at us and swiftly filling memory cards - that's flattering, because this is my first time at Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
It seems my cheap suit has served its purpose.
I am here as a tourist and live north of the sausage equator, so my sense of comfort in the costume was rather limited.
But right after arriving at Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone wears a women's suit or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is completely normal.
My apron is the only one that gets special looks at the banana stand in chocolate.
A nun reminds me that I have tied her up badly: "You are free on the left, in the middle of the virgin, entered on the right, widowed on the back."
Secretly, I'll switch the bow from the back to the left.
"All right," he says, laughing.
Others do not deal with subtle flirting techniques so much and wear simple felt hats with the inscription "To drink to get dressed!" and poke their naked butts at passers-by.
A young man with such exhibitionistic tendencies, his name is Bob, he is from England and he also came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
He thinks it's "gorgeous" with an elongated "ooh."
That's what he's telling me after he's relieved you've just had a few drinks.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks are trash cans.
So Bob is one of the feared "Wildbieslers," as people in Bavaria call themselves when they urinate in public.
Others are lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening they run around the area where the Oktoberfest is held, swarming with medics who have to take care of the poor drinkers.
Paramedics always appear in flocks - in four they wear covered stretchers from tent to tent.
They work like most visitors to the beer meadows: empty there, full back again.
Who lies under the tarpaulin of this coffin of promills is not seen.
"It's the ones that can't go on," one of the paramedics calls me to answer my question and disappears into the crowd.
Police released the name of the victim of the accident
The name of a 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a car in Essex has been released.
An accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon struck Carole Paulson from Chelmsford Road.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He's already been released on police bail.
Turkey's diplomatic horizons widened
Long before Turkey began its bid to join the European Union, the European powers wanted to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the east bank of the Bosphorus, perhaps just twenty steps in Asia, stands one of the finest monuments of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpa<0xC5><0xA1>a railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
A tourist guide will tell you that.
The building sits in a circle at the end of the platform with a tower on each corner of the facade, looking indistinguishable from some provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slowly falling apart.
But once one gets inside the vaulted cash register, one can no longer doubt the size of the enterprise whose westernmost gate was the station.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium of the Anatolian-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, which was late in the game of empires, intended to realize its ambitions for the control of the Middle East with the help of this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and further on in the territory that is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany’s imperial ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
Their dormitories were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular units.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
British and colonial troops marched out of Egypt and drove the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hydarpa<0xC5><0xA1>a Station as well.
In 1917, an explosion of an ammunition train destroyed its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, they have gradually crumbled and history has bypassed them.
Today, however, this gateway to Anatolia and further east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
Now a new policy is being implemented - Turkey is engaging.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I boarded a night train to the Turkish capital Ankara, where I was to meet one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a curvy ride on the tracks that recalled the old-world rhythms of the famous Night Post, I arrived in the Turkish capital, designed as a new city for a secular state that wants to turn its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
It has aroused suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi brought me to the AKP's main tent, an ultra-modern stone and metal building, purposely built on a sprawling suburb, surrounded by half-built department stores and power shops, where middle managers in business suits - both men and women - meet to make early morning deals.
Suat Kiniklioglu could well be a middle-right politician from almost any other European political party.
Jacket, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate surroundings.
“The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey was cut off from its own land.
We have to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
He had to do both.
"But there will come a time," I asked, "when Turkey may have to make a decision?"
"Turkey," he said, "didn't want such a decision to have to happen."
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to said almost by heart: Turkey’s relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea region are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, follow these tracks east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpa<0xC5><0xA1>a Station, after another long night, I thought of the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Con, who had watched the building being built a hundred years ago.
How would they be surprised to learn that European ambitions in the Middle East could now be, in large part, in Turkish hands?
And when I was waiting at the port for the ferry back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least then there was not much doubt as to which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
Memorable Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford Music Director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (obituary, September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the district music plan, he founded a year-long excellent choir of young Proteus.
He was supposed to be 21 years old, but by the time Proteus sang for the last time in 1979, a few of us were almost 30 — we just refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shape-shifter) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to engage in any music presented to it - whether madrigals or Messiaen, either alone or with the whole orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young choir was often overwhelming, always exciting, and all thanks to the inspiration of that one man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely unchanged all the time.
How often has Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself"?
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
Sing it then! "
His tactics were clear and precise, but they were neither dictatorial nor flowery.
Wherever there was a standard of music, it always raised it.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor was to be knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well for two decades, when he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
I’ve reviewed over 100 of his concerts over the last 40 years, and I can honestly say that I’ve never been disappointed by any of them – and I’ve been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors, who, in his words, simply "dragged one or two seeps around the world."
Many of us will be missed.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary by William Woodruff (September 25) states that "in 1946 he returned to economic history at Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher at the Houblon-Norman ... while also studying for the BSc, MA and PhD".
This is based on Woodruff's note to the author in Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time completed a dissertation on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as a publication on the British rubber industry.
He actually spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at the Hubble-Norman and the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham for Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff went through this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Arts
“I recommend José Vicente Resina’s exhibition Flamenco and Life because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
They captivated me with the simplicity and strong charge with which they act on the audience, and with the consideration and respect for the photographed.
An exhibition that shows a lot of emotion.
Resino can capture magical moments."
Honda to attack for second time with its best-seller
In November, Honda will start selling the second-generation Jazz.
If the predecessor of this single-space vehicle already had a considerable space, now it offers an even more spacious interior.
This is accompanied by improved engines that increase driving comfort and allow for greater fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view, the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes on this one-dimensional car.
It is necessary to mention, for example, innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Even before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes to the market six years after the launch of the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing to note is the fact that Honda needed a shorter period of time to rejuvenate this model than other manufacturers.
Although in Europe Jazz is a less well-known model, in other markets it has become a phenomenon in sales.
This is the case in Japan, the country where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and also during this year 2008.
Almost a million units have been sold in Japan since the launch of the Honda Jazz.
The second market became the old continent with about half a million units sold in six years.
Honda, however, aims for the new Jazz to increase sales in its category.
While the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of Honda Jazz in 2007, an estimated 100,000 cars were sold in 2009, an increase of 17% in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of the Jazz model since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects to sell 2,000 units for the whole year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, the company expects the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which means 4,000 fewer than in 2007 and a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share of the Spanish market to 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
In 2010, the Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
In order for Honda to achieve this share, it relies on the success of its next new model.
It is the Honda Insight, a five-door hybrid compact size with a length of 4.37 meters, from which the Japanese company promises worldwide sales of about 200,000 units per year.
In terms of markets, the Japanese manufacturer estimates that 50% of Insight will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the old continent and Japan.
The launch of the Honda Insight is expected in the first months of next year, once it is presented to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, all dimensions of the new Jazz have increased.
Its length increased to 3.9 meters (five centimeters more), width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and wheelbase to 2.5 meters, which means an extension of five centimeters.
The height has not changed and is still 1.52 meters.
By increasing the dimensions, the interior space was also increased.
This advantage was achieved both by using a new platform and by placing a fuel tank in the middle of the car, which had already been used on the previous Honda Jazz.
Also, the luggage compartment volume – which features a double-bottom system – has increased to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the luggage compartment volume of the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur in the version with the 1.4 engine, since the luggage compartment volume of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
In addition to the exterior elements - such as the rear LED lights or the possibility of equipping with a glazed panoramic roof - it is easier to access the rear seats.
The doors leading to the second row of seats allow an opening angle of 80 degrees compared to 67 on the first Jazz model.
The second-generation Honda Jazz has new engines.
Initially, this small model will be offered with two petrol engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which allows for lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and brings excellent improvements to the drive system at the same time with high torque in the full engine speed range.
The first 1.2-litre engine has a power output of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which had 78 hp in the previous generation Jazz - consumes 5.3 liters and emits 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it will now reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with a power of 100 hp has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
"Car Bee" Prevents Collisions
To advance the development of technologies to protect against accidents, Nissan this time inspired in nature, specifically in bees.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes the pattern of flying bees, thus preventing collisions.
Such is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at the Nissan Motor Co. Centre for Technological Progress have developed the robot in collaboration with the Centre for Advances in Scientific and Technological Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, General Manager of Public Relations for Technology, Research and Brand Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan’s four safety shield zones.
The robot is designed to strengthen the ability to prevent collisions in cars of this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
However, the most important are the compound bee eyes, which are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, which allows the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
When creating this visual feature, the engineers designed what they called a Laser Range Finder.
It records obstacles that are up to two meters within a 180-degree radius of the BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately converts it to a collision warning.
"The moment an obstacle is detected, the robot mimics the bee's movements and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to the right or even a larger angle to prevent a collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is the fact that all evasive maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the robot cannot move up and down or diagonally; its movement is limited to only two dimensions and the direction in which it is allowed to rotate its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities, as in bees.
In addition to acceleration and deceleration, Nissan also used the rotation function to prevent collisions.
“The device only needs to process the information every few seconds and to be preserved according to this data.
It does not require the storage of information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, thanks to which it can work without interruption with only two dozen kB of memory.
It may surprise you, but in memory we don’t talk about gigs or megas.”
This is the first step in the development of new crash prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan predicts will be used in production cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the integration of the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the driver to the destination and avoid obstacles on the way.
Enjoy the fear before you take out a mortgage
It should be recognized that the US Treasury, in addition to having enough capital to distribute injections, does not lack inventiveness.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking out risky mortgages at banks with questionable solvency, she created the popular educational game "Bad Credit Hotel" on the Internet.
It wasn't a bad credit hotel... or a messy hotel.
The hotel and especially its receptionists look gloomy, so that a person once, twice or three times changed his mind whether it was the right time to apply for a loan.
And above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, albeit not very detailed.
It is a site suitable for young people rather than a space for the general public.
What happens when the game ends?
A dream room will appear inside the hotel.
At least something, because it's better not to talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s largest bank, is entering its midst, spending $9 billion to raise 21% of its capital. The adoption of this report was accompanied by a significant drop in its exchange rate.
A week after they revealed their preliminary agreement, both banks explained that MUFG plans to buy 9.9 percent of Morgan Stanley’s common stock at a single price of $25.25, a total of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as of August 31.
MUFG is investing an additional $6 billion in convertible securities, which will provide it with a 10% return and an exchange price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the entire operation would take place on the basis of an average unit price of $29, or 28% below its current exchange rate.
Morgan Stanley's shares were still down 6.79% to $23.07 at around 5 p.m.
“This strategic merger represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to a banking holding company,” said John Mack, Group CEO.
The new statute was adopted by Morgan Stanley last week to allow it to diversify its activities, but it also places it under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Its merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street’s biggest ace to take a far more cautious approach than before.
The terms unveiled on Monday show, among other things, that the deal has been amended over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for around $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, we thought," Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG's chief executive, explained in Tokyo, "that our participation would consist exclusively of ordinary shares.
However, given the current state of the economy and the market, we wanted to keep the risks to a minimum and also to cover ourselves."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay for Morgan Stanley securities 7 % less than their book value.
And the operation will result in a reduction in earnings per share of about 20%.
The agreement envisages that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares within a year, if the latter are exchanged for a certain period at a price exceeding the exchange price by 50%, i.e. for about $ 47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that MUFG will bring will allow it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its cash.
However, the group's spokesperson declined to provide further details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following the investment by MUFG, Morgan Stanley should boast a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15 %, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he had "tangibly" cut his balance since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, as its exchange rate has fallen by half, while the insurance costs against the risk of non-payment associated with debt have risen sharply.
On Monday, these costs took the opposite turn, but remained high, at around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of Wall Street’s big investment banks after the Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers crash and the Merrill Lynch buyout, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
To re-establish a republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
Such is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
Last Sunday, the third nominee put to the vote, following the example of his counterparts and friends, a draft of a new Constitution.
And his mission is fulfilled, because 64% of voters, according to official results covering 80% of the vote, voted "yes" in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% of the votes received "no", 7% were invalid and 0.7% of the ballots were empty.
In order to pass the bill, he had to get half the votes plus one.
Two polls conducted in the east of the polling stations and a calculation by NGOs predicted a clear "yes" victory on Sunday, placing them in the range of 63% to 70%.
Rafael Correa, on the other hand, demanded the victory of his draft Constitution on the night of Sunday to Monday.
"The Constitution has won," he assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians at Guayaquil, 280 kilometres southwest of Quito.
It goes without saying that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chavez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which, according to the Organization of American States (OEA) observation mission, took place quietly, concerned the text on 444 points building the "new socialism" promoted by the president.
The draft Constitution sanctifies the power of the state over the economy by depriving it of "development planning" of a country living primarily on oil extraction by foreign companies and on foreign exchange sent by its emigrants.
The proposal, backed by Correa, who was elected in 2006, also expands the powers of the head of state, who will be able to serve two consecutive four-year terms and be able to dissolve the chamber.
Correa has already announced that it will use this power and will seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The constitution, among other things, reinforces the principle of free health care and education that the president has begun to implement in a country of 13.9 million people, where 50 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also envisages a ban on the presence of foreign troops, thus ending the agreement between Washington and Quito on the use of the Ecuadorian base as the starting point of US drug operations.
19 hostages have been freed in Chad.
An Egyptian commando carried out an attack on the hijackers of 11 tourists and their eight-member escort, who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held captive in the desert for 10 days, were transported alive and well to the Egyptian capital on Monday.
In the morning, an Egyptian commando liberated them in Chad.
The hostages arrived around 3:30 p.m., apparently in good form, aboard a special aircraft to al-Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transported, without being able to speak in the press, on board a helicopter to a hospital in Maadi, a suburb of Cairo’s residential district, to undergo medical examinations.
“They are perfectly healthy” and “no ransom has been paid to the hijackers,” Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheyr Garrana said on the airport’s runway.
Since their capture on September 19, during a four-wheel-drive safari at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages has been dragged from one hideout to another by 35 unknown hijackers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard director of the Aegyptous agency, the organisers of the safari.
A senior Egyptian security official has suggested that 30 special forces members who approached the site on board two helicopters went on a rampage during the night just before dawn.
"There was a shootout, half the kidnappers were killed and the others fled," said the source, who wished to remain anonymous.
He indicated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the “flash” unit were sent to Sudan, where they received the support of German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy, Franco Frattini, from Belgrade, where he is now, mentioned the role played by secret agents and Italian special forces.
“We have to recognize that we achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of people from our intelligence services, special forces,” he said.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
On the eve of the raid, the Sudanese army said it had detained a four-wheel-drive vehicle carrying hijackers, killing six including the Chadian commander and arresting two others.
The army claimed they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement - Unity (SLA-U), which immediately rejected the movement.
Letters - The Silent Majority of the Ministry of Culture
The debate on the financing of culture fills the pages of newspapers with headlines and is the subject of an ongoing election campaign.
All the better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise up to extort the poor sums that are provided to small museums, archives, archaeological digs, and national monuments that are dying of hunger?
Which politician dares remind the federal government that they are neglecting their monuments and their historic buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don’t have laws that actually protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is devoting three and a half million euros to the restoration of the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
It is written in the Constitution of our American neighbors that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage should be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all regional organizations, in cooperation.
In Québec, a federation of societies for the history of Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers affiliated with 211 societies for history, monuments, archives and genealogy are seeking to uncover history, preserve a pile of private archives, and protect archaeological remains for a few pennies.
Often, these companies are the watchdogs of our monuments, driven by hopelessness, protesting when promoters and leaders drop their bulldozers on old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will we finally see the grandstands for history and monuments?
Government of Benelux State Bank Fortis
The Benelux countries will help Fortis, the Belgian-Dutch bank that was the first in Europe to get into trouble due to the growing impact of the US mortgage market crisis, with a partial nationalisation: the three countries will support a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion money and insurance institution, which also has a capital stake in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed at the highest level, with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Fortis is the first bank in the euro area to be hit by a major crisis in the context of a crisis of international financial markets, which has been spreading in waves for more than a year, and the decisions taken on this matter could be seen as precedents from a certain point of view.
According to the decision, which was born on Sunday night, all three states will buy almost half (49 percent) of the bank’s assets there.
The bank is confident that it will sell some of its equity holdings, most notably - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from Dutch bank ABN Amro.
The shares of Fortis Bank began to fall sharply last week, and in the second half of the week there were already serious signs of a crisis in the institution.
But analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to fail.
The company's securities fell 12 percent on Friday alone, to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the current share prices, the total market capital value of the group is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company’s leaders, this is unrealistic.
The company blames the fall of Fortis shares on the uncertainty in the overseas market associated with the adoption of the plan of the US package worth $ 700 billion.
On Monday, the shares rose slightly.
On Friday, a new CEO, Filip Dierckx, was appointed to head the bank.
The Money Institute was also looking for private buyers, but no one has yet come forward with a more serious offer.
The Belgian government has already announced that investors do not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
There has been no panic among the bank’s clients and the branches have not been taken by the attack.
Fortis has a separate branch in Hungary and has also acquired several leasing companies.
Fox in the henhouse
Life and health insurance companies in America, based on people's data on the purchase of medicines, often reject the possibility of concluding an insurance contract with the applicant.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection program that binds the use of prescription data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
It must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we entrust the chicken coop to the fox,” Richard Dick, the author of a program designed to monitor drug prescriptions, told the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make insurance premiums and amounts paid in the case of insurance events dependent on the health status of the interested parties, and if the risk is assessed as too large, they will not even conclude insurance with it.
They used to send the people in question for medical examinations and only concluded the contract when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the identification number, a customer from pharmacies can easily find out what drugs he bought in the last year and a half, from which the program itself deduces what kind of disease he suffers from and what his state of health is.
For example, if he regularly buys a large amount of cholesterol-lowering drugs, this indicates that he has virtually uncontrollable high blood fat levels, which immediately puts him in a category with a higher risk.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some of which determine the risk ratio at the same time, so the insurance company has almost no work left besides paperwork, although minor difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include the fact that several drugs can be used for several purposes, some compounds, for example, are useful against migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
From the point of view of commercial insurance companies, these represent a significant risk-increasing factor, whereas the aforementioned difficulties do not.
In order to request and process data, special companies have been created, which, before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, will ask the patient for permission.
The authorities are now forcing them to do so, even though they have not been punished for their negligence.
Recently, some companies have been processing the results of laboratory tests, which they combine with data on the drugs used, thanks to which they can provide an even more accurate picture of the health of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, while controlling their use will become increasingly difficult.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, but its effectiveness applies only to health service providers and insurance companies.
The bill, which will give authorities the power to control even companies specializing in providing data, is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: he has therefore developed his programme in such a way that the transfer of data is subject to the explicit consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that the permission in question can hardly refuse, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with it.
So the hens are still somewhat reliant on the leaf of good will.
The global Marseille menu
EU and India to double trade turnover
As the European Union and India are each other’s leading trading partners, this topic dominated the agenda of the Ninth Summit, along with other, mostly global, issues.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, which will focus on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power that should be given a greater say in international affairs, but the member states have so far failed to find a common denominator in support of New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This issue was thus not discussed further at yesterday's, already the ninth summit, held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, respectively President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed that trade turnover will double within five years, or rise to more than one hundred billion euros.
With trade in goods rising from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious target.
In a sign of this, twenty-six existing bilateral agreements on civil aviation with India were legally aligned, so that air transport was also given the green light in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised that negotiations would be accelerated.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi ranks ninth among the EU’s partners.
The summit also focused on global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, respectively terrorism, has been condemned by both sides in all its forms and called for the speedy convening of a UN conference.
They also called for the conclusion of the Doha Round of trade negotiations, although both have a large share in its failure to date.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate agenda, namely that it wants to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed, as well as the need to conclude a global agreement at next year’s climate conference and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
Both sides would also like to prevent food price hikes and support the convening of an international conference to analyse the financial crisis.
The Indian prime minister will travel to the French capital today, where he plans to close a deal on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
Paris believes that the mandate for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors worth 20 billion euros will be given to French companies.
According to agency reports, the agreement would be valid for 15 years.
More than three hundred Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Large participation of Italian publishers at the international book fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred and one different countries to take up 171,790 square meters of the fair, with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as the guest of honor.
Deputy Culture Minister Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inaugural ceremony in the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – on 264 square metres of exhibition space.
This will be followed by a press meeting in Room Structures Buchmesse in Hall 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present the numbers, trends and perspectives regarding the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors in relation to the total Italian production is constantly decreasing, mainly due to the literature for children and adults.
The plane of Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of Steve Fossett's plane, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, was found.
The debris was discovered on a plateau at an altitude of three thousand meters, in the Mammoth Lakes area of Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
There were no human remains inside the plane.
The Madeira County Sheriff, John Anderson, dispelled the doubts that still remained: “The plane was found, we sent a team there and now we are sure that this is exactly where Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared,” he said at a press conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been presumed dead since February.
The U.S. Transportation Security Bureau (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the debris was identified, an investigation team was dispatched to finally identify the plane: it was exactly Bellanc 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal items were found by one couple near their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents with Fossett’s name on them, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, for cash and one jacket.
Fossett's search was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire has earned a place in history thanks to a long collection of firsts.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a circumnavigation of the world in an air balloon: a two-week solo flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a plane without landing.
Among his many records are also a flight at an altitude of 15,445 meters, over the Andes, albeit with a co-pilot.
Glk, an advertisement you don't expect
One unusual Suv with an original design and precisely defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last born Glk from the "compact" jeeps of the star's house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring a whirlwind of news to this sector.
It is thanks to its unconventional processing that the unexpected and unconventional communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17.
In this way, the advertising campaign accompanying the debut of the new vehicle will also launch an unofficial way of communication thanks to the futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which is thus used for the first time in Italy for the car brand.
The maxi poster project, broken down into three different phases, will dominate Milan’s main business class, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the introduction of the car in stereoscopic vision and with the help of special glasses, which will be distributed near the Corsa Como, it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, when you look at the picture, you will get the impression that the car will come out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its little things, then reassembled into a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of automotive communication with this advertisement.
Will he be able to arouse the interest of future customers in this way? We will see.
So now we know who the Italian hooligans are
From Trivenet, they're risking Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls for whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been following Nazionale azzurra for years and which, to tell the truth, has never made excessive problems.
He has never met an opponent’s fans.
The orientation of the group is right-wing.
The founders are from Trivenet.
Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, they were joined by groups (in fact, few groups) from Campania and Puglia.
They have three-color flags on which the cities of origin of the participants appear: on Saturday evening they were removed so that they were not recognized.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found true Nazi fans, Levski.
Figc gave Italian fans 144 tickets to the match: all in name, thus easily controllable.
And Viminale really checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the ongoing Dasl, no one who would be forbidden to visit the stadiums.
Four blue fans who had previous offenses from the stadium were denied a ticket and banned from the match.
Now Viminale is waiting for him to read the reports that will come from the Bulgarian police, then he will take action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo for five years at least to fans who have been arrested or those who have been identified during the riots.
International Daspo, which prohibits visits not only to Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer enter any stadium.
Good luck.
But now there is a fear of emulation: that is, more than one hundred and fifty will be added.
“We must immediately put out this fire and not justify those who behave in this way,” Viminal said.
So, "regularly open eyes, mainly because of the national match on Wednesday in Lec".
It is in Puglia that there is a small core of supporters.
The Osservatorio will meet tomorrow, and on Tuesday, the Casms, which can count on one part of Aise, is a secret service that takes care of the problems in the stadiums.
"Congregated Leader-Leader and stretched arm during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria it's not a crime...".
Such is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in a really unhappy way), who is the director of the Viminal Osservatorio for a few weeks (he won the post that used to be Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly a quaestor in Trieste, where the nucleus of Ultras Italia supporters, founded in 2002, is located.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to glorify a leader, but, of course, the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
“I’m not a sociologist,” Osservator Number One adds, “crimes are attributed to the country in which they occurred.
So far, this group has remained within the bounds, now let's take a good look at what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whistle in Mameli’s anthem: it’s not a crime either, but if you’ll excuse me, it’s rudeness.
