A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
“We are a small team that works as a friendly family and will be greatly missed,” the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and condolences go out to Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Luis Galicia said that at first Frank stayed in hostels, but recently "Finally things have been going well for him".
“He found an apartment, he was dating a girl,” Luis Galicia told KGO.
Luis Galicia said he couldn’t imagine anyone wanting to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good heart and a good heart.
His way of communicating with his family has always been to cook us some kind of dish, to cook us dinner,” said Luis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in a fight.
He was a brother who sailed the current.

Scientists have found an animal that can live for 500 years
An international team of biologists has concluded that the longest-lived vertebrate animal is the Greenland polar shark, which can live for about 500 years.
Scientists conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the lens of the eye of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, whose length exceeds five meters, can be from 272 to 512 years.
Biologists believe that an important role in shark longevity is played by low metabolism, which leads to slow development.
The females of Greenland sharks reach sexual maturity only by the age of 150.
Previously, it was believed that the longest living vertebrate animals are the "neighbor" of the shark - the Greenland whale.
The oldest specimen known to scientists was just over 210 years old.

Is it worth going to the sanatorium if there are no health problems?
Our expert is the chief doctor of the sanatorium Olga Bogush.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of work, should he go to a sanatorium?
Sanatorium-resort rest is necessary not only for treatment, but also for the prevention of diseases.
In a sanatorium, a person can check the state of his body and get recommendations from a doctor on how to live so that his health does not deteriorate.
Such recommendations will not be superfluous to anyone.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal of the body, it is not worth waving away.
Constant stress, mental and physical overwork can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
Stress is experienced by about 90% of visitors.
And the most susceptible to it are people from large cities aged 45 to 55 years.
So it is better not to complicate the situation and allow yourself to rest in time.
Studies show that 98% of people reduce their biological age during their stay in a sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer a comfortable rest for the whole family.
So, if you want to spend your holidays with your kids, you don’t have to break up with them.
For children, even the youngest, there are health programs, which include both diagnostic services, pediatrician's consultations, analyzes, and therapeutic.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children's pools), inhalations, a special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, physical therapy.
The course of procedures is determined by the doctor taking into account the individual indications and features of the growing organism.
In addition, in sanatoriums, as a rule, there is a children's club with animators, where children can attend game classes, various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for guests with babies, provide infants with the necessary conditions and provide services of an experienced nanny.
The mild winter, the long summer, the abundance of sunny days in the year (over 300) create good conditions for year-round recreation in the resorts of the Caucasian Mineral Waters.
And then the body needs rest not only in the summer.
So do not be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most procedures are carried out indoors and do not depend on the season.
In general, sanatorium-resort treatment is desirable to be carried out 2 times a year, especially to people of mature age.
The main feature of the region of the Caucasian Mineral Waters, of course, therapeutic mineral springs: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovsky, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect various systems of the body.
Water varies in temperature, amount of salts, general mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor selects water depending on the patient's well-being.
So, "Narzan" has an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory effect, restores the functions of the gastrointestinal tract and metabolism.
"Essentuki-4" affects the gastrointestinal tract, reduces sugar levels.
"Essentuki Nova" has an anti-inflammatory, choleretic and diuretic effect.
The same effects have the water "Slavyanovskaya".
When prescribing water, the doctor must take into account the state of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it picks up less salty water because the salts retain fluid, which leads to an increase in pressure.
The intake of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be drunk at a certain time, in the right amount and at a specific temperature.
Now in the sanatoriums are available and various cosmetic procedures for the face and body.
What types of healing, based on the natural features of the North Caucasus, can be obtained at the resorts of this region?
Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is a salt lake Tambukan, clay mud from which is useful for joints, spine, internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammatory, absorbent, immunomodulatory effect.
These are wellness walks along individually designed routes.
They are especially popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge Resort Park (the second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is in close proximity to the mineral spring "Narzan".
There you can also take wine baths, pearl baths, iodine baths, selenium baths, sage baths, depending on what your doctor prescribes.
Prolong the fruiting.
What to do to make the harvest go to the end of the season?
As told by Yulia Belopukhova, agronomist and summer resident.
Tall tomatoes it's time to arrange a haircut: remove new stepsons, cut the tops, remove all the leaves to the penultimate brush with fruits and inflorescences with small ovaries - do not have time to ripen.
All tomatoes, regardless of the "constitution", as well as peppers and eggplants are fed with ash-superphosphate extract, treated with biopreparations (maturity - to accelerate the pouring and growth of fruits, Fitosporin-M, Fitolavin, Gamair, Bactophyte - for diseases, Immunocytophyte - for enhancing
Of the chemical agents at the end of summer should be used only copper sulfate, colloidal sulfur and green soap.
We make the last watering of plants.
Long-braided cucumbers in the greenhouse are lowered from the wallpaper so that the lower, bare part of the stem (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, we water with warm water and a solution of Zircon, we sprinkle the stem of 5-7 cm of compost.
Prolong the fruiting of the zucchini is also not difficult: cut old leaves, pour warm water and a solution of complex fertilizer, pour fertile soil under the bush.
To protect against night colds, install an arc over the bed with a covering material.
Keep the plants open during the day and close them after sunset.
Signs of the End.
What indicates that Russia is coming out of the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia’s exit from the longest recession in 20 years.
According to analysts interviewed by Bloomberg, the GDP of the Russian Federation shows a positive trend - in the second quarter of GDP decreased by 0.8% in annual terms.
This figure is the lowest since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data of Rosstat, the decline of the Russian economy in the second quarter slowed to 0.6%.
The stabilization of the situation was also recently announced by the Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development.
There is slow growth ahead.
According to experts of the Central Bank, the recession in the Russian economy is in the past.
“The index assessment of the Russian GDP shows that the recession is behind, and ahead is the slow growth of the economy,” the Bank of Russia’s bulletin “What the trends say” says.
The regulator’s modular estimate of GDP for the current quarter has been increased to 0.4%, the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5%.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, during the second quarter, the decline in GDP of the Russian Federation stopped in the second quarter, amounting to 0.2%.
In the second quarter, the seasonally adjusted GDP decline was 0.2% compared to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the decline stopped: in April it amounted to 0.2%, and in May and June the change in GDP was in the range of 0-0.15”, – quotes the representative of the MAYR RIA Novosti.
The slowdown in the fall of the Russian economy over the past five quarters indicates that the “bottom has passed”.
Among other markers pointing to signs of a revival of the national economy, Bloomberg calls the growth of demand for electricity and rail transport, the revival of business.
If we make an adjustment for the fact that the year is leap year, then it is clear that the dynamics in plus 1% of electricity consumption can be half due to the additional working day.
Add to this the lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of freight traffic, but it is difficult to get accurate data, and plus or minus 0.5% of the semi-annual volume can also be explained by seasonality, "explains Kirill Yakovenko from ALOR BROKER.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, reducing price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2% compared to 15.6% in the same month last year.
Moreover, over the past two weeks, Rosstat has been recording deflation.
Prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the ruble exchange rate, which, although it showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, by the end of August from the beginning of the year strengthened by 12%.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, which should be followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy," Yakovenko said.
In addition, since April in Russia there has been an increase in industrial production.
In June, the figure increased by 1.7%.
The rate of decline in foreign trade turnover is slowing down from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May.
The positive dynamics is also demonstrated by the situation in the labor market, where the unemployment rate has decreased to 5.4%.
It was lower only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the prosperous situation in the labor market, the question of the real disposable incomes of the population is left to be desired.
In annual terms, the figure is reduced by 4.8 percent.
This factor can slow down the economic recovery, as household spending makes a significant contribution to GDP.
As a rule, in the structure of the economy, their share exceeds 50%.
In addition to low consumer activity, the Bank of Russia’s tough policy can also be called as risk factors for economic growth.
The regulator keeps the rate at 10.5%, which does not affect the real sector in the best way.
A negative factor is the insufficient level of investment, which hinders the development of industrial potential.
But in general, we can assume that by the end of the year the rate of decline of the Russian economy will slow down to -0.5% against -3.7% in 2015," said Irina Rogova, an analyst at Forex Club Group.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and perfectly established in winter sports at the Olympics in Sochi, is not yet so actively developed in summer sports.
If in the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia and ex-foreigners speak, then in most cases we are talking about the natives of the countries - the former republics of the Soviet Union.
But in Rio de Janeiro, we can observe the reverse process - a fairly large number of Russians act under the flags of other states.
In each case, the history of the change of citizenship is different.
Some parents were taken to another country in childhood, leaving no choice.
Someone could not stand the competition for a place in the Russian national team.
And someone believed that the best conditions for development in sports would be created abroad.
AIF.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
The German passport of a 27-year-old girl says her name is Lisa Red.
But before that, she was Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in the city of Omsk.
Just four years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lisa’s parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow in the footsteps of her older sister - to do athletics.
Just like her sister, Lisa chose to jump with a pole.
If she stayed in Russia, she would hardly be able to “move from the throne” Elena Isinbaeva.
Unfortunately, at the Olympics in Rio Lisa will be the only countrywoman, albeit a former, in the sector for jumping with a pole.
Her best achievements in this sport are the bronze of the 2010 European Championship and the silver of the continental championship in 2016, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbayeva.
29-year-old Elena Pirozhkova was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are evangelical religious propagandists.
In large part because of their faith, they left for the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, there were eight other children in the family.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena became interested in wrestling in school.
Showing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where she continued classes at the U.S. Combat Training Center under the leadership of another former Russian Vladislav Izboinikov.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost in her first fight.
But at the World Cup in the same year - a victory.
Before that, she, by the way, managed to win silver at the 2010 world championships.
This was followed by bronze in 2013 and silver in 2014.
26-year-old Maria was born in the city of Yaroslavl, where she first got acquainted with synchronized swimming.
But to say that she was raised by our coaches in Russia would be wrong.
Soon the girl’s family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in the city of Colorado.
Mary continued her studies there.
Soon she was in the U.S. national team and showed great results at the Pan-American Games.
It is clear that at a serious international level, it cannot compete with Russian synchronists, but for America its indicators are the ceiling.
The new name, which sounds strange in Russian, Christina Chaldybina received at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue training the girl in rhythmic gymnastics overseas.
Until that moment, the girl was engaged in a favorite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
Having emigrated to the United States, she quickly entered the youth team of this country, and later broke into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
For the first positions on the world stage, of course, she did not have to fight, but for the United States, she organized a real breakthrough - brought the star-striped team to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another of our former "artists" is Jana Berezko-Marggrander, who plays for the German national team.
She was born in Togliatti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany - there the girl had more chances to get into the national team.
Soon she represented her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
There, however, Yana was able to take only 17th place, not enough to get into the final competition in the personal championship.
But two years before that, she managed to win a bronze medal at the Olympic Games - junior.
Another gymnast, only this time sports - Irina Sazonova.
If the ways of emigration of the previously mentioned athletes can be called standard, then the choice of the Irina family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a student of Volgograd sports school.
Naturally, in Iceland, she immediately became the champion of the country.
True, Ira trains still in Russia - specially comes to his homeland in order not to lose his skills.
In Rio, she did not perform as well as she would like.
The best place is 40 in a personal all-around.
There is very little information about the swimmer Maria Ugolkova in the Russian information space.
For a very long time Maria lives and trains in Switzerland.
However, for a long time she performed under the Russian flag, showing good results - there was even a record of the country at the distance of 200 meters butterfly.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and began to perform under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance was 14th place in the 4<0xC3><0x97>100 relay.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project, thanks to which she was able to collect about 6 thousand francs, which allowed her to pay for the preparation for the Olympics.
31-year-old freestyle fighter Adam Batirov spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During this time, a native of Hasavyurt managed to become a three-time winner of the European Championships, a champion of Russia, a master of sports of Russia of international class.
When he stopped getting into our national team, it was time to think about changing citizenship.
For several years, the talented wrestler disappeared from the sports platforms.
The triumphant return took place at the 2016 Asian Championships - Batirov already represented Bahrain, for which he won a gold medal and received a ticket to the Olympics in Rio.
About another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, at home even less is known than even about the Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkova.
The fact is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
It was there that Michael began to practice gymnastics.
It has not achieved much success at the international level.
In Rio, his best result was 40th place in the qualification on parallel bars.
But for New Zealand, even getting to the Olympic Games in gymnastics is a breakthrough.
When Nastya, who was born in Moscow in 1985, was only 9 years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her synchronized swimming classes, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, the girl took 6th place in synchronized swimming.
In a duet with Evgenia Tetelbaum, Anastasia took eighth place.
In the solo program, she was fifth.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Kreuter plays for the Israel national team.
When the boy was only 6 years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry already became the champion of the country.
In the same year, he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Kreuter also won gold at the Singapore Youth Olympic Games.
In addition to high jumps, Dmitry is engaged in long jumps and triple jumps.
31-year-old Albert is another native of Hasavyurt, who after long performances for Russia decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which he would represent in Rio.
In Russia, he played for the School of the highest sports skills of Krasnoyarsk, in 2011 even became the champion of the country.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the player of the USSR national volleyball team Yaroslav Antonov.
Just a year before the birth of his son, Yaroslav was recognized as the best volleyball player on the planet.
He soon decided to pursue a career in Italy.
The family stayed there for permanent residence.
In 2015, as part of the national team, he became the bronze medalist of the European Championship held on the territory of his new homeland.
Khadzhiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and was with his family in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, his parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but it was not possible to get to this northern country - I had to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimkhan continued to study freestyle wrestling.
He soon won the World Junior Championships and later qualified for the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the wrestling tournament.
Again a free fight, and again a former Russian.
This time we will talk about a native of North Ossetia, who emigrated to Spain - about Taimuraz Frieva.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship and currently plays for the national team of that country.
Before that, however, the 30-year-old athlete managed to score high results in Russia.
He became the bronze medalist of the national championships in 2007 and 2008.
Tired of not getting into the national team, Taimuraz decided to change sports citizenship.
The last on our list is the Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan Makhachkala, Artur Biyarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
It was there that Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, began boxing.
Since then, Arthur has been the champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 he became the world champion among young people.
In 2015, Biyarslanov won the gold of the Pan American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Married, has a son.
Why do children attend Cossack classes in schools?
According to Governor V. Kondratyev, "Cossacks should be brought up not by actions and parades, but systematically."
They should grow up and at least from the age of 7 understand that they are Cossacks and education should be Cossack.
But so far, I think, this work is being done formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Cossack classes absorb all the positive that has been accumulated earlier, at a qualitatively new level, I will be happy.
If everything is rushed and it is not known how, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
Housing and communal services continue to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country’s economy.
There is an encroachment on the funds allocated for the needs of the utilities sector from the budgets of different levels.
According to the Prosecutor General’s Office, inflated tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the field of housing and communal services.
As a result, consumers of the region overpaid energy companies more than 170 million rubles.
Recently, the prosecutor’s office of the Krasnodar Territory revealed the facts of including unreasonable costs in the tariffs.
And in the expenses of LLC "IV-consulting" (it puts cold water) were laid 4 million rubles. on car rental at a price above the market.
There are many examples of this in the country.
The people give the last money for the "municipal" and pay correctly - according to the Ministry of Construction of the Russian Federation, the average collection of payments from the population is 94%.
He is charged with several articles of the Criminal Code: embezzlement, legalization of proceeds from crime, abuse of power, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund, which was engaged in the repair of urban facilities, Makarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, work on them was not actually carried out, but paid.
Businessmen simply returned most of the money to him.
And as the owner of the UK, Makarov collected money from the population, but did not pay service providers and spent them on their needs.
As a result, the damage to the budget and residents - millions of rubles.
Makarov’s scheme of machinations, alas, is typical for Russia.
A whole wave of arrests and detentions of the leaders of the Criminal Code swept through the country, which appropriated the money of citizens.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kochan continues, by the way, also a former deputy of the city council, who is accused of machinations for 91.7 million rubles.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013 in Elizovo Kamchatka region, he established 6 management companies and created 3 limited liability companies.
One of them performed contract work for the Criminal Code, the other two played the role of settlement and cash centers, that is, took money from the population.
However, A. Kohan did not transfer funds to the power engineers, but spent it on himself, his beloved.
Judging in the field of housing is quite difficult.
Things don't get excited, they get delayed.
And "helps" in this extremely confusing housing legislation, - says Svetlana Razvorotneva, Executive Director of NP "JKH Control".
We do not have time to earn one law, as we invent a new one, which should make the previous one work.
Specialists, including judges, on housing and communal services are also few.
Lawyers themselves admit that housing law in universities is given very little attention.
About the refusal to initiate criminal cases, about the delay in the course of investigations, they also speak in the Prosecutor General's Office.
Of the 3,5 thousand crimes in the proceedings in 2015, less than half were sent to court.
For the rest, the investigation was protracted, and one in five was suspended due to the failure to identify the accused person.
Often, shortcomings in the activities of law enforcement agencies are attributed to gaps in the current legislation.
There is a law, but the authorities are in no hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of counterfeiting – only 60 criminal cases were initiated.
In the first five months of this year, the number increased only slightly - 99.
And what is the falsification of the protocol of the meeting of tenants?
This means that the change of management of the house, financial and other issues bypass the opinion of the owners.
And this also means that normal companies that want to work honestly, and not "milk" the population, cannot break into the market of housing and communal services.
It turns out, tenants in the minus, small and medium-sized businesses too.
First of all, by eliminating corruption as such in the whole state, - said Anton Zharkov, a member of the State Duma Committee on property.
And now this work is actively being carried out.
This is not just a single action - it is a targeted course to fight corruption.
Of course, not in all regions such a sad situation.
In particular, in the capital scandals and does not smell.
Why is there no such scandals in the housing and communal services sector in Moscow as in many other regions?
Yes, because the capital's government has shown iron will and brought order, - told "AIF" Anatoly Electoral, a member of the State Duma Committee on security and anti-corruption.
I am referring to the personnel issue, legislative amendments, and legal education.
Management companies are closely monitored, and all of them have gone through licensing.
Complaints of citizens are promptly resolved in public space (and residents’ appeals, and response measures are posted on the portal of the Moscow government).
Many do not just pay monthly receipts, but carefully monitor what is written there, how the house is contained.
Awareness among the population of the rights of owners and obligations of resource supply and management organizations is very high.
Plus, Moscow checks the validity of tariffs for housing and communal services - after all, a considerable part of the budget funds goes to subsidies and benefits for numerous categories of the population.
Perhaps all this together explains the calm situation in Moscow.
Is it at the discretion of the regional authorities?
Is it worth it to change jobs?
The Turkish Gambit.
Will Erdogan be able to refuse friendship with the EU and the United States?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has issued a U.S. ultimatum proposing a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic preacher accused of orchestrating a coup.
He said this in front of his supporters in Ankara.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an called on the Americans to abandon their support for the “terrorist organization of the Fethullahs.”
This is not the first statement from Turkey, in which the United States calls for a change in its position.
Experts believe that the split in relations between Turkey and the West is growing and may lead to a new attempt to change the government in the country.
“Sooner or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO.
Either a coup d'état by FETO or a democratic Turkey.
She has to make that choice,” Erdogan said in an address in Ankara on Wednesday evening.
The President of Turkey once again, but more strongly demanded from the United States to fulfill his demand, voiced by him for the first time immediately after the suppression of the rebellion.
Recall that on the night of July 16, in Turkey, high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army attempted to overthrow the legitimate government in the country, as well as an attempt was made on the life of the head of state.
However, after Recep Tayyip Erdogan addressed the population, the rebellion was suppressed and its organizers and participants arrested.
In total, about 8 thousand people fell under suspicion, in the ranks of which, in addition to the military, there were teachers and scientists.
According to Recep Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah G<0xC3><0xBC>len, who lives in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States.
Erdogan’s supporters also admitted that Americans could be directly involved in the coup.
The United States denied all claims, refusing to extradite Gulen and advising to change the tone.
The latest statement of the representatives of the State Department in this regard was made at the time of Erdogan’s visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey - he insists on his own and also puts demands on his other Western partners.
“Ankara will cease to fulfill its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not name the date of the abolition of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens,” Turkish Minister for EU Affairs Omer Celik said on August 9.
According to him, Ankara’s amendments to the anti-terrorist law, as required by the EU, will endanger Europe’s own security.
On August 1, German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the European Union with promises to open borders for migrants in order to achieve visa facilitation with the EU.
His words were a response to the relevant statement of the Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.
Cavusoglu made another provocative statement last Wednesday, admitting that Turkey could withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry did not rule out that the country will consider withdrawing from the alliance if it does not meet the expected support from it.
The decision to increase defense cooperation with Russia is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign states in the defense sphere - they import missiles," Cavusoglu said in an interview with Anadolu Agency.
According to him, Turkey now needs to create its own defense system based on its technologies, as well as cooperate with other countries.
“Until now, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results did not satisfy us, and we began to look for others,” the minister said.
Experts believe that all this speaks of Turkey’s serious disagreements with the West and the country’s reorientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise, Yevgeny Minchenko, believes that Recep Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot go to a tough confrontation with the West.
He has a lot tied to the West both in terms of business and in terms of military (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think Erdogan will try to balance while maintaining a framework relationship with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for Americans to see a completely obedient person in this post," the expert explained to AIF.ru.
According to him, it is possible that after the statements of the Turkish leader (on non-payment of EU compensation, on the requirement of visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of G<0xC3><0xBC>len from the United States) he will be pressured.
"Erdogan will face a deterioration in relations with both America and the European Union, and they will put pressure on him precisely on humanitarian issues, for dictatorial methods of governing the country and so on," Minchenko said.
The head of the Center for Political Information, Alexei Mukhin, admits that the President of Turkey will change his point of view in relations with Russia as soon as it becomes profitable for him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took an extremely hard line on Russia and sought favor in the West by all means.
In a very short time, the situation has changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that after some time the Turkish president will not change his priorities again.
I think Erdogan has entered a period of shuttle diplomacy.
Being between the two poles - the West and Russia, he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself," Mukhin said.
In his opinion, the main task for the President of Turkey today is to maintain political power in the country, and for this he needs Russia and partnership with Vladimir Putin, so that the United States stops supporting Gulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US, which use it to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, a consensus with Turkey will be reached," the expert said.
The head of the Center for Asia and the Middle East, Anna Glazova, takes a different view.
Turkey’s relations with both the EU and the United States are quite tense now, and this is primarily due to the domestic policy pursued personally by Erdogan.
I think that this crisis in relations will be aggravated, and against the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reset the policy both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no coincidence that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, declare that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, relations with Israel have been settled, active political interaction with Iran is underway," Glazova said, adding that Erdogan's next step would be to normalize relations with Egypt.
According to her, the policy that Erdogan is now pursuing is a return to the course of the foreign policy concept that Turkey followed before the beginning of the Arab revolutions.
It was then that Turkey began to develop its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region very actively in the positions of “zero problems with neighbors”.
We have had very successful visits by the Turkish President to Russia and African countries.
Therefore, this vector of foreign policy will develop and contribute to the strengthening of Turkey's position both on the regional and international arena," the expert said.
Glazova believes that it will be incredibly difficult for Turkey to return to its former relations with the EU, now the question is rather whether the EU will begin to respond harshly to Turkey, which can go to open borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
The strike of junior doctors: calls for new collective protests
Representatives of the junior doctors appealed to the union with a request to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over a new employment contract.
The British Medical Association’s (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) is going to ask for its full advice to support more collective protests from early September.
JDC says the ministers failed to answer questions about the employment contract.
Junior doctors and medical students in July voted to cancel the deal under an employment contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who participated in the secret ballot.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said the government had continued to be “persistently silent” about the issues that she said led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said: “Given the current situation, the JDC leader voted to reject the proposed new employment contract in full and called for formal renegotiations on all your issues.”
In response to the government’s silence, the head of the JDC today made an official request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program to expand collective protests, beginning in early September.
The dispute has led to young doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first general strike in the history of the Public Health Service.
The leader of the BMA’s junior doctors, Dr. Joan Malavana, resigned after voting to cancel the agreed terms of the employment contract recommended by the BMA.
He told members of the BMA that the deal was a good one to take, during meetings ahead of the vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the employment contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Alliance of the bad"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare the official end of an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had a firm impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin’s smile seemed strained, and he hardly radiated heat even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, by contrast, has repeatedly spoken of his “dear friend” Mr. Putin — five times, according to one report.
I lost the account.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan’s actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm suggested the opposite.
But the lingering coolness emanating from Mr. Putin has shown that the Russian leader has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at this point was frenzied.
Mr. Putin burst into an angry tirade, accusing Ankara of punching Moscow in the back.
The insult was even stronger, coming from an alleged friend.
Restoring real trust will be difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media have been waging a stunning, all-out assault on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks should be considered guilty of everything.
The most serious were accusations from senior officials that Mr. Erdogan’s own family profited from the illegal trade in oil from the areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it emphatically.
But in St. Petersburg, there was an official signal that it was time to move on.
In the end, this meeting happened only because Mr. Putin received an apology that he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get, after he was almost deposed last month in a coup attempt.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit hard — especially the ban on charter flights, which typically bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number fell sharply by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies will certainly feel relieved when the flights finally resume.
They are at the peak of the end of the season in the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products are allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," according to a report in the Vedomosti newspaper.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it sees as a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to this her prolonged discontent with the turtle-like pace of talks about joining the EU and Mr. Putin’s move – which seeks to take advantage of the coolness and gradually destroy Turkey’s ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for the support of elected authorities after the coup attempt.
Keep in mind this is a given for Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.
So, the summit in this brilliant palace on the seashore allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described to me as an “alliance of the bad”: two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West, joining forces.
Yet, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey back opposing sides.
Perhaps it speaks for itself that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, while the two presidents were giving a press conference, they did not even touch on this topic.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering questions about their differences, while Mr. Putin chose to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find a common language on Syria.
But after months of open hostility — and considering the possibility of a total catastrophe when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian jet fighter — it’s better that the two leaders at least talk again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand should be reduced to the role of a back office, according to the bank’s executive director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has retreated from them since it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued.
During this period, brand strategists used “RBS” to protect other consumer lending brands.
It was backed by millions of pounds of sponsorship for international sports, from the Six Nations Rugby Cup to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been decided that it is right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will gain more influence – Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt’s Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan gave an interview during a tour of clients and staff in Invernessshire.
He told the BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and the one our staff will be employed in, because we are now becoming more of a bank of brands.”
Since the bank itself has become a global brand, RBS has become a global brand.
I am saying now that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their population groups, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship support of the Six Nations Cup, and it is building up the profile of various brands in sponsoring the sport.
“This is the right time for us to move the bank of brands, as basically (we asked ourselves) how do we focus on improving the bank for customers?” said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and shut down all those brands.
But with the work we’ve been doing focusing on customer needs rather than our own, I think you’re seeing a lot of change.
We can bring those brands back again, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori Reaches 3,000 Winners With Newmarket's Victory on Passion
Dettori splashes champagne after a double at Newmarket leads him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori scored his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this preeminent mark with the help of his second night winner on his home track – The Passion, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this outstanding mark in smooth racing.
It follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lestor Piggott, Pat Iddery, and Willie Carson.
Three-time Jockey Champion Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, said: “It’s something special.”
I am very excited because my family is here too.
I am very glad that it happened in Newmarket, since it is here that I settled 30 years ago.
It’s not a big social event, it’s not a Royal Ascot – it’s a normal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm free and very unpretentious.
Dettori applauds when he brings Predisposition after victory
Two jockeys have reached such a mark in obstacle racing: Jockey champion Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era, and it’s no surprise that he has reached that mark so few have reached before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical ingenuity that distinguishes him from others in the weight room.
He is a great representative for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom, he would have brought 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend jockey and a big racer!
And seriously, Frankie has been bringing winners to the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He’s an energetic character, which is good for British racing, but more than that, he’s an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this outstanding mark with the company's fast jump from the horse
From fast-paced finishes to fast-paced jumps, Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of British smooth racing for two decades.
It was ups and downs.
A host of big-race winners, including his famous "Magnificent Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was disqualified for doping.
Three years ago, he first encountered difficulties when he returned after a six-month disqualification, but he showed tremendous willpower to challenge the skeptics and get back in shape.
And he may not have finished for a while yet — Dettori had previously said he would like to continue competing until at least the age of 50.
Putin dismisses the head of the administration of Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted inner circle for years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as a representative for environment and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said Putin had “decided to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration,” but did not name the reason.
Mr. Ivanov’s deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, was appointed his successor.
Mr. Vaino, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he was the head of the presidential protocol department and the government apparatus, according to the Kremlin website (in Russian).
During his appointment, he said to Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are being carried out.
Putin told a Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to be relieved of his post and recommended that Vaino replace him.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a move that has puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest supporters and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on state television, both men said that the head of the administration resigned of his own accord.
But despite the smiles on the camera, this has convinced few here – especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So, are these the unintended consequences of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement — that the man once agitated as a potential president suddenly wanted to run Russia’s environmental policy — was met with huge skepticism.
In remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said: “It is true that in early 2012 I asked you in an interview to entrust me with this very difficult position, even, one might say, a problematic position, for four years.
Well, it turns out that I was the head of the presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB State Security Service, as is Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become Russia’s president after Putin’s second term, as a third term for Putin would run counter to the constitution.
However, this position was taken by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency just three and a half years later.
'Think Like a Criminal' TV Star Thomas Gibson Fired After Fight With Producer
Gibson was involved in a brawl on the set of a show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his removal was announced.
There were creative differences on the set and differences of opinion.
I am sorry that this happened,” he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson’s character will be deleted from the show, which tracks the FBI’s team of agents, are expected to come later, according to statements from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has been on the show since the first season in 2005.
“I love Thinking Like a Criminal and have put my heart and soul into it for the past twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.
I had hoped to be in it to the end, but now it would be impossible.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our wonderful team, and most importantly, the best fans the show could have ever dreamed of.
The show is scheduled to return for its twelfth season on September 28.
Mystery: Fish landed in the garden of Banff
A man from Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could have been sandstones left behind by a water spruce.
Bane, who lives 500 meters from the sea, posted a picture of this spectacle in Periscope in the hope that someone could shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern span and the Queensferry Crossing viaduct – meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four closures between the canvas fans, which are now coming to completion near all three pylons of the bridge.
The section of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 bridges.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnessing an engineering art of truly epic scale in this project where over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel have been used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the junction between the viaduct and the bridge leaf is a virtuoso operation using extremely accurate tolerances for assembly.
In total, about 79% of the entire bridge canvas is now in place, for the last section of the canvas, the concrete coating is cast in Rosate today, which means that the entire canvas is ready to rise to the spot on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project director, said: “The first closure on every bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this stunning project, this closure represents the most modern construction art.
After installing the last section of the roadway and connecting it with the expanding roadway of the North Pole, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or facing the shore - side.
This was done by pulling the viaduct of the northern approach 700 millimeters to the south.
It was a large-scale and at the same time very elegant operation.
Large-scale, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be raised to an inclination angle of about 3%.
Graceful because the tolerances the team worked on were tiny — just a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, it all went very well.
Moelfr Bay rescue: Three men 'lucky to be alive'
The three men were "lucky to stay alive" after being thrown off a fishing boat in Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised the alarm at 13:20 UK daylight saving time on Friday, after the team saw the incident unfolding in Moelfre Bay.
The three men struggled to reach a safe place while their ship continued on its course.
“We saw their ship circling next to them and assumed the worst,” Moelfre’s pilot Vince Jones said.
“Fortunately, by the time we got down on the water, a strong wind carried him away from them,” he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and a third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and trapped in a buoy without a life jacket.
All of them were picked up on board the coastal lifeboat and taken to the rescue station.
Jones said: “The three men thrown into the water were lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had an emergency breaker, but it somehow detached itself from the person driving the boat when it capsized.
Someone was guarding these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a worthy hunt for health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
That teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, has been a complaint of many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go takes people off the couch and engages in some physical activity.
Screen time was initially limited to television, then video games, and more recently smartphones.
It’s so great to see that technology and street activity aren’t mutually exclusive.
I am, of course, referring to the Pokémon Go craze, an app based on characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (which subsequently spawned a series of cartoons, playing cards, and other offshoots).
Like many other pop cultural phenomena, all this lost its former relevance a little before this new game became available in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries at the time was delayed due to a massive response that overloaded the servers.
In a matter of days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, players with smartphones go looking for Pokémon that are tracked by GPS and, once detected, can be ‘photographed’ (via a screenshot on your phone) or ‘caught’.
The generation that played the game when they were younger joined the frantic fascination by tearing themselves away from the couches to look for.
In the US, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the “ordinary” person daily.
Cardiogram, an app for the Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s launch, the number of people it tracked who performed 30-minute exercises daily jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary data on the level passing.
Many health campaigns urging people to “find 30 minutes”, “get off the couch” and “be active every day” have not found a response because most health messages are boring and spoken by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high blood pressure, diabetes and yet a long list of benefits, too long to list here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it pulls people out into the street to do what they love.
Thus, the three pillars of health are covered: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As usual, there are boring bores who are looking for something to complain about.
And, yes, someone might come knocking on the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Despite the fact that smartphone apps like Fitbit could track our physical activity in the past, they didn’t give us as much reason to exercise as this game does.
The novelty will take root, and the use will weaken over time.
However, due to the success of Pokemon, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simone Biles wins the gold of the absolute championship in women's gymnastics
Forget about the pressure.
Forget the fuss.
Simone Biles is invulnerable to all of this.
Dynamic on the base jump.
Unforced on a log.
Stunning on the floor.
It's amazing everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of absolute champion on Thursday, placing the chasm between herself and the rest of the world at a convincing demonstration under Olympic scrutiny.
Her total score of 62,198 was at a good distance from the silver medalist and teammate of the “Final Five” Eli Reisman and the Russian bronze medalist Alia Mustafina.
Bilez from the United States performs on a gymnastic log during the Women's Individual Absolute Rhythmic Gymnastics Championship final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth consecutive American woman to win the absolute championship title and the fifth overall, cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She burst into tears when she was shown her final overall score and her long journey to that point was over.
This achievement puts her in the same league as extremely rare track and field athletes like Michael Phelps, who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has spent the past three years dominating her sport, winning 15 World Championships medals – including 10 golds – with such stunning programs in their mix of hard work and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her “the greatest gymnast I’ve ever seen.”
One last test awaited in Brazil, the competition is not so much between Bales and others in this field, but between her and the load of inflated expectations.
Anything less than going back to your family’s home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be seen as an unwarranted wait.
Simona Biles from the United States, left, and Eli Reisman hug after winning gold and silver respectively in the Women's Individual Absolute Rhythmic Gymnastics Championship final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Biles earned her first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for the outgoing national team coordinator Marta Karoli’s farewell party.
While Biles insisted that she never looked into the future during her long journey to the top, that’s not entirely true.
Part of her free exercise program—the one that includes her signature walkthrough—is set to Latin American music that would fit right in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandfather and grandmother as a toddler and discovered by coach Amy Burman's mother during a visit to the gym where Burman was the coach, became a force.
She hasn’t lost a single absolute championship since the summer of 2013, a streak that should last as long as Bales wants.
Despite the fact that Mustafina gained a small advantage with the help of two rotations, it was a mirage.
The gymnastic log and freestyle exercises – where Bales defends the title of world champion – lie in wait.
She again came out ahead with 15,433 on the log and finished with 15,933 on the floor.
Reisman hugged her gently as they waited for the final count—a sheer formality—and tears appeared around the brilliant red with white and blue eyeliner Biles when the design she had once recorded in the clipping album came to fruition.
Reisman's performance was a small revenge for what happened four years ago, when she shared third place, but lost to bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreak.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team that Americans call “grandmother” was far ahead.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her free exercise covered by a return that sometimes seemed questionable.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old’s viral tweet from earlier this week now has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in the case of a serial killer shot while listening to music in the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack on the first Phoenix serial killer in a decade were sitting in a car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter, Malia, were shot dead on June 12 when their car was parked on the roadway, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired about eight shots from a gun while standing on the passenger side of the vehicle and then fled in another vehicle, the report said.
Police say the triple murder did not appear to be the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the wallet or $2,900 in possession of one of the adult victims.
A Phoenix police spokesman, Sgt. Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to check whether it was related to the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas within four months.
“It’s happening in a residential area in front of the house,” Howard KPHO, a CBS affiliate, told CBS earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan in the late 1990s, a black BMW in the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
The 31-year-old Liner and his daughter, Malia, were killed on the spot.
A witness told police there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found the casings and extracted the bullet from the seat and fragments of the bullet from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old child with microcephaly: “Becoming better”
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixivto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund’s microcephaly is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Pixivto, was unaware of during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was I couldn’t do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't sign up for this.
What’s really not true is of course you’re signing up for it,” she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even offered to put him in a specialized medical institution.
“My first response was, ‘I didn’t think people would do that anymore,’” Pixivto explained.
Edmund walks with the help of walkers.
Edmund did not sit or crawl until he was three, and he still does not speak.
But he is slowly going through some stages.
He walks with outside help and rides a bicycle.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows a gesture that Edmund invented for "please sing to me."
“We’re teaching him sign language,” Pixivto told CBS News.
But not just ordinary sign language — she says Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly can occur due to a number of different circumstances: genetic, such as Edmund, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It is too early to say how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Pixivto recalls emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
Did I always tell you what was going to happen?
What's gonna happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn’t actually ask for a lifetime forecast because I don’t expect anyone to really be able to tell me.
But Pixivto has encouraging advice for mothers of children with birth defects because of Zika.
It's getting better.
You know that everything will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding cause rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more rainfall expected to fall over the state before Saturday inclusive.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi have washed ashore and are threatening widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service said.
Louisiana Governor John Bell Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and assistance has already gone to affected parishes.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the Office of the Governor for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said there were requests for transportation for high water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that only the arrival of Tanjipaho requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood risk remains in place until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches could flood the area.
In southern Alabama, flood watch was in effect until Friday as rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
The Komit River near Baton Rouge and the Amit River near Dan Springs, both in Louisiana, were forecast to set a record for the level of flooding over the weekend.
Forecaster Alec Krautmann said both rivers could have flooded many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flood going downstream in the Assenshen parish is a threat as these bloated rivers will slowly drain into Lake Morpa.
The Tikfo River, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue workers were still pulling people out of the flooding in Amit and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued early Friday near Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, says Beaver Creek waters, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, quickly rose overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives nearby had warned him.
“We woke up and the water kept coming,” Hansford said.
It has reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford it was the largest influx she had seen in 48 years living here.
Hansford said he and all members of his family are disabled and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued all three with the help of an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they were sheltering on Friday.
Krautmann says the flood is "spreading rapidly" as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight until Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil was oversaturated with rainfall from Wednesday.
Heavy rain and flooding in the streets have led to the rescue of residents from their homes in Tanjipahoa parish and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, authorities say.
WWL, a CBS affiliate, reports that a Tanjipahoa adviser told about 200 flooded homes.
Residents have been evacuated to two churches, but both are now being flooded.
The parish’s chairman, Robbie Miller, said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets stranded in the high water.
Shelters were opened in the town of Amit and the town of Hammond to receive those who were evacuated.
“They will have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water starts to recede,” he said.
In the town of Hammond, Tanjipahoa parish about two dozen streets were closed due to high water levels, and sandbags were made available to residents in the hope that they would keep water away from homes and businesses.
“The last major flood we had was in March,” said city manager Lacey Landrum.
It is on its way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, the head of the Emergency Services, Rupert Lacey, said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to him, several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, the head of the Shopper Value Foods store in Amit, has lived in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places I’ve never seen it before,” Towson said, “and it’s still pouring down on the ground.”
Mahaj Brown, 6, "spoiled by bullets", remains alive after a shootout in Philadelphia
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, registering a second shooting at a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
Grandmother and grandfather say Brown suffered numerous gunshot wounds, including his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious when he was taken to hospital.
“He got a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets,” says his grandmother Delores Melendez of the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is listed in the hospital in critical condition and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station he was expected to recover.
He had to go to the first grade in the local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is reported to be in critical condition; two other victims have been reported in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot dead in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether one of the injured men could have been the shooter.
Investigators are reporting to CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been a shootout between several armed men.
Semi-automatic weapon cartridges attributed to various instances of semi-automatic weapons covered the scene.
It certainly seemed like a long battle.
There were casings on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
Therefore, it seems that there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shootout,” said Philadelphia police captain Anthony Ginaldi.
Many homes and cars in the area were also affected.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly looking at video surveillance cameras.
Another 6-year-old child, a girl, was struck in the arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane area.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is what I call this year’s women’s Olympic gymnastics team and for several reasons.
First, I’ve been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And two: in this team, the key role is played by three gymnasts: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Lory" Hernandez, who have already inspired so many non-white girls.
The composition of this team, supplemented by Eli Reisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Cauchan, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally looks like America.
It also strengthened the black and Latino female presence at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American woman.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were No. 1 and No. 2.
It's powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed it.
Now the world could witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez performing unexpected, but nevertheless virtuoso gymnastics exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman in a row to win gold in the women’s individual absolute championship.
And teammate Eli Reisman earned silver.
We are witnessing the peak of this sport, but it does not look like that in gymnastic sections all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all chose the same path as Ali and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the “final five” because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts on the team, and this is the final year of Marta Karoli’s coaching.
But in reality, gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts first train in private gymnastic clubs supported by parents paying tuition, equipment, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts and families), and the list goes on.
Most of these gymnastic clubs are located in wealthy suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get everything from their workouts, and this is an expensive and long-term responsibility for gymnast families.
Amy Burman, coach Simona Biles, and Maggie Honey, coach Lori Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We must create a more affordable and accessible gymnastics education for the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simona, Gabby and Lori.
I started my own gymnastic foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and low-cost gymnastics classes located in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (mostly black and Latino) and educated national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality youth gymnastics that deserves the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resistance to grueling work, discipline and perseverance for the mind.
This combination has a lifelong positive impact on good health, success in school and work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to do gymnastics, and this is wonderful.
Playing sports is so important, especially for girls.
It's such a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simone, Elie, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for this serious demonstration of “Women’s Power” in winning team Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls of all backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors took to the announcement of further strikes after the rejection of the proposal by Jeremy Hunt
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing an amended treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt unveiled plans to introduce the treaty, saying the NHS was on “no man’s land” and any subsequent delay would harm staff and patients.
The first junior doctors have been transferred to a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve after-hours care.
Dr. Ellen McCott, chairman of the BMA’s Young Doctors Committee, said in a statement last night: “Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly.”
There are only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors will be transferred to a new contract, progress is needed, and time is running out.
The WMA’s attempt to resolve the dispute through negotiations was met with reluctance to take action and sometimes complete silence from the government.
And that's despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now to encourage the introduction and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If he does not, then the junior doctors are unequivocal that they are ready to organize subsequent strikes.
The latest strike at the end of April brought a delay of about 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nurses' appointments, while nurses and consultants were brought in to ensure the replacement of doctors on the picket line.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing an amended treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
The WMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who will fall under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, urged junior doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer said: “Strikes achieve little or nothing, but put pressure on already-on-limit teams and services, and cause anxiety, physical pain and distress to patients, caregivers and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Physicians and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of caregivers and corporate information policies.
Workers hoped that continued positive contributions on other important topics — such as staff allocation, learning flexibility, additional training for those returning after a career break, tuition costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave, and gender pay differentials in medicine — were a sign of how seriously employers, Health Education England, and the Department of Health had met in February.
The drug for 2 pounds a day can reduce the threat of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are going to use the drug for 2 pounds a day, after authorities recommended giving it to more people and for a longer time.
The anti-clotting drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already prescribed for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or a new attack.
The National Health Service (NICE) has recommended giving it to people for four years to further eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the UK’s National Health Service has now advised NICE to give it to people for four years to further eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack happens to about 140,000 people in England every year, and a quarter of them have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fatty material on the walls of the arteries and the formation of plaques.
If the plaque breaks into parts, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the clot moves, it will be able to move through the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the name Brilique, reduces the risk, making blood clots less likely.
A draft NICE guideline published today recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite having effective secondary prevention methods, about a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack experience another heart attack or stroke – often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
There is evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By recommending ticagrelor in advance, we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor — especially the risk of bleeding — is limited over the course of three years, the draft guideline does not recommend treatment beyond that time.
PC ownership culture allows vote-counting falsification to flourish in Muslim areas
Former Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption, prompting a government report.
A culture of political correctness has led to an eye-closure that has resulted in widespread vote-counting falsification in Muslim communities, according to a devastating government report released today.
Former Cabinet Secretary Sir Eric Pickles has been criticised by police, election observers and city officials for ignoring evidence of electoral irregularities because of "excessive sensitivity about race and religion".
The former secretary of local communities, now an anti-corruption tsar, said the religious intimidation of voters was so strong that police should be allowed to set up borders outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He suggests that voters take ID cards to prove who they are when they vote.
At the moment, voters only need to indicate their name and address.
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on people’s fingers when they hand in their ballots, with the aim of eliminating so that someone can vote twice.
It is necessary to provide better protection to whistleblowers, said Sir Eric.
It calls for greater press access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“This is done not only to protect against election fraud, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it,” he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street following a vote scandal at Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that incumbent Mayor Luftur Rahman should have been removed from office due to a long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman “cynically distorted” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, "was running his campaign on the basis that it was the duty of Muslim believers to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes raised doubts or were the result of personification, when a person votes, presenting himself as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern about mail-in voting fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly pressured people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system, including requiring you to bring your ID card to prove who you are.
The report said: “There has been evidence of pressure being exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, in particular women and young people, to vote at the will of their elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
“There were concerns that ... government agencies had turned a blind eye to such behavior because of the excessive sensitivity of ‘political correctness’ about ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including suspending political activists from working with postal ballots to stop the “harvest of votes.”
The report, under consideration by Theresa May, also calls for tighter checks at registration to prevent the use of a voter list for immigration and privilege fraud.
The option of requiring voters to present an identity card before voting is being considered.
Use indelible ink on people’s fingers as soon as they throw their ballot to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks on the nationality of people to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Introduce a three-year restriction on applications for automatic postal voting.
Dismiss political campaigners and activists from working with filled absentee ballots and envelopes with postal voting.
Give the police the authority to set boundaries around polling stations.
Amend the law to make it easier for people to be charged with intimidation under the Introduction of the People's Act 1983.
It is illegal to take pictures at polling stations.
Make it a requirement that only English be used at polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff forces voters to go to the booth one by one.
Sir Eric violently attacks the city police, stating that it is “stunning” that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlets case.
“The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal activities,” he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of reasonable doubt—the criminal standard of proof—for a number of reasons.
He also criticizes the unsuccessful “checks for the sake of ticking” of the electoral registration departments of city administrations.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s ruling by the Tower Hamlets court was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliamentary elections, yet the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Crazy bicycle analogue of Kate and other celebrity doppelgangers of the Rio Olympics
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio this week went crazy for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevo, who turned out to be impressively similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic athlete is far from the only athlete fighting for gold this summer to boast her own famous double — at least according to social media reports.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces appearing on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who have more than a superficial resemblance to Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archer team, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate’s double on the bike path, many people online hastened to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men’s archers team, caused the hurricane on Twitter after images appeared of him looking frighteningly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star.
And in fact, the archer learned about the madness of social media and admitted that he had heard that he looked like Leo since he was a child.
“I personally don’t see a huge resemblance, except maybe the vegetation on the face,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be pointed out even more this year: the striking similarity between British jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alia Mustafina, with her large expressive eyes, is said to be an exact replica of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool of the South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burg has been compared to the star of the Choir Matthew Morrison for many years.
Moving on to the more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan is a "sports version" of the actor "Beginnings"
Another long-standing comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who boast similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
Silver medalist swimmer from Russia Julia Efimova can boast not only the same tanned skin and blonde hair as the actress AnnaLynn McCord, while Nathan Adrian from the US team, according to fans, looks like a "sports version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt."
Raw Women: Football star Hope Solo, on the left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter of Dexter, on the right, have the same face and eye shapes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similar appearance of this pair
One Twitter user recently turned to the site to publicize her delight that “the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
In fact, U.S. soccer star and actress Dexter have incredibly similar face and eye shapes.
Other popular comparisons include Carrie Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautiful wide smile, which is similar to the smile of the star of "Get Happy."
CBC's Olympic commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Analysis of Byron McDonald fourth place at the finish of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at the women's freestyle relay 4x200 m outraged CBC viewers on Wednesday in a live broadcast of the Olympics
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “started like a stench” and “died like a pig” while swimming.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he began expressing his own opinion at the end of the final women's 4x200m freestyle relay.
You could hear MacDonald, who was brought in to the CBC commentator team to “dilute it with color,” say, “This 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby.”
Too excited, started like a stink, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanghan, who is 14 years old, swam the second stage of the relay in 1:57.79 – 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Cancer, allowing the Canadians to eliminate the backlog from China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and expressions used.
Emmett McFarlane tweeted: “Did the CBC announcer really just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China ‘died like a pig’????”
That idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
About Ai Yanhan from China in the final of the women's 4x200 m freestyle relay said: "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby."
Criticism on Twitter immediately hit Byron McDonald, with many calling for him to be fired
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron McDonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradise, tweeted: “Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and you make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize for the comment about the swimming performance being aired."
It was a bad choice of words, we are sorry it happened.
The IFOR concluded by apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to the statement.
A friend of the commentator Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of McDonald
The CBC then copied and sent their apologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald’s comments.
The network also hastened to apologize and publish a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to air.
Last night, we acted quickly to apologize to our live viewers and our social media followers.
Let’s be clear, Byron’s comments were about the swimmer’s performance, not about her as a person.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized live and tried to clarify his comment, saying he did not think his words would be interpreted as an attack on the person.
“I’d like to take this moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women’s relay,” he said on the CBC broadcast of the Olympics.
"I was talking about the swimmers' performance, not her in person."
"It goes without saying that there was no disrespect, and I'm very sorry."
Primark buyer insulted a woman who shamelessly tried on underwear in the middle of the store
Buyers didn’t know where to look when a woman was naked trying on panties, on the floor with shops in the middle of Primark.
Even worse, she tried on how she looked in them, pulled them down and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place department store in Folkestone.
The Primark shop of the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where a woman tried on knitted panties before putting them back on the shelf
The mother of two, Jenny Davidson, who was at the store at the time, said that after fitting underwear, the mysterious woman again "dressed up and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales hall, she took a pair of panties from the window, took off her own pantyhose and panties and put them on.
“She didn’t try to find a secluded place to do it – she just stood there, shameless.”
“Everyone got tired when she took off her panties again and she clearly didn’t like them because she put them back on the shelf.”
She did the same with the three other couples before finally deciding that there was nothing she liked about it, got dressed again, and left.
“It doesn’t look like she cared who was watching her, or that she thought about the person who would end up buying those panties she was trying on.”
Jenny Davidson, 33, from Kent, said: “It’s disgusting to think someone is going to take home underpants that someone else has already worn and they haven’t been washed.”
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: “I conclude that the staff apparently tried to remove these items from the sale after she left – well, all the better.”
“I wouldn’t want to come home with a new pair of women’s panties and find out that another woman put them on and took them off and they weren’t washed.”
A Primark spokesman said: “Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9th.
All the goods in question have been withdrawn from sale.
How to Protect Yourself from Gun Attacks Using a Krav Magi
The surrounding world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Ron Mizrachi, a master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York City, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether they approach you from the front or the back, this video will show you how to beat the robber with his own weapon.
If you are approaching from behind, according to Mizrachi, the first thing to do is to turn around so that you see the attacker and 'free the line of fire'.
You then grip the gun firmly between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow.
Then follows the knee in the groin, and while the attacker bends from the pain, you twist the gun out of his hands, hit him in the face with a barrel and go back, holding the weapon down on him.
For the armed, suitable front, the method of execution is similar - remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grab the gun and unscrew it so that the villain can not shoot.
At the same time, move the weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then turn the gun out of its grip before stepping back and aiming at it.

For a guidebook, the traveler Ian Wright guides his tongue through the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveler has put his immune system and gag reflex to a serious test, licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The host and author of travel books, Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, spent his tongue on the euro banknote, the railings of the Cirque Piccadilly, the toilet flush button on the train, and the Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment, which is supposed to be a movie called "The Inside Force Guide to the Traveler-Lysun," has produced some amazing results.
The thought of licking the flush button on a train that thousands of others use can be extremely disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip to Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and health workers about the increase in gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing licked brought him more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became famous for testing the strength of his intestines, traveling the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From public railings at train stations to flush toilet buttons, this task has undoubtedly tested his immune system.
In the film he shot, he said, "Since I was a child, I was completely carefree about my health and I pulled a lot of different things in my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His test swab demonstrated a luminometer value in excess of 4,000 units.
For comparison: just washed hands should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick, after the value of his luminometer was more than 4,000 units, while the newly washed hands show less than 60.
Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio made a film about the traveler called “The Inside Power Guide of the Traveler-Liseun,” which shows the number of bacteria in different places, for example, in the toilet.
In the film, he said, "It's close to one of the worst things I've smelled in the bathroom."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting.
The “Traveler-Lysun’s Guide to Inner Power” was filmed together with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human intestinal bacteria and develop the immune system.
Nico Vuorenmaa, Valio’s Senior Vice President of Snacks, Juices and New Categories, said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended with the idea of "let's call Jan."
They claim that interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in bowel health is a global phenomenon, and with the help of this documentary, we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting form.
I also think the movie shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Say it like this: I would lose respect for Ian if he licked some of the things I asked for, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."
Naturally, some things were easier for Jan to lick, and some were quite hard.
I’m glad we were able to film some of these licks.”
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria exclusively with good stomach and gut health, and 58 percent said they consumed, at least occasionally, foods containing added lactic acid bacteria.
A family of hooligans destroyed Saltash, Cornwall Municipal House, on the eve of eviction
A family of bullies left their municipal home at a loss of <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 after they were evicted for bullying their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcock were kicked out of their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evicted from the property, shocked officials of housing and construction cooperatives found the property in a condition requiring repair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, the halves were opened, debris was scattered across the floor and the walls were stained with graffiti.
The family is now resettled and is believed to be living in a private apartment.
Donna McAvoy, a settler at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid he could not be saved.
She said: “It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I don’t think people should live like that.
There are many things to consider because this property is likely to be known as a not very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation, and their name has a bad reputation.
The couple have three sons who have lived in the property from time to time, and police report that the reign of horror caused by the family included street fights with baseball bats, bullying residents of nearby neighborhoods, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screaming, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received a warrant for antisocial behavior in June.
In several rooms of the house, which can be demolished, found old garbage
Floorboards in the house where drugs were sold in the past were pulled out
Neighbors say they saw fights on the street and called the police regularly.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner this week after they were given an extended 11-week period for voluntary departure.
The eviction was greeted with relief by neighbors who said their lives had been turned into a living hell.
One said, "They didn't care."
We lived with them for 20 years, and it was always bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is incredible.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Housing neighborhood management team, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and in addition regularly called the police
Garbage and old toys were scattered below on the overgrown side of the municipal house
He added: “It’s a shame that the tenant couldn’t take any responsibility for the behavior of her and her family, as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing is considering.
It was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme, and their actions must have been terrifying to her observing neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community have put in to bravely come forward to give us the information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were all a little over 20 at the time.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after eviction
Resettlement workers will now have to remove the piles of garbage that surrounds the house
In 2014, police raided the house and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, as well as scales, matching accessories and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of Class B drugs for the purpose of supply.
She said the money went to pay for the tombstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After being made homeless, it is reported that Tanya and her partner now live in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms of the house were stained with graffiti all over the surface.
The police say they will try to evict tenants who do not comply with the rules of renting the premises.
Angela Crowe, of the Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
“This is a message for those who feel they can behave without the prosecutor’s accusations, as well as those who are harmed by such behavior,” she said.
Criminal and antisocial behavior will never be tolerated by the Devon and Cornwall Police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a low-flying military aircraft almost touched the beach
In the city of Aveiro in Portugal, tourists who love to bask in the sun, were terribly afraid for their lives
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low
The Air Force said he was conducting a training flight, but insisted there was no safety risk.
This is the moment when frightened tourists begin to panic, while the moment when a low-flying plane was talking over a crowded beach.
Dramatic footage shows a military plane flying close to touch from hunters on a strip of sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Vacationers jumped to their feet as soon as they became understandably preoccupied with the noise of the aircraft’s engines, but unable to see it moving in their direction through the clouds.
The incident occurred last night near the town of Aveiro in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several vacationers who posted a video of the shocking flyby on social media, said: “It flew very low twice, and there was a moment where it seemed like it was going to crash.”
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and I swear, there was a feeling that the plane was about to fall on me."
Tourists on Aveiro beach were horribly frightened when the plane came out of the fog and flew at an extremely low altitude.
Portugal’s Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was conducting a training flight to detect fishing vessels off the coast, and was forced to descend so low as it was the only way to test them.
The pilot said the plane flew slightly lower than usual due to insufficient visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted that no one was in danger.
This summer, wildfires damaged the Portuguese mainland and also claimed the lives of four people on the island of Madeira.
Portugal's air force said today that the pilot had to fly so low due to circumstances - thick fog and smog from forest fires that worsened visibility.
The aircraft performed a training flight, and the pilot was instructed to detect fishing boats as part of the task
The system has been mandatory for public catering for more than a year, but most cafes and restaurants in St. Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
Inspections are becoming more active, and businesses face fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system - a risk analysis and critical control points - has been mandatory for food manufacturers and carriers, as well as catering companies in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (CU).
Inspections of Rospotrebnadzor business for compliance with these standards in St. Petersburg began in February 2015.
But while officials issue fines only for certain violations of the regulations (see "List of documents"...).
Failure to comply with the regulations as a whole will cost the company 600 thousand rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles for the second.
HACCP as a system that takes into account the risks of working with food and prevents them, was invented in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about the safety of food for astronauts.
Now the system is used in all food enterprises not only in the United States, but also in Canada and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, HACCP has been operating in the territory of the CU.
For the development and implementation of the system, the business had 4 years (the requirement of the HACCP appeared in the technical regulation of the CU in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials admit that most companies have not even heard of this norm.
Unfortunately, for a long time we were sure that the norm applies only to food production, and not to restaurateurs, - explained the head of the Public Council Elena Tsereteli.
Now everyone is trying to make up for lost time.
The expected date of resumption of charter flights to Turkey is the end of August - the beginning of September.
But they will not cause a stir, as their target audience - families with children - is already preparing for school, experts say.
The Alliance of Travel Agencies sent a letter to the government yesterday asking it to allow charters now.
"For many Russian tourists, the issue of choosing a quality and affordable sea holiday is insoluble, since most of the accommodation facilities in the resorts of the Krasnodar Territory and the Republic of Crimea have already been booked until the end of September," the authors of the letter note and emphasize that the opening of charter flights in August will not significantly affect the already existing demand for Russian sea tourism products.
As reported in the North-Western regional branch of the Russian Union of travel industry (PCT), if the aviation agencies of Russia and Turkey quickly agree, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
There is no clear understanding when charters will be resumed, it depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, planes can fly in September, even August, if tour operators quickly build programs and agree with airlines on the necessary boards on the direction,” says Pavel Rumyantsev, Deputy Director for Communications and International Projects of the North-West Regional Branch of the PCT.
According to him, the possible resumption of charters is good news, but it will not affect the balance of power in the market, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from vacation and are preparing for school or spend holidays in other countries.
In the velvet season, tours are mainly bought by single travelers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to relax spontaneously,” says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists if it now gives very budget proposals - 50-60 thousand rubles for a tour for two, because there are people who are purposefully waiting for very cheap tours," says Valeria Rosenthal, CEO of Optio-Travel travel agency.
Otherwise, it is definitely not worth counting on the hype - the bulk of travel is already planned.
Pavel Rumyantsev also believes that since there is a demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be in demand, but the excitement should not wait.
“For Turkey, the launch of charters now is a rehearsal for next season,” says Pavel Rumyantsev.
“The opening of charters to Turkey is positive news for the next season,” Valery Rubtsova agrees.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption of compensation payments established by law within the approved norms related to compensation for damage caused by injury or other damage to health.
Issuance to workers engaged in work with harmful working conditions, milk according to the established standards is provided for in Article 222 of the TC of the Russian Federation.
At the same time, the norms and conditions of extradition are established by the order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia dated 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
According to this document, free distribution of milk or other equivalent food products is made to employees on the days of actual employment at work with harmful working conditions due to the presence of harmful production factors in the workplace.
Based on these norms, the Federal Tax Service of Russia in this letter came to the conclusion that on the basis of paragraph 2 of paragraph 3 of Article 217 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation are exempt from taxation of personal income tax income in the form of the value of milk issued to employees in the days of actual employment at work with harmful working conditions in accordance with the Norms and conditions approved by the order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia from 16.02.
Moscow "Gazstroybank" was left without a license of the Central Bank.
On Friday, August 12, 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked the license to conduct banking operations with the credit organization Joint-Stock Commercial Bank "GAZSTROYBANK", registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, JSC JSCB "GAZSTROYBANK" conducted a high-risk credit policy related to the placement of funds in low-quality assets.
An adequate assessment of the risks taken at the request of the supervisory authority and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank's assets led to the credit institution to take measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, the credit institution was involved in dubious transit operations.
The bank has appointed a temporary administration for the period of validity until the moment of appointment to the competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit organization in accordance with federal laws are suspended.
JSC JSCB "GAZSTROYBANK" is a participant of the deposit insurance system.
Recall that the payment of insurance indemnity to depositors of the bank, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with the Federal Law No. 177-FZ "On Insurance of Deposits of Individuals in Banks of the Russian Federation" is provided in the amount of 100% of the balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million rubles in total per depositor.
Payments, according to the Deposit Insurance Agency, will begin no later than August 26, 2016.
According to the reporting data, by the size of assets of JSC "GAZSTROYBANK" as of August 1, 2016 took 335 place in the banking system of the Russian Federation.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS dies in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnim Akundji said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is believed to have died from a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, a stronghold of the group in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
The Sultan was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just as she was planning to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only advantage of all this - as a tombstone and a testament to others - that these are the risks that are discussed when traveling to the war zone - to dissuade people from ever making the same choice," Akundzhi said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then took a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan’s family said she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow for several months.
Reid says Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as Supreme Court candidate if elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is confident Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected as president.
Senate Republicans blocked Garland’s claim, as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person who can replace the last Supreme Court Justice, Antonina Scalia.
Reid said in a conference call on Thursday that he predicts Clinton will choose Garland “with some degree of confidence.”
A spokeswoman for Reed later said he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland, and was just making assumptions.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team would not want to “rock the boat” with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid said the Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are "challengers" and "accomplices" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is not fit for office.
Treats states that erotic calendars are for 'women as well as men'
Treats magazine is partnering with photographer David Bellmer to release a 2017 calendar inspired by the 1970s Pirelli.
But instead of nude celebrities, they set out to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with nude muse.
The president of Treats, Steve Shaw, told us earlier this year that his magazine with more nude models is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because “Playboy is for men.”
I make it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar does, too.
“We need to go back to the demonstration of the eternal and classic nude figure, where women, like men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body,” Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be a part of this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photos online or in person at open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
Muscovites will be handed out reminders about unfair online stores.
In Moscow, they are going to release a memo that will tell you how not to become a victim of an online store.
This was reported in Rospotrebnadzor, writes M24.
It is reported that the experts of the department are preparing a memo that will help citizens to choose the right online store and recognize possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of this brochure is divided into several sections.
These will be general information and legislative framework, rules for the delivery of goods, ways to protect their legal rights.
The annex will provide recommendations on how to make a claim and so on," Rospotrebnadzor said.
The souvenir is currently being finalized.
Subsequently, it will be posted on the website of Rospotrebnadzor in Moscow, it is also planned to release a printed version and distribute it to Muscovites.
The Russian Foreign Ministry published a statement in which it named the second suspect in the organization of sabotage in the Crimea.
Persons from among the citizens of Ukraine and Russia who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts were detained.
Among them are Panov Evgeny Alexandrovich and Zakhtei Andrey Romanovich.
“They all give a confession,” the statement said.
Earlier, a resident of the Zaporozhye region Yevgeny Panov, who was detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in the Crimea, admitted his guilt at the interrogation.
The FAS will fine Google 438 million rubles.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine on Google in the amount of 438 million rubles, according to the agency's website.
"The fine for Google for violation of antimonopoly legislation amounted to 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will implement our decision and pay the fine in the near future,” said Alexei Dotsenko, deputy head of the FAS.
In the course of the investigation, the FAS found that Google supplies manufacturers of smartphones that are sold in Russia, the Google Play app store only on the condition that the device will be installed and other applications of the corporation.
Among these applications there is a search engine, which should be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates Part 1 of Article 10 of the Federal Law "On Protection of Competition" (abuse of a dominant position).
We are confident that the implementation of the regulation will provide an opportunity for the development of competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a beneficial effect on our consumers.
The Law "On Protection of Competition" must be observed by all companies whose products are supplied to the territory of the Russian Federation, and transnational corporations, including," said Elena Zaeva, Head of the Department for Regulation of Communications and Information Technologies of the FAS of Russia.
The agency suspects the collusion of 16 Russian stores.
The New Book Network has been fined for selling a book called 50 Days Before My Suicide.
The chain of stores "New book" fined for selling the book by Stace Kramer "50 days before my suicide", according to the city news Agency "Moscow".
According to Rospotrebnadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be considered as "provocative or motivating to suicidal behavior of children and adolescents."
The Ostankino District Court confirmed the violation of the established requirements for the distribution of information products among children and decided to impose a penalty in the form of a fine with the confiscation of 49 copies of printed products arrested by the Rospotrebnadzor Department.
A source in The New Book confirmed that it was a work by Stace Kramer.
In March of this year, it was reported that the largest bookstores in Moscow are checked for the presence of the book "50 days before my suicide."
In Moscow, an evening of memory of Ernst the Unknown will be held.
In Moscow will host an evening in memory of the sculptor Ernst Neizvestny, reports TASS.
The event will take place on August 15 at the Central House of Writers.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to the Unknown in the US in person.
Therefore, it was decided to organize this evening for those who want to remember it in their native land," the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress said.
It was noted that this is important for the widow of the sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
Close friends of Unknown were invited to the evening, including poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, artist Boris Messerer, President of Pushkin State Museum Irina Antonova, director Mark Rozovsky, as well as Minister of Culture of Russia Vladimir Medinsky, Head of the Department of Culture of Moscow Alexander Kibovsky, Deputy Mayor of Moscow Leonid Pechatnikov.
Earlier it was reported that relatives of Ernst Unknown plan to hold a memorial service for the sculptor in New York, presumably, until August 14.
The end user of vinyl: who actually buys records?
Single middle-aged men love vinyl.
And as long as you do not rush to clog the comments section with rude insults under the pseudonym Non-Single Men of Middle Years, this statement follows from the actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed revival of records is not due to the boom among the generation of two thousand who want to imbue themselves with the novelty of a material object, but the nostalgia of middle-aged people.
Those who have recently bought a c vinyl album are more likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54, according to the data.
Moreover, those who belong to the age group of 18-24 years are the least likely.
It’s also not just an act of collecting by amateurs – it has an emotional meaning: older vinyl buyers are somewhat more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov’s results accurate?
If this blog had been a TV news report, the camera would have followed me as I walked down the middle of the busy Soho Street, in a modest gray suit and gesticulating violently before the stop, folding my arms and saying something impressive like, “Okay, let’s see.”
All right, let's see.
While the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm and dirt – hotels, cafes, Paperchase shops are now filling the buildings once occupied by independent sellers – several music stores with fantastic specialists still remain.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene where I’m close to different people in some of these stores and trying to gauge their age and emotional state through observation.
A native of Glasgow, Stewart, 55, followed me from Sister Ray (counting data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counting data: eight middle-aged men, one woman probably over 20), in London for half a day to hold a meeting, and strolling around the shops to take a few hours.
He's a collector, I ask?
"I suppose so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, pictured above (he emailed me a picture, I didn’t chase him home), run in lines along the walls of his living room.
His reason for acquiring so many albums and singles is partly due to his disposable income: he can now buy records he couldn’t afford when they first came out and buy back the items he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of what I'm getting is the late '60s, early '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things that I was probably too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are most likely introverts who like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
It's my fault.
Wez, a 25-year-old who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets fit the profile of YouGov.
He noticed, however, a new wave of people under the influence of media hype, people who heard about the return and felt the obligation to buy back their old records.
Judging by the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their records,” he says.
This could explain the boom in vinyl revival figures of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of records?
Just spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to understand that record stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Uez, some older customers, in particular, are offended by the cashless payment system.
Some vinyl aficionados may feel overwhelmed by the digital world and prefer to retreat into the permanence of familiar vinyl envelopes, objects that evoke memories of serene youth.
“I think sometimes it can be filling a void or having material things as a kind of comfort,” says Wez.
Since I’m a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people have it, too.
It's an easy way to occupy your head.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from the record rack.
An ICM poll in April found that nearly 50% of people who bought a vinyl album last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a player they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl do not have a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look seriously puzzled, leafing through the rack of Bosanoff's collections.
The "trophy" aspect of the revival is what Johnny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe, noticed.
“Someone came in recently and said, ‘I don’t have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf,’” he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More of the product, less of the music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older, they are a little under twenty, who are just getting acquainted with this.
Fopp, who has now taken away almost the entire vinyl floor, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
There are couples who are over 70, tourists who take pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less casual than in the above-mentioned stores - the latest synth and sexy-pop Wild Beast, not jazz improvisation, breaks through the speakers - it's nice to see the variety in their customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but painful psychological trauma is difficult to establish standing for 30 seconds next to someone.
Eleonora, 27, walked around Fopp for a few minutes, looking at various records available for sale.
She looks at the goods, not spends money.
She doesn’t earn much, she says, so collecting records isn’t a very suitable option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simple, but the beauty of vinyl is ...” – it plunges into dreams with a sigh full of love.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a store that is said to have contributed to a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Fashionistas.
As I create the illusion that I’m looking at denim-fitting shorts, I’m watching a group of teenage girls gather around Polaroid’s camera every minute before a father and his daughter start discussing buying a Crosley player.
On the left is a staircase, the wall of which is lined with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mack: a mixture of modern style and classics, mandatory records for any medium-sized collection.
No one is looking – perhaps because they are just an ornament, some are located so high up on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's real vinyl art.
But given that any attention to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the outback of Soho for a while yet, there’s almost nothing to complain about.
It is not surprising that the population that is more likely than most to have more time and money than most is the one that spends the most money on luxury items such as vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov’s results are accurate, at least in Soho record stores, they don’t rule out the existence of the vast number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in reality, in record stores and on online forums.
These people probably work full-time at school or in offices.
But they clearly don’t spend Thursday mornings strolling through record stores on Berwick Street, flipping through records and avoiding the eyes of the nasty 30-year-old fake host who hangs over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland polar shark is the longest-living vertebrate – video report
Scientists say that the Greenland polar shark has the longest life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, states that the record was set by a female aged 272 to 512 years and five meters long.
French court rejects proposal to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a proposal by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At court hearings this week, Calais authorities said the state should be able to demolish a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or the simplest dishes for a few euros at makeshift restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais has argued that these places should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that pays no taxes and because they carry fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing camp population.
They argued that home-made shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
Lille’s court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel the people running 72 home-made stores, but said the problems of Calais prefecture “were fully understood.”
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said grocers, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than just feeding people who “live in extremely shaky conditions.”
He said the spaces provided quiet meeting points for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened with demolition was the Jungle Book Children's Café at the camp, which works not for profit and offers 200 lunches a day, English and French classes, and advice on providing shelter for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children’s cafe.
A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are no older than eight years".
Two charities, Aid to Refugees and L’Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number at the Jungle camp had risen to more than 9,000 people — the highest ever — after a sharp increase in new arrivals over the summer.
The libraries of the microdistricts invite young freelancers to educational programs.
This week, branch libraries will hold meetings dedicated to the Day of the City, the Year of Russian Cinema and even the Day of the Athlete.
The programs are aimed at the children's audience, so most of them will be held in the form of a game.
Today, August 10, the branch library No. 2, in the suburban area, invites to the cruise presentation "My City is small."
On August 11, the library branch No. 1 will host a local history lesson "I live in this city, I know this city."
In the library-branch No. 2 on the same day, a multimedia lesson "Homeland past fate" will be held.
And in the library-branch No. 4 in Surazhevka - the game program "Film, film, film".
On Sunday, August 14, for the guys from the northern microdistrict, the library-branch No. 3 will hold a game program "Physical-hello!".
Britain stops at silver in rugby-7 after Fiji master class allows them to take gold
The UK’s impressive series in Rugby 7 was crushed by Fiji’s final hurdle in the final on Thursday night, when they were completely defeated 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class on ball possession, unwrapping, evasion, supporting the game, running the lines and brute force to win gold – their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came with not-so-poor solace in the form of silver – Britain’s third in a day – and they could be proud of their efforts in the first-ever Rugby 7 Olympic tournament, which beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa on the way.
The painful beating of the Boxes, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day, could have come back to negatively affect them in the final.
But, despite everything, Fiji in this form won the best team of 15 people.
It may be some consolation for the UK – but probably not – that at least one Briton will hang a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: Fijian head coach Ben Ryan, a former England boss from Wimbledon.
It was a journey for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
These blows will cause pain, but the progress is astonishing.
Fiji started great, for fun beating off attempts by the UK to intercept the ball.
It was like bumping into a column of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau dived into the corner.
Having four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuway added another touchdown on the right flank, which was implemented.
12-0 and the UK barely touched the ball.
A brilliant attempt to intercept Mitchell kept mountain man Leon Nakarava from scoring a third, but this only delayed Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua made a touchdown in the right corner, and the UK lost 17-0.
Nakarava added another one after the resumption and there was still more than a minute on the clock...in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovo then broke through several more sluggish attempts to intercept the UK and stormed the line to score a point.
The implementation led to 29-0 in the break.
It looked as if Fiji were born to play rugby-7, while the UK still owns the craft.
Which, to a large extent, it is.
Britain made massive substitutions at half-time, and they clogged the Fijian dam... for all four minutes, which by the standards of the first half was good, until Joshua Tuisov passed after a few brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton grabbed an attempt for the UK by making a touchdown in the left corner to make the score 36-7, but the game had long been in the way of South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was impossible not to admire Fiji’s joyful approach.
Mata William embellished a Fijian cake that didn’t need embellishment, another attempt in the last seconds.
A whistle sounded, the Fijians embraced, and Great Britain fell on the lawn, completely defeated.
Earlier in the day, Fiji beat Japan 20-5 in their semi-finals, and the UK slightly overtook South Africa in a tense one-hit semi-final – the difference of the British implementation.
Kyle Brown takes Boxing forward in the first half, but Dan Norton with some great footwork broke the line and scored under the beams in the second half.
A brilliant last attempt at interception from Marcus Watson, England's 15th brother, Anthony, secured the victory - and eventually a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win in the rowing fight of the coach with cancer
There will be no more exciting gold in these games, and that says something.
From the first move to the last, 220 hard climbs in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have found the added value of their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the oars, there were three voices in this boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams has always been as long as they aspired to the second consecutive Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in the annals of British sport to reach such heights.
Their superiority was absolute, in the end it was their 39th undefeated performance, again unprecedented.
What we see is that two brilliant female athletes sliding across the surface with the elegance of a swan do not fully reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind every gold was a battalion of ready-made hands, contributing to incremental victories that mattered, and there were no hands that were more important than the hands of a coach who, 30 months ago when he was diagnosed with cancer, didn’t know if he would live to see that day.
Like he said, it was a dangerous case.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate on, and they did it.
If they don't, he goes everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes your outlook for the future a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky that he could start treatment in early 2014 in the off-season, keeping the schedule gap minimal if that could be the correct expression in circumstances like these.
I needed to pay, so I needed to recover quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walking around the ward — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, even though they said it was a few steps enough.
That's how it starts.
The rowing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little more.
The moment after the victory, their first thoughts were of Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, an artillery regiment captain with service in Afghanistan, said: “I was an emotional wreck this week, maybe it’s a little too much, but it means so much.”
It just goes to show how much it means to me, how much Helen and I have worked, and so has Robin.
It’s been a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be nothing, so thank you very much to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t ask for a better coach or a better partner.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in five years.
This pair sets a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very much in phase.
Helen called out, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
Now it is very important not to get carried away.
We had a good start, and at the same time we did not try to do something amazing.
We weren’t expecting fireworks today, we were just expecting to be able to row well and get out and win the race, which is what we did.
It will take a couple of years to decide their future.
Glover needs to be at the wedding next month, on her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
She just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to realize that I had become an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel so much better,” she said.
The government has extended the period of destruction of sanctioned products
The government has extended until the end of 2017 the deadline for the destruction of food products prohibited for import to Russia.
The relevant decree was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, it is published on the official portal of legal information.
The embargo against countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions due to the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
Subsequently, the ban was repeatedly extended, now it is valid until December 31, 2017.
It is forbidden to import certain types of agricultural products, raw materials and food from the USA, EU countries, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, the ban included meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products.
Disposal of food imported into the country bypassing the embargo has been carried out in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of prohibited products were withdrawn from sale.
The “Prohibitor” Hunt

The WTO panel of arbitrators found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil are contrary to the rules of the organization.
Import rates exceed the commitments made by Russia when it joined the WTO.
“This is the first time that the WTO has taken a decision against Russia,” the organization said in a statement on its website.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the EU did not provide sufficient evidence that Russia’s measures were “systematic” or “comprehensive.”
Russia, in turn, promised to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is stated in the message of the Ministry of economic development of Russia.
On July 4, it was reported that Kiev intends to complain to the World Trade Organization about the actions of Russia, which introduced additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times reported that the U.S. behavior in resolving disputes at the WTO undermines the organization’s principles of discussion.
A similar statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members because of the refusal of the Americans to approve for a second term the South Korean judge Chang Song Hwa.
In this regard, Russia will not appeal to the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It now consists of 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
In the presidential administration, the head of
Russian President Vladimir Putin has appointed Anton Vaino as head of his own administration, former Deputy Sergei Ivanov.
Vladimir Putin has reshuffled the presidential administration and expressed hope that the new head of his administration will contribute to the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Vaino said during the meeting that he considers the anti-corruption work, which he began to carry out as head of the administration of President Ivanov, to be important, and promised to cooperate with the government.
Earlier, Izvestia wrote that experts believe that the situation with the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the post of the head of the administration is transparent and understandable, and the perestroika will not fundamentally change anything in the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the head, who led the work in the presidential administration for a long time, effectively built the activities of the AP.
Instead of him came Deputy Head of Administration Anton Vaino - a person who knows the specifics of this work.
In Poland, they admit that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The state-owned Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not exclude that in a few years gas supplies from Russia may become unattractive for it due to reorientation to fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the vice-president of the Polish company for finance Bogus<0xC5><0x82>aw Ma<0xC5><0xBC>ec.
His words are conveyed by Tass.
“It may happen that we will not buy gas [from Gazprom] at all, we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main areas of supply for us will be the East, raw materials from LNG terminals and Norway,” said Ma<0xC5><0xBE>ec.
Currently, Gazprom occupies a dominant position in gas supplies to Poland.
On Friday, August 12, PGnig reported that the Russian supplier in the first half of 2016 supplied it with almost 5.3 billion cubic meters of gas, which is 30% higher than the level of 2015.
The Russian gas giant’s share in PGNIG’s purchases rose to 49.8% from 40% a year earlier.
Recall that on July 22, the antimonopoly authority of Poland did not agree on the creation of a joint venture between Gazprom and its European partners for the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
At the same time, a month earlier, Poland left a request to Gazprom for the supply of 11 billion cubic meters of gas through Nord Stream 2.
This was stated by Deputy Chairman of the Board of the holding Alexander Medvedev.
The auction for the capacity of Nord Stream 2 will take place in 2017, and in the autumn of 2016 it is planned to hold an auction for its laying.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom does not plan to take any action in connection with the intentions of the Polish side to abandon long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, said Deputy Chairman of the Board of the company Alexander Medvedev.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, the Poles only increased by 42% the purchase of gas from the Russian Federation.
Gazprom’s deputy chairman added that the very fact of filing a statement by Poland’s PGNIG with the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not mean the termination of negotiations.
Earlier, the Polish company appealed to the court to achieve a reduction in the purchase price of Russian gas.
We will remind, the Commissioner of the Polish government on gas and energy infrastructure Peter Naimsky said that the Polish authorities have decided not to extend the contract with Gazprom for the supply of gas.
Poland’s contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish government’s commissioner for gas and energy infrastructure, Piotr Naimski, said that his country could abandon the supply of blue fuel from the east in six years.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.
Nord Stream 2 envisages the construction of two offshore gas pipelines with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year from Russia to Germany along the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near Ukraine’s border with Crimea.
This was reported by the first Deputy Head of the SMM in Ukraine Alexander Hug.
"I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area," he said, answering a question from journalists.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is calm, there are no incidents affecting security.
The SMM monitored the situation at three checkpoints across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
In the Network there was a video of the passenger plane Yak-42 landing at the Ufa airport, which rolled outside the runway for 400 meters and collapsed on the left wing.
The video was published by the TV channel “360”.
The emergency happened at 4.30 Moscow time.
The flight of the airline "KrasAvia" arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, there were no casualties.
The aircraft itself was transported to the parking lot.
Ufa airport is operating normally.
The Volga Investigative Department on transport TFR was engaged in finding out the reason for the hard landing of the aircraft liner.
The United Nations is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN special commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN special envoy for Syria, Stephane de Mistura, believes the fact of what happened is indisputable.
Such statements were made on the eve of the third round of intra-Syrian talks, which are due to begin in late August in Geneva.
UN experts have launched an investigation into reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information about the attack using toxic gas, presumably chlorine, appeared on August 2.
Then the opposition said that in the area where the Russian military transport helicopter was shot down the day before, the air force dropped bombs with a poisonous substance, but in Moscow these accusations were called a throw.
Later, the Russian Defense Ministry accused the opposition group “Harakat Nur ad-Din al-Zinki” of the incident.
Soon it became known that there were two bombs filled with toxic gas.
This was confirmed by the BBC by one of the victims.
“A few minutes later, I felt the smell of gas, the eyes began to burn, it became difficult to breathe,” the source said.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people were killed, 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts, the actions will be considered a war crime.
UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura told reporters: “There is a lot of evidence that this really happened.”
The inadmissibility of the use of chlorine for military purposes is enshrined in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
Despite the fact that all parties to the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights activists recorded 35 cases of the use of chlorine by the Syrian army against the “moderate opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that shelling of its districts is carried out daily, and terrorists prevent the withdrawal of residents from the city.
According to Reuters, the UN expects Russia to establish a “humanitarian pause” in hostilities.
The current regime of daily three-hour lull in the organization is considered "insufficient to help almost 2 million civilians trapped."
Staffan de Mistura's humanitarian adviser, Jan Egeland, said a 48-hour ceasefire would be required to deliver aid to the city and evacuate the sick and wounded every week.
“We have to send bulky cargoes from the convoy of trucks in areas where the roads are almost destroyed, and the remaining ones are mined,” Mr. Egeland said.
Consultations in Geneva between representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a “humanitarian pause” continue.
How Russia opened “humanitarian windows” in Aleppo
Amid the ongoing battle for Aleppo, Syria’s second-largest city, Russia announced on Aug. 11 a three-hour cessation of hostilities regime that will operate daily from Thursday.
The creation of “humanitarian windows” is intended to provide conditions for the delivery of medicines, food and essential goods to the city.
The decision of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation was made against the background of increasing international pressure on Moscow with the requirement to curtail the military operation and contribute to the resumption of the negotiation process.
As a result of a series of explosions in the resorts of Thailand killed four people.
There were several explosions in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
The attack killed four people and injured 19.
The epicenter of the explosions fell on the city of Hua Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, citizens of four states, there are no Russians among them.
Responsibility for the incident has not yet taken any of the terrorist groups, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the country hastened to declare that the Islamists are not involved in it.
Several people have already been arrested on suspicion of organizing the bombings.
According to preliminary data of the local police, the scale and features of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the military leaders of the country.
The attacks took place at popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in the Phuket area and the cities of Hua Hin, Trang and Surat Thani.
After the military junta came to power in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2% (2012) to 2.8% (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries to demonstrate development.
In 2016, the country has already been visited by 14 million people, which is 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attacks have already been detained, police Colonel Chrisana Patanacharoen said.
It is too early to talk about the goals, he added, but the interior Ministry countries "are sure that they are not associated with international extremist groups."
“It is too early to draw conclusions,” said Mr. Patanacharoen.
But we know for sure that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact they are local sabotage, and we are trying to establish the identities of those behind them.
The blasts occurred on the birthday of Thailand’s Queen Sikrit.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy one of its top priorities, so the incident is likely to be directed against it.
According to Police General Sithicha Srisopacharoenrata, the bombs were detonated remotely, half an hour apart.
They were hidden inside trees on busy streets filled with diner tourists.
One in four people killed was a Thai girl who sold street food.
The identity of the other victims is not yet known, but it is known that they are residents of four foreign countries.
According to the Royal Thai Police, among them are four citizens of Germany, three citizens of the Netherlands, two citizens of Italy and a citizen of Austria.
There are no Russians among the victims of the explosions, the press service of Rosturizm reported.
Local experts also link the bombings to the referendum held on August 7, in which 61.4% of the country's population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a commission to draft a constitution, appointed by the military junta.
Voters had to decide whether they supported a system in which the upper house of parliament was fully appointed by the military and played a significant role in the election of the country’s prime minister.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Recall that on May 22, 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the country's army commander Prayut Chan-Och.
This step, he said, was prompted by an ongoing political crisis and a lack of progress in negotiations between the government and the opposition.
The military created the National Peace and Order Council, imposed curfews and censorship, dispersed protesters and the upper house of parliament.
Bangkok is in a state of emergency.
The Thai government, led by Prime Minister Yingluck Chinawat, declared a state of emergency in Bangkok and the surrounding provinces in January 2014.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
There were two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, in the center of Bangkok near the Victory Monument, where one of the main protests took place, there were two explosions, which injured 28 people, five of them were in critical condition.
The explosions were carried out by unknown motorcyclists.
Authorities have stepped up security measures in the capital and enlisted military forces to protect protesters.
In Sukhoi Log, the development of conditions began.
As it became known to Kommersant, the government was asked to agree on the draft terms of the auction for the Sukhoi Log gold deposit, while maintaining two key restrictions.
It is proposed to prevent companies where 25% or more belongs to foreigners and those applicants whose capital will not be at least 25% state participation.
Industry participants do not expect the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players do not risk taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auction can be announced in August, and held in October.
The Ministry of Natural Resources submitted to the government a draft order and auction conditions for the largest undeveloped gold deposit in Russia Sukhoi Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), two sources familiar with the situation told Kommersant.
The project was submitted on Wednesday evening, one of them clarifies.
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed to Kommersant that the project was submitted to the government.
Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Khloponin’s representative in charge of subsoil use told Kommersant that the project has not yet been submitted to the official’s office.
“The auction can be announced in August, immediately after the government order, and taking into account the deadline for the collection of applications of potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender can be held in October,” the ministry said.
According to Kommersant, the project retained two key requirements for potential participants, spelled out in the version that was sent for approval to ministries and IDFs in July (Kommersant has one).
The first is the presence of at least 25% of state participation in the capital of the applicants.
The second is the refusal of access to the auction for companies controlled by foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 about foreign investments in strategic companies.
According to the two articles of the Federal Law specified in the draft, as Kommersant wrote on August 2, companies whose beneficiaries (25% of shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship may not be allowed to participate in the auction.
The government has the right to impose such restrictions, since Sukhoi Log belongs to the subsoil of federal importance (stocks of more than 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed that the project "contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies", but refused to comment on the details before the government order.
The demand for state participation in the capital of the auction participants was put forward by the Irkutsk region, said in December 2015 "Kommersant" in the Ministry of Natural Resources and later confirmed by the Governor of the region Sergey Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Natural Resources by his predecessor Sergei Eroshchenko, "who had agreements on investment projects with Rostec."
Who lobbied for the restriction on the admission of foreigners, the interlocutors of Kommersant do not specify.
"But this is in the spirit of the times: not to give control in the largest gold deposit in Russia against the background of Western sanctions," the interlocutor of Kommersant, who is familiar with the preparation of the auction, says.
On August 1, the head of the Ministry of Natural Resources, Sergei Donskoy, stated that foreigners "can go to the consortium" if the applicants attract them "as a financial structure, technological partners."
The interlocutors of Kommersant believe that it is unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The main contender for Sukhoi Log in the industry is the consortium of the largest gold miner of the Russian Federation, PJSC Polyus, controlled by the son of Suleiman Kerimov Said, and Rostec.
According to Kommersant, in July, the partners created the joint venture SL Gold, where Polyus has 51% of the shares, and the structure of Rostec RT-GR has 49%.
In "Rostec" refused to comment, in "Polus" said "Kommersant" that "certainly interested in this asset" and have all the necessary competencies and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the announcement of the conditions," Polyus added.
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision is up to the Russian government, Kommersant sources said.
About the possibility of participating in the development of Dry Log stated the Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, developing assets in Chukotka, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to Kommersant, are not interested in the asset.
The head of the Union of gold miners of the Russian Federation Sergey Kashuba in December 2015 estimated "Kommersant" investments in Sukhoi Log in $ 2.5-4 billion.
Most potential applicants scare away not only the amount of investment, but also the complexity of the project: a serious additional exploration of reserves and technology for working with complex ores is needed, Kommersant’s interlocutors in the industry explain.
In the pension market launched the largest M&A deal - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" launched the process of combining four controlled NPFs.
As a result, on the basis of the "Gazfond Pension savings" will be created NPF with a volume of savings of about 373 billion rubles.
About the launch of the procedure for the merger of four pension funds - "KIT Finance", "Promagrofond", "Heritage" and "Gazfond Pension savings" - yesterday said the owner of 100% of funds LLC "KIT Finance Pension Administrator".
"The reorganization is carried out in coordination with the Central Bank, subject to the requirement of non-deterioration of the terms of existing contracts," the company said in a statement.
The association is held on the basis of "Gazfond Pension savings".
As the general director of this NPF, Oleg Bia<0xC5><0x82>ositski, notes, the pooling of funds allows to solve several tasks: expanding the geography of presence, concentrating resources for development, reducing costs, replicating the best practices of each of the funds and optimizing corporate governance.
According to him, the estimated period of completion of consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of NPF "Gazfond Pension savings" will become the largest player in the OPS market.
As of March 31, the volume of pension savings of the combined funds exceeded 373 billion rubles.
As follows from the reporting on the website of the funds, the beneficiaries of their owner - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" - are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (through LLCs controlled by 65%) and NPF "Gazfond" (35%).
However, the merger itself group launched much later competitors.
Thus, controlled by the group O1 NPF "Future" absorbed "Stalfund" at the beginning of this year.
Currently, this joint NPF joins the Uralsib and Russian Standard funds.
"Unification into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to solve structural problems," said Nikolai Sidorov, general director of NPF "Future".
Active work on the consolidation of funds since April is underway in the pension group "Safmar" - NPF "European", "Education and Science" and "Region Fund" should join the NPF "Safmar" until the end of this year.
In 2017, they will be joined by the NPF “Trust”.
“The pooling of funds will have the effect of strengthening control over risks, operational processes and costs,” Safmar said.
The pause in the pool of funds, which was sustained by the "KIT Finance Pension Administrator", can be caused by several reasons, experts say.
Until recently, NPFs could not redeem more than 40% of the volume of infrastructural bonds in which the group was actively placed.
After the amendments to the Central Bank’s resolution in March this year, a number of issuers that meet the requirements of the regulator no longer have such restrictions.
If necessary, the entire issue can be redeemed by one major player,” points out the director of the rating group of financial institutions ACRA Yuri Nogin.
Several leaders of the NPF from the top 15 on assets another possible reason for the pause is the separation of spheres of influence and, as a result, staff appointments in a single fund, which had to be agreed by the owners of the group.
Yesterday, Anatoly Gavrilenko was unavailable for comment.
The request of "Kommersant" in the NPF "Gazfond" was also not answered.
Although the consolidation of funds is a laborious and expensive event, in the long run this decision will be justified.
According to the general director of the consulting company "Pension Partner" Sergey Okolesnov, "Gazfond Pension savings" less outflows, accession will stabilize the base of other funds of the group.
At the same time, more successful experience of NPF "KIT Finance" and "Promagrofonda" in building retail sales of OPS, as well as the use of more modern software will be required.
The requirements of the Central Bank to the processes and personnel of the NPF are constantly growing, so it is not advisable to duplicate the infrastructure on four funds with a single investment policy, says Pavel Mitrofanov, Managing Director for Corporate Ratings Expert RA.
"The effect of reducing the duplicate functions will definitely cover the possible costs of the merger," Mitrofanov said.
The cost of combining the four funds Sergey Okolesnov estimates at 30-50 million rubles.
"The cost of maintaining four funds of this size is about 400 million rubles. per year, with consolidation in the medium term, the budget can really be reduced by half," - said Mr. Okolesnov.
The best Disney movie "Pete and His Dragon" was released in Russia.
Beautiful views of New Zealand, a cuddly dragon, a heartwarming story and country-style songs are enough to believe in old-fashioned magic again, says Elena Kravtsun.
The frightened baby was picked up by a dragon, who became a human cub and a gentle nanny, and a devoted friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, in honor of the puppy from the book of fairy tales, plays catch-up with him and falls asleep in the embrace.
Six years later he, overgrown and in a loincloth, can no longer be distinguished from another clever forest hunter - Mowgli.
In this form, Pete discovers a red-haired woman-egger Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while the brigade of Gavin (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, aggressively plows the forest.
Now she will have to not only believe in the existence of the dragon, but also help save it.
Pete undergoes an accelerated course of “being human” surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, have a moral code in their heart, and smile more dazzlingly than in any commercial.
No character looks or acts too horrible to be truly hated or feared by the viewer.
Even Gavin, who opened a hunt for an atypical inhabitant of the forests under his control, is far from an incorrigible villain.
A huge fluffy dragon also turned out not at all scary, with a good muzzle of a bulldog, the airliner wingspan and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon grunts funny, purrs, even grunts and, fortunately, does not talk, but he always wants to stroke, this is what distinguishes him from all known cinematic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner of holding on provide such a high degree of emotional involvement that in the most tense moments, not only small viewers but also adults begin to cry desperately in three streams.
Amazingly good and underage Oaks Figley as Pete, torn between a possible family and a true friend.
And Robert Redford virtuosoly betrays the canonical grandfather, which would be happy to have literally every child.
How did director David Lowry manage to make a fantastically cute remake of the forgotten 1977 Disney film “Pete’s Dragon,” mediocre from nose to tail and remembered only as a mix of animation and feature film, and make it the most soulful film of this summer?
It was a miracle that helped.
In his painting Lowry from the original, in fact, took only two things: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
There were musical numbers and most of the strange jokes.
This good fairy tale reads features borrowed from "Bambi", "Alien" and many other heart-loving children's paintings.
Disney continues to successfully expand the gallery of high-quality remakes of the XXI century.
Of course, "Pete and the Dragon" is not as stunningly beautiful as the same "Jungle Book", and there is no skilled villain, as was Kate Blanchett in the role of stepmother in the new "Cinderella".
But this naive film no less successfully helps to believe in miracles and good in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, the keys to the magical castle of Disney director Lowry will receive once again - for the artistic film adaptation of the story about "Peter Pan".
Worked in "Pete and his dragon" tandem David Lowry and screenwriter Toby Halbrooks entered into a new ambitious project about a boy not growing up according to the fairy tale of the same name by James Barry.
RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov to face new charges
Lawyers of RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the activities of the extremist structure, said that the prosecutor's office found flaws in the case of their client.
That the Prosecutor’s office made such a presentation, we learned from the investigators just yesterday.
We planned to participate in the court session on the issue of limiting the familiarization with the materials of the criminal case, but the meeting did not take place in the end, and the investigators informed us about the submission made by the prosecutor’s office,” said lawyer Olga Dinze.
She said that the prosecutor's office pointed out to the investigators the inconsistency of the qualification of the case and the collected materials.
Now the investigators will have to eliminate the gaps in the evidence base and present a new charge to Alexander Sokolov.
Either another article of the Criminal Code will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, Ms. Dinze clarifies.
According to Kommersant, Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded from the accusation to the RBC journalist the wording about “shattering the political situation towards instability” and “toppling the government illegally”.
Kommersant-Boscosport correspondent ALEXANDER ZILBERT lived the life of an Olympian in the Olympic village, inspected the house of the Russian national team, had lunch in the local canteen and even passed the WADA test after that.
I don't think life here freezes for a second.
Even at night.
The last starts sometimes end at midnight, after which the athletes need another hour and a half or two to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, the settlement and eviction from the village is carried out without a stop, as some athletes finish their performances and leave Brazil, and some, on the contrary, only arrive here.
And already at 7:30 in the morning in one of the temporary tents stretch the heads of all Olympic delegations.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational household issues, - says the head of the sports delegation of the Russian Olympic team Igor Kazikov. - Despite the fact that the house in which our, believe the model - it was commissioned one of the first and demonstrated to all the inspectors, even in it there are some shortcomings.
It's the hot water problem, I'm sorry, the toilets.
We fought for cleanliness for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the cleaners began to come, but only peed some substance on the floor, and that's all.
The floors are, you see, some kind of innovative.
You can’t wash them humanely.
Yes, we know these floors - the laminate is ordinary!
In general, we have achieved a change in the cleaning company and now everything is OK with this.
The Olympic village is a South Butovo, a sleeping area, fenced on one side by mountains, on the other - an impressive moat, sometimes filled with water.
Well, for reliability, there is still a two-meter iron fence around the perimeter, along which automatons walk.
In total, the village can accommodate up to 17,000 people in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
On one of the 18-storey buildings hangs a huge Russian flag - this house is completely given to the needs of our team.
Looking at a small foyer at the entrance, you can immediately determine what problems, apparently, are the most urgent for the domestic team.
At the reception there are two ads: printed "Please do not throw paper in the toilet!" and hand "I will accept as a gift badges.
The stand itself drowns in booklets.
Their cheerful color contrasts with the titles of brochures: "Memory of infectious diseases for travelers to Rio de Janeiro", "First aid for drowning, foreign body in the respiratory tract, loss of consciousness - the stages of cardiopulmonary resuscitation", "First aid for burns, burns, heat.
The text inside is generally encouraging.
For example: "Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent cure.
However, a favorable outcome is not waiting for everyone.
Of course, in the location of the Russian national team there is a medical center, which is ready to provide qualified assistance to the residents of the house at any time, including relaxing and sports massage.
Opposite the medical center is the headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door - an inspiring poster "No matter what, we will win!".
And, of course, the poems:
All arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who fear them will believe in them.
Let the less of us, the sweeter the taste of victory, Russia will not retreat, will not break!
And for an even greater lift of the spirit hangs the announcement: “Dear brothers and sisters!
With the blessing of His Holiness Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia, Archpriest Andrei Vladimirovich Alekseev takes spiritual care of the athletes of the Russian Olympic team.
You can order molieben and other requirements by phone...
In general, on the territory of the village there is a Center of meditations and religious rites for representatives of all faiths.
Well, the Russians, it turns out, are in a privileged position - they have their own chapel.
Due to the load of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth, I decided to go down the stairs, which is recommended to use during a fire.
And in the dark he stumbled over the bodies lying on it.
Apparently, they were sleeping employees of the new cleaning company.
I guess, ready at any moment to rush to wash the innovative floors, they decided to arrange a quiet hour directly on the cold stairs.
On the fourth floor, I was waiting for a meeting with a long-time friend - Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, the coach of our trampolines, who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his pupil, European champion Yana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show their rooms.
There is nothing to complain about, - shares the impressions of the well-deserved coach of Russia. - We live in twos, the beds, of course, are almost flat, but this is not critical.
The bathroom is one in four, but spacious.
Cabinet, of course, funny, made of fabric, trust does not cause, but things can be put.
"No, you're pretending, their tea is over!" - says tennis player Svetlana Kuznetsova, whom I met in the main dining room.
It is called the main one at least because it represents a space of 2.7 thousand square meters and is ready to receive 5 thousand visitors at the same time.
Here, they give out 60,000 servings a day for free.
The menu options are: "Best of Brazil", "Kitchen of the World", "Asian dishes" and "Pizza, pasta".
The latter option, as I peeked, is very popular with our volleyball players.
At the same time, for example, I did not find soups in any of the departments of a giant restaurant.
What kind of soup? - Kuznetsova wonders. - There is no tea!
It's a good thing I brought Chinese with me, custard.
And a kettle.
But in general, just so you know, we have even worse food on the courts.
Here at least something can be chosen, despite the unbearable monotony.
I personally chose cod for a couple and meatballs in tomato sauce.
Next to each dish there is a plate with its name in three languages - English, French and Portuguese, as well as indicating the nutritional value of the product and the presence of allergens in it.
Well, quite, I must admit, it was edible.
I don’t even know why this line is always in the local McDonald’s.
Our best friends, the representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), are waiting for the satisfied, relaxed, “warm” athletes at the exit of the restaurant.
Deceive cleverly - a quiz, the winner of which gets a T-shirt.
Provoke, you might say.
To get a gift, you need to correctly answer at least eight questions out of ten.
There are questions in Russian! – a girl from WADA attacked me.
But that's not who he attacked.
I mean, I'm in a patriotic rush, of course.
The situation worsened already on the second question: "If I received a notification about the passage of doping control, should I immediately go to the doping control point?"
I stopped at option B: “No – I have one hour.”
I have lost, so to speak, my vigilance.
I forgot that there is no need to wait for WADA.
In general, we need to appear immediately.
But in the seventh stage of the quiz, my position became quite critical.
I somehow thought that if I find it hard to follow a balanced diet because of my tight schedule (and I find it hard, by the way!) then I can use bio-additives to get “additional nutrients to boost my performance.”
Ann, no, they don't!
More precisely, the answer is formulated in such a way that it is categorically not forbidden, but strongly, in several sentences it is denied.
WADA is playing unfairly!
What's up, Russia? - mockingly asks the leading quiz.
There is nowhere to retreat - behind Efimov, Isinbayev and all our bleeding team.
So I focused and I won the unfortunate T-shirt.
You know what they say, ours!
In a triumphant mood, I stumbled into the fitness center next door.
I'm interested in counting the drills.
It went down to 250.
He noted with surprise that not a single Russian athlete was found in this pile of treadmills.
But maybe it's the right thing to do?
Let him train who can't play!
But in a nearby clinic, one of our guys was sitting.
In line for the ophthalmologist.
Don't worry, not the shooter.
In the clinic, however, as well as throughout the village, wherever you spit, there is a device for issuing condoms.
It has an inspiring message: “Celebrate with a condom!”
Then it remains only to twist the iron, reminiscent of the handle of the door lock, and a condom made of natural latex of the Amazon, readily falls out of the device.
I took one, as a souvenir.
The athletes will not give up - they brought 450 thousand of them.
Just for a festive and leisure time in the Olympic village there is a whole entertainment center.
Next to it, just in case, there is a cognitive sign reminding that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million per day on athletes in various ways.
The center is flooded with video games, billiards and tennis tables, table football and hockey and some strange devices similar to video simulators.
What is it? - I am interested in a friend in the form of the Ukrainian national team, who actively uses a strange toy.
You could, of course, just say that he does not want to talk to a person in the form of the Russian national team, and that’s all.
Here, by the way, for some strange coincidence in the eyes of the gurgling from the guys in yellow and blue.
The most played team, it turns out.
To get around the whole village, looking at each corner, it takes at least three hours.
But, if you walk, and not to ride electric cars, you will open and the house of the Canadian team with a moose at the entrance and a tent with a restorative bath, and a ticket office, and laundry, and dry cleaning, and a hairdresser, and a flower shop, and a shop with consumer goods, and a post office with a unique brand (only you all the same), and a bank and a post office with Chinese stamps.
And in the late evening you, exhausted, will sit next to an olive tree, hung with colored ribbons in memory of the friends and relatives of athletes who left this world.
And under the accompaniment of the machine, randomly spraying liquid to kill insects, you will think about the eternal.
It's about the Olympic movement.
Which in this village does not stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world held its breath watching as the Australians almost punished the American Dream Team, the real fans went to the network.
Few people know: the news that Inna Deriglazova won gold in rapier at the XXXI Olympic Games, I got first.
Maybe I’m even the only Muscovite who’s seen it happen – not counting those, of course, who watched the Carioca competition that night.
Only a true fan can understand this.
Imagine this: a deaf Moscow night.
The neighbors below - as always by the hour of the night - wake up and begin to calmly, but very loudly shout at each other.
And threatening to move furniture.
There is a faucet in the kitchen - there is no time to go to the market and buy, as asked by the plumber, a new one.
The TV schedule does not understand anything, so just kept control of the channels "Match", "First" and just in case "Russia" - although this is almost meaningless.
"Russia" - the homeland of repetitions, all the sport there for some reason in the record.
The series is broadcast live there.
Hope, of course, on the "Match" - the whole evening the young man shouted in the news releases first about the great semi-final of Deriglazov-Shanayev, then about the upcoming battle for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead, basketball is the U.S.--Australia.
I have nothing bad to say about this decision.
The Australians were on an equal footing, winning the first half.
They put Americans out of their own greatness in place.
As a result, we still lost, but, as they now say, the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer be the same.
It's all good, but the fight with DiFrancisco is coming, and on the screen without changes.
In a mild panic, I start flipping channels.
It feels like a second time in a row.
All right, let's go deep on the cable.
There is no swordplay on any of the thematic "Matches".
Oh, I feel like the fight's about to start.
Texting and tweeting some sports sites don’t suit me.
A convulsive surfing gives an unexpected, but brilliant result.
On the website of "First", it turns out, there is a live technical broadcast of all competitions that take place at this point in time.
I click on fencing, get a fight for gold.
Deriglazov perfectly counterattacks, goes forward on points - and quite obviously begins to pull the time.
The Italian woman plays almost the entire gap.
Ours is one point ahead, just over two seconds to the end.
DiFrancisca rushes to Deriglazov, she retreats, time runs out, the Italian woman injects.
Victory!
After a couple of seconds, the Olympic messenger on the phone announces the fourth gold medal.
I am the first to see it with my own eyes.
Insane, faithful, involved.
The Spiritual Directorate of Muslims (DUM) of Tatarstan refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the plenum of the Duma obliged its imams to conduct Friday sermons only in Tatar, in order to force young Tatars to “learn their native language”.
The agency said that this “in no way infringes” on the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques of Kazan complain that the Tatar language is not understood by up to 60% of the parishioners, including foreign students, migrants and the Tatars themselves.
The imams fear that their sermons in Tatar "will not reach the entire audience."
Yesterday, the plenum of the DUM of Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the republic only in the Tatar language.
According to the mufti of Tatarstan Kamil Samigullin, this should become an incentive for young Tatars to “learn their native language”.
“For those who say that it is “heavy”, in every large mosque we intend to organize lessons of the Tatar language absolutely free,” – said Mr. Samigulin.
He added that "the decision has already entered into force" and today in all mosques sermons "must already be in the Tatar language."
He recalled that the DUM of Tatarstan publishes the Shura magazine with typical sermons in the Tatar language.
The imam, who does not speak Tatar well enough, "can thoroughly prepare for them."
DUM of Tatarstan unites more than a thousand parishes in all municipalities of the republic.
According to the mufti, Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in the Tatar language in the districts.
At the same time, in Kazan, a number of mosques previously used predominantly Russian.
In particular, as the mufti pointed out, this was practiced in the Burnaev mosque, Zakabannaya and Eniler.
However, Mr. Mukhametshin stressed, the leadership sets a task for all students to master both state languages of the republic, regardless of nationality.
"There can be no question of any infringement of the non-Tatarian Muslims," Mr. Mukhametshin stressed, explaining that the sermon itself "is not a mandatory, basic part of the prayer."
At the same time, the prayer itself will still be read in Arabic, lectures and lessons in Russian will be preserved in mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Mukhametshin told Kommersant that there was no serious threat of expelling the Tatar language from mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar, other languages, for example, Uzbek or Tajik, according to him, are not used in sermons in the republic.
The decision of the Duma was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Congress of Tatars (WCT).
The head of the executive committee of the VKT, Rinat Zakirov, told Kommersant: “Mosques are an important part of our national life.”
It would be sad if the Tatar language left this sphere.
He noted that preaching only in the Tatar language "the desire of the imams themselves", but in the executive committee of the VKT "consider it correct."
Interviewed "Kommersant" imams, who preached in Russian, are ready to fulfill the decision of the Duma, but believe that the parishioners will have difficulties in understanding the clergy.
Tatars and Russians go to the mosque.
Many do not understand the language.
Of course, they will be bored.
"We will have to rebuild," says the imam of the Burnaev mosque Farhat Mavletdinov.
According to him, preaching in Russian is closer even to many Tatars, because "Russian in schools and kindergartens, on the radio - everywhere initially."
However, he believes that the mosque will be able to continue lessons and lectures in Russian, which are held on other days.
We rely on Allah.
Allah will show you the way out of this situation,” he concluded.
But about 60% of us do not know the Tatar language.
These are Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Azerbaijanis.
Many foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.
“That’s why we’ve been switching to Russian for four years,” says the imam.
He believes that in the Tatar language, sermons will “reach a narrower circle and will not reach the entire audience.”
But we will abide by the decision of the plenum.
The outcome of the preaching will be different.
But time will tell.
"For example, it will only be easier for me, because the Tatar language is my native language," Gabdulla Galiullin concluded.
The former director of the FSIN was put on trial
The Prosecutor’s Office of Moscow approved the indictment on the criminal case investigated by the GSU of the TFR on the embezzlement of budget funds allocated for the needs of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia.
The former head of the prison department Alexander Reimer and his deputy, who caused FSIN damage in the amount of more than 2.7 billion rubles, will be brought to court.
The Metropolitan Prosecutor’s Office sent a criminal case against the former Director of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia Alexander Reimer, his former Deputy Nikolai Krivolapov, as well as the Director of the Federal State Unitary Enterprise “Information and Technical Support Center and Communications of the Federal Service for the Execution of Sentences” (FSUE CITOS) Viktor Defenov to the Zamoskvoretsky District Court.
Depending on the role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are charged by the GSU of the ICR in Moscow under Part 3 of Article 285 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (abuse of official powers, entailing grave consequences), Part 4 of Article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (fraud committed using their official position, as part of an organized group, on an especially large scale).
In addition, Krivolapov is charged under Part 1 of Article 222 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the TFR, in 2010-2012, these persons fraudulently stole from the state treasury the budget funds allocated by the FSIN to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems for controlled persons, the so-called electronic bracelets.
To steal budget money, the group members developed a scheme according to which the company controlled by them, FSUE CITOS, with which the relevant state contracts were concluded, produced technical means of control and supervision, including "electronic bracelets", and sold at prices inflated several times.
Despite the fact that FSUE CITOS did not have production equipment, buildings, facilities for placing production facilities that allow creating a complete cycle of production of "electronic bracelets", five state contracts worth more than 3.3 billion rubles were concluded between it and the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia.
As a result of this scheme, the accounts of the Samara branch of the Federal State Unitary Enterprise turned out to be more than 2 billion rubles, of which 1.2 billion rubles were stolen.
According to the investigation, more than 140 million rubles. cash received personally Mr. Reimer in his office from one of the accomplices, the criminal case against which is allocated in separate proceedings.
Nikolai Krivolapov, who participated in the machinations, was found to have an unknown origin of cartridges for the award gun, which allowed him to bring an additional charge.
In this case, the volume of which amounted to 133 volumes, the FSIN filed a claim for compensation for material damage in the amount of 2.7 billion rubles.
Footballer Hakan Shukyur is suspected of involvement in the coup.
Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of the former football player and then member of parliament Hakan Shukur and conducted searches in two homes of his family.

Yegor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas only for domestic films.
“I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinema, tickets for which cost 2-3 times less than for foreign-made films,” he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky notes that it is difficult for Russian films to compete for the audience with large Hollywood films.
In our country, more than 100 paintings are made per year, of which an average of 20-25 tapes reach the screens.
“And even they are very difficult to compete with “Transformers” and “Iron Man”, in the promotion of which huge budgets are pumped”, – said the film director.
Recall that on July 1, the All-Russian Youth Educational Forum "Tavrida" began its work in the Crimea.
Among the participants are teachers of creative professions and young professionals of various creative and humanitarian fields from all over Russia and a number of countries near and far abroad.

In Miass (Chelyabinsk region) detained lawyer of the former vice-governor Nikolai Sandakov Konstantin Akulich.
As reported by "U-South Ural" another lawyer of the accused - Sergei Kolosovsky, Konstantin Akulich today called in the investigative department of the TFR Miass to bring charges in the case of a year ago about beatings.
Then Konstantin Akulich went to the scene of the accident as a lawyer to help one of its participants.
"Initially, it was initiated in relation to unidentified persons. Now, when he began to defend Nikolai Sandakov, it turned out that it was Akuli<0xC4><0x87>," says Sergei Kolosovsky.
Konstantin Akulich became a lawyer for the former deputy governor in early August.
At the same time, half an hour before the call of the lawyer in the TFR Miass, the defense was informed that on Monday the deadline for familiarization with the materials of the fraud case in which Nikolai Sandakov is accused expires.
We will remind, against Nikolai Sandakov opened two criminal cases.
As part of the first (fraud case), he is accused of a promise for 1.5 million rubles. to promote the appointment of the mayor of Magnitogorsk, head of the administration of Ozersk Evgeny Tarasov.
The second criminal case concerns a bribe that Nikolai Sandakov allegedly received from Igor Kalugin, the director of the Python private enterprise, in the form of illegal gratuitous provision of property services in the amount of at least 1.3 million rubles.
Read more about the case of Mr. Sandakov in the material "Kommersant" "The former vice-governor requires the unification of his affairs."
The Russian Copper Company (RMC) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that RMK undertook the modernization of one of the oldest and environmentally "dirty" enterprises in the country - the Karabakh Copper Smelting Plant.
The Karabakh Copper Smelting Plant was founded by an English joint stock company headed by Leslie Urquhart in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was a significant industrial enterprise for the country's economy, and it actually provided the life of the whole city.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production was stopped, which entailed serious social problems in Karabakh.
In 1998, it was decided to resume the work of the Karabash copper smelting plant.
It was also necessary to solve one of the main problems of the Karabash plant - the environmental one.
By the early 2000s, Karabakh was already infamously known as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the enterprise came under the management of the Russian Copper Company.
The company began to modernize its production, which gradually reduced the environmental burden on the environment.
This was recently noted by the Governor of the Chelyabinsk region Boris Dubrovsky, who visited Karabashmed in early July.
The head of the Southern Urals called the grand changes that have occurred with the enterprise since Karabashmed moved to the RMK group.
The main event for the modernization of Karabashmedi in recent years was the construction of a new sulfuric acid workshop, which allows catching up to 99.9% of metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian Copper Company Vsevolod Levin, the volume of investments in this project amounted to about 7 billion rubles.
The next stage of modernization of CJSC Karabashmed is the reconstruction of the converter division.
The replacement of three converters, dusters, gas pipeline is scheduled for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion rubles.
In addition, at the end of 2016, it is planned to launch a new industrial wastewater treatment plant worth 1 billion rubles.
In turn, the amount of taxes paid to the budget of the city of Karabash will also grow.
For the entire period of the Tominsky GOK project implementation - from the beginning of construction to the commissioning of the second stage - the federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion rubles.
And after the commissioning of GOK, the receipt of taxes in the budgets of all levels can amount to 80.9 billion rubles.
For the year of production in the Varna district, 346.3 million rubles were transferred to the budgets of different levels.
And that's for the first year.
"The longer the company operates successfully, the higher the amount of deductions may be," Valery Ulanovsky added.

The pensioner turned the ladder into a “budget beach tower”.
Users of the network laughed at the photos, in which an elderly man installed a ladder on the beach and turned it into a springboard for jumping into the water.
The photo was published on several entertainment portals, as well as in the group "My Taganrog" in the social network "VKontakte", which is why many decided that the photo was taken on the shore of the Sea of Azov.
In the comments, "innovation" was dubbed "budget tower" and "mobile springboard".
Many praised the man for his ingenuity and "skill", and some drew attention to the fact that the man is seriously at risk of getting injured when jumping from his tower, since he installed it at insufficient depth.
However, one of the commentators on the Pikabu portal noted that it is impossible to judge the depth of the sea from the photo.
“Firstly, we don’t know what the depth is, the beach can be a steep drop of a meter right behind the stairs, and secondly, even if there is a meter of depth, with proper skill you can jump from a couple of meters,” wrote the user under the name C0JIbAMDJZ.

WSJ: The United States is considering imposing sanctions against Russia because of the hacking of the servers of the Democrats.
U.S. officials are considering imposing new sanctions against Russia in response to the hacking of Democratic Party servers, The Wall Street Journal reports citing sources.
To impose sanctions, the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama will have to formally accuse Russia or Russian-backed hackers of attacking its servers.
According to sources, the FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies are almost certain of Russia’s involvement in the cyberattack.
The WSJ notes that usually the US prefers not to name those who carry out hacker attacks.
The exception is the 2014 hack of the Sony Entertainment Pictures database, for which responsibility was officially assigned to the DPRK.
Last year, however, Obama issued a decree simplifying the procedure for imposing sanctions on those who carry out or facilitate cyberattacks.
Initially, it was directed against China, but it can also be used against other countries.
The process of deciding on sanctions can be long, the publication writes.
Even if officials have concluded that the hackers acted with the support of Russia, they will have to weigh the possible consequences before deciding to disclose the information.
They will have to determine whether the incident is serious enough to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
Earlier it was reported that the administration of Barack Obama allows the possibility of sanctions against the state, the hackers of which hacked the servers of the national committee of the Democratic party.
WikiLeaks has published an e-mail from the Democratic National Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities may be involved in the hacking.
In the Kremlin, such reports were called absurd.
FAS fined Google almost half a billion rubles
The reason was the violation of competition in the market of mobile applications.
Antimonopoly proceedings were initiated at the initiative of Yandex.
The Russian company claimed that Google provides smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components on terms that prohibited the pre-installation of applications from other developers, in particular, from Yandex.
The FAS found confirmation of these claims and found that the company abused its dominant position in the market and imposed the installation of other applications together with the Google Play store to manufacturers of mobile devices.
As a result of the inspection, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google, said the deputy head of the FAS Alexei Dotsenko.
The fine must be paid within 60 days after the entry into force of the decision.
The FAS concluded that the law on the protection of competition must be observed by all companies, including transnational corporations.
In turn, Google intends to first study the decision and only then will be determined with further actions: to execute it or to challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service recognized the company as a violator of the competition law in September last year and ordered to adjust the contracts until December 18.
However, Google did not agree to this.
Since then, the company and the agency have been conducting court proceedings.
The FAS noted that, despite the fine, they are discussing with Google the possibility of concluding a settlement agreement.
This measure will not lead to anything.
This opinion was expressed by the leading analyst of the Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazin also noted that the fine will not affect either the users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

Snapchat’s “Anime” Effect Is Criticized as an Asian Cartoon
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by anime, but some commentators say that it is racially tactless.
Using the Lenses tool, Snapchat allows roughly 150 million users a day to change reality and play with individuality in ways that border on absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character to suit the picture of Roy Lichtenstein.
Lenses are rough, curved features tools that create more than 30 million corrected selfies a day.
Any mistakes quickly become common knowledge.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized in the past when they were accused of promoting dark facial skin or encouraging bleached faces as the ideal of beauty.
So when some users were offered a lens this week that gave them slanted eyes, crooked teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics saw it as a racist caricature of the “yellow-faced” Asians.
And they wondered if these recurring contradictions pointed to the company’s more serious problem of diversity.
Reports circulated on Wednesday, followed by outrage at reports on The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had removed the feature.
The company commented that the lens was intended as a tribute to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asians.
But experts who know about racism by ear, the lens reminded offensive stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the comparison with anime.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was actively shared, said the lens was “offensive and at least embarrassing.”
She added that "it's hard to argue with comparing side-by-side very rough cartoons on Asians and filter effects.
This shows that the filter is not just yellowish, but highly derogatory to yellowish.
Snapchat isn’t the only company passing through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be engaged in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry with us.
And Snapchat’s huge audience of young people — who are more racially diverse than their older generation — may mean they’re more likely to be expected to understand.
When one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an image that is offensive to the user, then, said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday, “this course of events is much harder to go unnoticed, as it was before.”
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that racial contradictions are the reason for the lack of diversity in recruitment in Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the predominantly white management of the company, consisting only of men, and ended her article with the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
Zhu, who is herself a Chinese-American, wrote: “Either they didn’t have enough non-white people in the state to make such decisions, or they have non-white people working, but they don’t hold positions where they can speak safely and openly.”
Other commentators share her point of view, expressing dissatisfaction with Snapchat's failure to answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information about the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial origin of its staff, but according to a trustee, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented segments of the population and on active attempts to involve domestic resources.
Zhu, for her part, said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, “I wonder if they really need more users like us so they can say it won’t work that way.”
The military leadership has distorted intelligence about ISIS, according to the congressional commission
Officials at the U.S. Central Command have altered intelligence reports to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than is warranted on the ground, a congressional committee said in a report released Thursday.
An interim report by the task force, set up by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Military Appropriations Subcommittee, found “widespread discontent” among Central Command intelligence analysts who claim that the leaders manipulated their assessments of U.S. actions toward Islamic victory.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is the main military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“Intelligence documents approved by the CENTCOM’s top brass tended to paint a more optimistic picture of U.S. counterterrorism than is supported by real data from the scene, and were consistently more optimistic than the analysis provided by other intelligence agencies,” the report said.
“What happened in Centcom is unacceptable: when the top leadership is presented with a false analysis, our military suffers,” said Rep. Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
Problems with management in the Centcom reach the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report details the flaws that constantly arose in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of US actions aimed at training the Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
While he does not provide definitive evidence that members of the Obama administration ordered the falsification of reports, he claims that analysts felt that the Centcom leadership was forcing them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements, and testimony from the Central Command in Congress were significantly more upbeat than actual events,” the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
“After months of investigation, this is for sure,” Rep. Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, top U.S. Central Command intelligence officials forged command intelligence documents to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans formed a task force when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that intelligence on the Islamic State was being falsified.
As the investigation progresses, the report released Thursday will be followed by more detailed data.
Additional, not completed at the moment, the investigation of the Centcom intelligence is carried out by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
Representatives of the Democratic Party in the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives of the U.S. Congress published on Thursday their own data, which is consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly closed process for intelligence assessments of ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, the Democratic Party’s top representative on the committee.
This procedure, according to Schiff, “suspended the release of intelligence documents,” damaged the morale of analysts, and “does not sufficiently reflect divergent views.”
But Schiff and the Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House tried to coerce Centcom analysts into adjusting their conclusions to “a given or political interpretation.”
Preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were presented on Tuesday by the portal The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of the investigation of the chief inspector of the Pentagon, opened after the complaints of analysts Centcom.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general’s investigation is ongoing.
But he said “experts sometimes disagree on how to interpret complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital national security issues.”
The consequences of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing in Iraq and Syria (as now claimed by more and more representatives of the Ministry of defense).
But last year’s statements cast doubt on whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide truthful assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis spots.
Criticism of intelligence on the Islamic State echoes a controversy that took place more than a decade ago, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article claiming that the administration of President George W. Bush had supported a small number of troops in Iraq because of the protests of many analysts and did not think about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest sparked by intelligence on the Islamic State.
Last year, officials said, Hooker’s team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes on Islamic State-owned oil refineries did not lead to a significant deterioration in the terrorist group’s financial situation because it built temporary oil refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the discovery was not widespread outside the Central Command, the Times reported in September.
The then-commander of the Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, came under fire last year after testimony in the Senate that many lawmakers found overly optimistic about the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced in the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. Wins 4 Consecutive Women's Field Hockey Championships, Approaching Decisive Battle With Britain
Once scoring three goals in a match that ended in a 6-1 win over Japan, Bam opened the scoring on Thursday with the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team, when the Americans defeated India 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bam, who is 27, says she is not sure if she would have ever done something like this.
“I have no idea,” she said.
I’m not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals.
Here's what she knows: the Americans' 4-0 score in the Olympic tournament, and they compete for first place in their group with Britain, which remains unbeaten after Japan's 2-0 loss on Thursday.
Teams from the United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams qualify for the quarterfinals, and the result of the game will determine who will take first place in their group of six teams, and who will take second.
The winner will avoid a meeting with a strong team of rivals from the Netherlands, the leaders of another group, a little time when the games of the quarterfinals begin.
However, Saturday’s game shows that the Americans here made noise with their unexpected series, four years after they took last place among the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, first taking a hockey stick on the grass when she was 3 (her older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she failed to qualify for the finals.
Then came 2012, when everything did not go well with her and her teammates.
The following year, Coage Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and things began to change.
“Cultural change, psychological change, change in physical fitness,” Bam said.
In London, we didn’t have the performance we have now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the score in the first half of the game with a throw from an uncomfortable hand at a short distance.
India came to the game without a single win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took the initiative in his own hands.
She made a long pass with the ball down the left side of the field, then spiraled into the middle and abruptly sent the ball into the goal, thereby giving the Americans an advantage of 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The dry win was the first in the tournament for U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who conceded one goal in each of the first three wins.
She's under attack.
So is Bam.
“We’re in a good position right now,” Parnham said, but how good it is depends on the outcome of Saturday’s game.
Amid the frenzy of the Olympic Games - "Zen" trampoline jumps
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it is the Olympics.
Events in Rio de Janeiro seem unchanging and inevitable, it is a frantic combination of competition and aspiration.
Like the Olympic flame itself is that burning torch that is passed from the archer to the swimmer, to the gymnast, to the triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbors talking in turn at a coffee shop and not hear about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clough.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a first-time Olympian handsome with dimples on his cheeks, could well be among those prime-time celebrities promoted by sponsors and life-affirming commercials if he were a swimmer, gymnast, or even a swordsman.
But 28-year-old Dooley from the city of Lake Forest in California is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline jumping competition.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all events in the same way.
Further from the center, partly in the shade, there are those sports that are not universally recognized: shooting from a pneumatic gun, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, his long reign.
But if I am allowed to speak timidly in defense of my personal addiction, allow me to draw your attention to the modest charm of trampoline jumping.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it debuted at the Sydney Games, over the past 16 years it has received so little recognition that many people I interviewed were unaware that they were an Olympic sport at all.
It could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, they never won a medal in trampoline jumping, and their athletes did not reach the final until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians usually share male awards, while the Chinese and Canadians share female awards.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie McLennan from Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But trampoline jumping has the charm of an outsider, in particular because for the unenlightened ear, it is more associated with a circus college than with the Olympic Games.
Here I must admit that I am not an expert, but only a down-to-earth enthusiast.
They do have comical potential – it’s the caricature of endless jumping – but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that they mostly combine.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word "el trampol<0xC3><0xAD>n", meaning "springboard for jumping into the water".
The contenders for the victory jump on a giant trampoline, taking off in the air by almost 30 feet, and must perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, bends and flips) until the final landing on their feet.
They are judged on performance, complexity, and "flight times" according to the official Olympic program.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is forward.
Candidates for the medal must go further, faster, higher and higher in pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish line, and sometimes back and forth, back and forth on the field.
They aspire not only to the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in the view of the television cameras, to another irritating milestone: the world or Olympic record.
This persistent aspiration is noble, admirable, even fanatical – and it is enough to make even the spectator weep.
In my opinion, it’s a bit exhausting to watch the games.
It gives him a respite from the trampoline jumps.
The direction of the trampoline is up.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she jumps, seems weightless, like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
And they certainly do not do without competition or difficulties, but throughout the program there is no crazy zeal for the finish, no long jumps, only a strange, graceful disappearance of time and gravity.
It is the closest to Zen Olympic sport.
Women's qualifying competitions, and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon, broadcast at one o'clock in the afternoon according to Eastern European time; men's - on Saturday, also in an hour.
NBC will air the final as part of its daytime program starting at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, a calm, beautiful moment is expected, which can easily be seen in a common dump.
And if the growth of consciousness can be achieved only by exposing male athletes to coveted views and objectification – as recently suggested by male gymnasts from the United States, according to the Wall Street Journal – Dooley is only waiting for his new admiring crowd of fans.
'Generation Protests' in Ethiopia, a longtime U.S. ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced fierce opposition from the government.
Witnesses said dozens of protesters were fatally wounded during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of a split?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable countries, a staunch ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shaken the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
In the past week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding radical political change.
According to human rights defenders, the government’s response was brutal.
Witnesses said police officers shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video footage from the protest scene, allegedly filmed late last year or earlier this year, shows security officers beating young people with sticks when they were handcuffed to a wall.
A senior United Nations human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country from disintegrating, and it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project at the International Crisis Research Group.
Ethiopia is Africa’s second most populous country after Nigeria, and its stability is maintained by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to counter terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy is growing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly – there is even a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And its streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy - human rights organizations constantly mention government repression - the opposition on the territory of the state was suppressed, due to the fact that the dissidents were actually silenced.
Many of them were exiled, imprisoned, killed or exiled to remote deserts.
But that could change.
“If people are constantly suppressed and left with no other option but to protest, there will be an uprising,” said Seyum Teshome, a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
All the young people are protesting.
Generations are protesting.
There have been numerous complaints, ranging from land use to the government coalition’s seizure of power.
After a widely criticised election last year, the government party and its allies have completely ousted the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are rising; the struggle for this uncertain, contentious border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the unrest and rearm.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, simmering in the depths of the soul for several years, flare up now.
The first, it would seem, is completely harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social networks, as cheap smartphones have become commonplace and internet service has become better.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people still find it possible to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this is how they organized for the protests.
The second is that there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
For centuries, Amharas from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia have flourished in politics and business, exploiting the Oromo, many of whom are Muslims and live in low-lying areas.
But that's also changing.
“We will act together under a single principle,” said Mulatu Gemechu, Oromo’s leader.
The largest protests took place in Amhara and Oromo.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which makes up about 6 per cent of the population and which controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Ethiopia’s prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an unknown illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could foresee danger.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at recognizing the first signs of discontent and using scouts to gather data and neutralize opponents.
“The current regime lacks common sense,” said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desaleni, appeared out of nowhere and took the place of Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was originally from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is a Southerner.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the Tigray-controlled security services.
Many fear that this will result in more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts said appeared to be elections that the government foiled and then falsified the results.
In the ensuing repressions, many Protestants were killed, albeit in smaller numbers than in recent months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
The development experts expressed their appreciation to the leaders of Ethiopia for the forward-looking development of the infrastructure, such as the new long-distance train, and for the significant progress made in the fight against poverty.
But it is clear that this has not stopped the rise of domestic discontent with the Ethiopian government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, a city in Amhara, attacked Tigray-owned businesses, and anti-Tiger hatred on social media is becoming pervasive.
Analysts say the protesters are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it has closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose strength in an already unstable region.
“And it will be difficult to get through this tight rope,” Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his claim that ISIS was founded by Obama, “sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump tried to cover up the latest conflict that engulfed his campaign on Friday, claiming he was joking when he claimed several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s ability to address the American people intelligibly.
It also put his deputies, who tried to protect him during the period of unrest, in an awkward position, as they had to explain statements that he probably did not mean.
Expressing this assumption at a convention on Wednesday night, Trump strongly insisted on his assertion on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the president and Clinton had founded ISIS.
But in a Twitter post early Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just being vile.
The post was the exact opposite of the claim made just a day earlier, when Trump said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften the statement by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate failed to seize the opportunity.
The latest scandal erupted as Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy amid a downgrade.
Trump and Clinton made competing speeches about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump again tried to return to this topic.
Again, using Twitter, he warned that Clinton’s plans would lead to tax increases, and said he found her speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm as an excuse.
In late July, after he drew widespread criticism for practically suggesting that the Russians should hack into Clinton’s email, he later explained his remarks by saying, “Of course I’m joking.”
This approach allows Trump to go beyond what is permissible in political speech and take his words back if necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing out messages that resonate with his fans, watching how they act, and then ‘explaining’ them one way or the other, depending on the reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he’s cautious in his statements and knows they’re vague enough to interpret them differently.
Instead of softening statements for the broad electorate, Trump has taken an even more hawkish tone in recent days, while his approval ratings continue to fall.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist rating, released Friday, showed Trump trailing Clinton by a large margin in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and going with her level in Florida.
While Trump tends to try not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump has come under increasing scrutiny in recent months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have put his loyal allies in an awkward position: they have to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York who is one of Trump’s most prominent deputies, made a serious effort to protect the candidate in an interview given to CNN on Thursday.
“I think what he’s saying is an acceptable political commentary,” Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, tiny organization, he called it non-threatening, absolutely unfair, and that’s why it happened, because he withdrew troops from Iraq.
Most of the average Republicans claim that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to develop, as it failed to harden the situation in the Middle East.
Before the rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter for blurring his every word and bias against him.
He mocked the “poor poor” TV experts who were trying to figure him out, and said, “They’re weak!”
Some Democrats have derided Trump’s excuses as further confirmation that he is unfit to be president.
A once-displaced coffeehouse returns to Greenpoint
Willow Coffeehouse was a shabby, cash-only place in Williamsburg that didn’t have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, she was forced out of her room with a showcase on Bedford Avenue.
Shop "Soup Sherry", which took the place of "Verb" in the summer of 2014, is engaged in the sale of soap in the form of cupcakes.
The locals mourned it as the last loss in the renovating city.
Artist Molly Krabaple tweeted: “New York City is constantly changing, I know, but I still can’t believe CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and Verb is now a soap store.”
But while New York is constantly changing, it is, in turn, being updated.
The revived Werb Coffee Shop opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verbe has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but there are some of the same staff and a similar simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
At the head of the new “Verba” is Sisko Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old coffee shop, who is the owner and general manager of the new place.
He started working at Verbe in 2001 and was there until the very end.
When one of the clients offered to sponsor him in a new place, he said that he would gladly go for it.
Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, 36, left much to be desired.
Verb works with the same bagel distributor and bought the same model of coffee machine.
It even has chandeliers from the old "Verba".
But Rodriguez said he would also like to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
The menu includes sandwiches with bacon, egg and cheese, and there are toppings of capers or fried onions.
There are dishes of brown rice.
The coffee shop no longer serves beer, but now they prepare freshly squeezed juices.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
“A lot of former customers have also been squeezed out of Williamsburg by prices,” he said.
On one of the recent Sundays, Rebecca Oliveira was one such client.
Oliveira, 34, had previously lived in Williamsberg and frequented The Willows.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still went there.
After the closure of Verba, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I realized that it was the coffee and the atmosphere that impressed me at Verba,” she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, although that day instead of the usual ice coffee she ordered blended tea, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime client, has been faithfully visiting Werb since 2003.
He came in before work and always ordered the same thing.
“At fifteen minutes past eight, every day, like clockwork, I would come in and my bagel would be made with butter and all the stuffing,” he said.
Rodriguez said that he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes the usual order, but someday he will change something with the help of bacon, egg or cheese on a bagel with all the fillings.
Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez said that he was not offended by the fact that the soap shop once took possession of the old place.
Moreover, the owners of Soup Sherry offered to make a special soap for Verba, using coffee from a coffee shop, prepared in a cold way, as an ingredient.
“I think we might agree to their offer,” Rodriguez said.
Residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin also chose this coffee house.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to find a place for him in the showcase so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has other benefits.
A local juice point plans to bottle and sell cold-brewed coffee.
There is a possibility that the coffee house will join the neighboring building.
For many customers, it is enough that the new "Verb" will include their favorite dishes in the menu.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and shared that he was heartbroken when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened in a new location, Whitt said that when he went inside and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt as if he had returned home.
“How long have I wanted to smell it,” he said.
The Depressive Food of Depression at the “Defense Meal”
In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office.
As a foodie, President Roosevelt loved Fifth Avenue’s trendy dishes, such as foie gras and Maryland turtle soup.
His menu on this day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and for dessert - prune pudding.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who suffered,” said Jane Siegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
Spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are specialists in the history of food.
Cowe’s latest book, The Chinese Step, was dedicated to Chinese cuisine in America, and Siegelman told the story of living in a rented apartment on the Lower East Side through food in her book, House 97 on Fruit Garden Street.
Their new joint work, “The Plot Meal,” which will be published Tuesday by Harper’s is the story of American food in the Great Depression.
In a measure of their own culinary solidarity, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop, a tiny, unpretentious diner in the Flatiron Quarter that has been operating since 1929, the year of the stock market crash.
Siegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with pieces of olives, and Coe, 57, took a turkey, mashed potatoes and a vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered a meat roll, the couple considered it a suitable starting point for discussing food in the Depression era.
“Roulettes were in great demand,” Siegelman said.
There was peanut roll, liver roll, bean roll.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to stretch.
Imagine that you ate as much peanuts as you need for dinner.
Coe frowned.
"He must have been lying in his stomach with a stone," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in the countryside, was a buffet.
Groups of women cooked for male farm workers, and a freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. The "dense meal" describes how the country coped with what suddenly ceased to be a country of abundance.
“It was a time when food became a central, challenging topic for Americans,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Just as difficult was the new budget diet: enigmatic dishes such as rolls and casseroles became staple foods; casseroles were “a great way to recycle scraps,” Siegelman noted, “because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruits have been replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which for many years was the basis of American food, has become an economically distributed luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
While doing research for a book that includes recipes, Siegelman prepared a dish of the era: a baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.
“This addition to the dining table was not a success,” Coe said.
Ziegelman added: “It was very strange.”
Peanut butter is not at all suitable for baked onions.
This was typical for many household recipes.
More than ever before, and never since, householders—including Louisa Stanley, the head of the Federal Household Bureau from 1923 to 1943—managed the country’s eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become “budgetaries”, to take the challenge and transform burgundy like grated spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
The “dish” is a feast of curious historical facts.
Especially spicy stories about the government's reaction to starving citizens, for example, the position of President Herbert Hoover in the spirit of "let them eat pies."
Publicly extolling a simple Iowa farmer’s dish from his childhood, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he had become.
“He liked continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce,” Coe said.
He ate almost in a gilded dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantastically detached from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not advised him to set an example with his own stomach.
Eleanor Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in taste at all, and this led to the fact that the White House "used not only the most dreary food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgustingly cooked."
Many of the culinary techniques of the Depression era were forgotten as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, says Siegelman, and on how science has been used in cooking.
The couple say that while writing the book, they had a better understanding of Siegelman’s mother’s eating habits — that she couldn’t throw away food, for example.
“She had a serious fear of being negligent about food,” Coe said.
Ziegelman recalls, "She poisoned people in all seriousness."
There was one unfortunate incident with the profiteers.
When the plates at Eisenberg's were empty, she and Coe got a dessert they made at home: a prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
“It’s called prune mousse,” Siegelman said, adding that it was a common practice to give modest recipes catchy names.
There were no whipped cream, only prunes, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly immersed the spoon in a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it was not bad.
Coe asked twice for supplements.
With the voice of a confident budget maker, he told his wife, “A few chopped walnuts would be nice.”
The arrest of defendants in the case of a mass brawl in the Khovansky cemetery has been extended until November 14
The Presnensky court left the defendants in the case of a mass brawl in the Khovansky cemetery under arrest until November 14, satisfying the relevant request of the investigation.
There are 14 defendants in the case.
Recall that on May 14 at the Khovansky cemetery there was a mass brawl of several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus with the use of weapons, which killed three people.
The former head of the cemetery Yuri Chabuev and lawyer, co-founder of the public organization "Healthy Nation" Alexander Bocharnikov were charged with organizing the murder.
The issue of the second indexation of pensions for 2016 can be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was reported on August 12 by Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets during a visit to the Bryansk region.
We have laid down specific parameters for how much it is necessary to increase the pension in order to offset the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations are done.
Now economists are summing up the results of the half-year, and we will complete this work within the next two to three weeks," Golodets told Interfax.
Commenting on the scheme proposed by the head of the Center for Strategic Developments Alexei Kudrin to raise the retirement age for six months every year, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the Cabinet does not consider this topic.
At the end of July, it became known that the Government agreed on the position on the full indexation of pension payments in 2017.

Turkish opposition leader Fethullah G<0xC3><0xBC>len has called for an international investigation into the circumstances of the coup attempt in Turkey.
"I demand that an independent international commission investigate the coup attempt," French newspaper Le Monde quoted G<0xC3><0xBC>len as saying.
The Turkish opposition leader also said that "if any part of the accusations are confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, G<0xC3><0xBC>len strongly denies involvement in the coup, stressing that his organization has never claimed political power.
An Istanbul court earlier in absentia arrested opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah G<0xC3><0xBC>len.
The coup attempt took place in Turkey on the night of July 15-16.
Gilead to reimburse attorneys during hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to recover attorney fees it incurred in a lawsuit over a patent for a hepatitis C drug with drugmaker Merck & Co Inc., a federal district judge ruled.
In June, Gilead was exempted from paying $200 million in damages for violating two Merck patents related to Gilead’s drugs, sales leaders Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a series of violations by Merck, including lying under oath and other unethical acts.
In a court filing on Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to recover the costs incurred in challenging the lawsuit.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to the laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s drugs.
US-backed armed forces claim to have seized full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
The U.S.-backed armed forces have seized full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters left the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now cleaning up the city after the departure of the remaining group of militants who were hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the Manbij military council allied with the SDF told Reuters.
“The city is now completely under our control, but we are undertaking clean-up operations,” he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a 34.2 percent federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in speaking fees, and the former secretary of state announced a $3 million income from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her tenure in the State Department.
The potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane from Virginia, along with his wife Anna Holton published tax returns for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set the standard for financial transparency,” Clinton campaign adviser Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump hides behind fake excuses and breaks his past promises to make his tax returns public.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers cited an audit by the State Tax Service as the reason for his refusal to disclose his tax returns.
“Your move,” Clinton campaign adviser Ian Sams tweeted, referring to the Democratic candidate’s declaration.
On Thursday, Trump’s special adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until after the inspections.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, said his refusal raises questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton seized on the issue and on Friday released an online video that focused on prominent Republicans who had persuaded Trump to release tax returns.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what every single presidential candidate has done for decades: make his tax returns public,” she told the crowd.
The Politico newspaper reported that Trump paid no or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted many tax attorneys and accountants as saying that it may still be the case.
Federal tax rates have been the subject of controversy in the presidential election.
Clinton supported the rule, named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people receiving more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, invited Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also under IRS scrutiny and that Trump was “afraid” not of the tax-gathering agency, but of voters.
Clinton’s campaign released tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The 2015 Clinton Declaration showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income came from wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, and the Clintons announced dividends and a return on capital of $109,000.

Chili powder condoms and fireworks boost protection for Tanzanian elephants
Environmentalists in Tanzania use an unconventional way to prevent elephants from straying into human settlements by throwing them condoms filled with chili powder.
The method proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, along with the U.S. Nature Conservation Committee, took over its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-step method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
“Since we invented the toolkit ... we’ve seen a change in attitudes within these communities, as a result of which they are much more confident that they will be able to keep elephants out of their fields without harming elephants,” said Damian Bell, Honeyguide’s executive director.
The first two steps are to light the torch in front of the elephant that has broken the border and to give signals with the help of the horn.
If he could not be scared away, then the so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with soil is placed with a cotton ball in a condom, and its end is twisted, only a wick remains outside.
When lit, the condom bursts with a rumble, spraying small dust of chili powder in the air.
One blow is usually enough to turn the elephant in the other direction.
The extreme measure is a launcher that fires Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
So far, 32 Turkish diplomats who left the country after the attempted coup in July have not returned to Turkey.
Such data was provided by the Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in an interview with local journalists.
At the first stage, we recalled 208 personnel diplomats to continue their work at the center.
Of these, 32 people did not return without objective reasons and explanations," the Turkish foreign minister said.
Recall that in July in Turkey there was an attempt at a coup d'etat.
The authorities of the country officially announced that the coup failed, and also reported the detention of more than six thousand people, among them military officers of the highest and middle levels.
As a result of the coup attempt, 290 people were killed, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry.
Jewish director sharply criticized the Berlin hotel for removing Israel's phone code at the "request" of the Arabs, told the channel RT News
A French director of Jewish origin has unleashed a scandal in the media, finding that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have Israel’s phone code on the list, with employees citing “requests” from Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah Holocaust documentary, expressed his displeasure at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the hotel, Lanzman tried to find Israel in the phone codes list provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the states where you can call directly from the room.
How could it happen that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was excluded and eradicated?
Written by Lanzman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to dial Israel through its own telephone service center.
In search of an explanation, the director raised this question at the reception of the hotel administration.
The response he received there, Lanzman said, “shocked him.”
The hotel's clerk said the measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotel chain."
The reason behind this step caused even more anger of the director.
“Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that the Israeli code be removed,” said Lanzman, a hotel official.
Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case a “terrible disgrace,” according to the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.
We were shocked and appalled by the incident.
This is actually a terrible shame.
The fact that it happened in Germany and in this very hotel chain is an even greater shame.
No explanation is needed here.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” the official said.
The incident caused a lot of controversy on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski Hotel was simply "going about it" with the supposed demands of Arab customers.
“We would be ashamed,” another post said, pointing out that the hotel, located on the glorious Kurfurstendamm street, was next to a synagogue.
The hotel itself hastened to dismiss any accusations, calling the incident a “misconduct” and “apologizing” to Lanzman, the newspaper Der Spiegel reports.
“There was no direct order not to include Israel in the quick-recruitment list,” the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper quoted Kempinski as saying.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students protesting
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest government reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The riots began when police officers tried to disperse the students, causing the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, almost 100 public secondary schools will be closed, and 300,000 students will be redistributed to save money.
Some protesters could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against acting President Michael Temer.
The latest protest came just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support ousted President Dilma Rousseff when the country’s Senate voted to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71%, RT Business reports
With the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Jagaryan.
As international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there is a growing interest on the part of Russian firms to do business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are renewing ties with Iran, and new firms are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Jagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran grew by 91.5 percent and amounted to 697 million dollars.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
Jagaryan also predicts that a record number of Iranian tourists will visit Russia this year.
Last year, Russia’s diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly tourist ones, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran entered the top 20 countries by the number of tourists visiting Russia.
It is safe to say that last year’s record for the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which, the ambassador hopes, will change.
“I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition,” he said.
The state continues to tighten the screws in the military-industrial complex.
The reason for the dismissal was the “systematic failure” of the orders of the general director of the concern “Almaz-Antey”, “misses in work” and “loss of confidence”.
Gennady Bendersky was appointed the head of the NGO for the next three years.
Information about the dismissal of Neskorodov appeared only on Thursday evening and did not cause a wide resonance in the media.
How to explain such silence in the conditions of large-scale rearmament of the army?
Most likely, the leadership of the Russian Federation does not want to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in the public sphere.
This once again confirms that the military-industrial complex (MIC) has many problems and the state does not want to attract increased attention from society.
The removal of Neskorodov is undoubtedly an important event in terms of restoring order in the industry.
NPO "Almaz" - the main enterprise of the concern, which specializes in the production of anti-aircraft missile systems (SAMS) sea and land-based.
Currently, Almaz is working on the creation of the Poliment-Redut and Morpheus air defense systems, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the portal Military Russia Dmitry Kornev believes that the dismissal of Neskorodov caused by the failure of deadlines for these projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of "Morpheus" began in 2007, and the commissioning was expected in 2013.
"Poliment-Redut" should become the main air defense system on the newest ships of the Navy.
According to the information I receive, not a single truly successful test has been performed in several years of testing.
However, as far as I can judge, this is not the unequivocal fault of “Diamond”, – said Kornev.
The expert fears that a delay in commissioning may occur with the S-500 SAM.
The development work on the project has not yet been completed, but during 2016 the first complexes should enter the troops.
The Ministry of Defense assures that "the work is being planned and everything will be completed within the prescribed time", although in 2014 the agency recognized the problems with the development of the S-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Neskorodov, who has led Diamond since 2011.
Kornev noted that delays in deadlines for projects can be both a reason and a reason for dismissal.
In his opinion, in recent years it has become extremely difficult to obtain information about internal processes in the defense industry and plans of the management of enterprises.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and big money is known to love silence.
As a rule, directors of defense companies leave their positions at will, under a contract of agreement of the parties or are transferred to another job.
In this case, the suspension occurred in public, although it did not receive a resonance.
This suggests that the head of the "Diamond" was, perhaps, a stubborn figure and resisted the "discharges" coming down from above.
Apparently, the state no longer intends to tolerate such behavior.
By the hands of shareholders, it will remove those who prefer to argue with the installations of the Ministry of Defense and do not fulfill the tasks set.
At the same time, the leadership of the Russian Federation seeks to punish the crooked managers (machinations on the Zvezda shipyard).
Increased attention to the problems of the sector is paid personally by the President.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military-Industrial Commission and periodically holds meetings on rearmament.
The Kremlin protects the ranks of the defense industry managers, seeking to have at hand a loyal staff of directors who will carry out orders received from above.
This is a far from ideal policy, but against the background of rampant corruption and the lack of normal competition in the defense industry, the state has no other tools.
The current situation in the defense industry, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation stimulates the Kremlin to clean up the Armed Forces as soon as possible.
In parallel with the "cleansing" of managers in the defense industry, the leadership of the Russian Federation is taking quite successful steps to improve the professionalism of Russian troops.
The personnel of the army acquired a new quality with the advent of the Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu.
It seems that the President has adopted the famous saying "If you want peace, prepare for war."
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union’s military might and nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which cemented Moscow’s sphere of influence on the continent.
Despite all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked quite effectively.
Proof of this was the absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
The triumph of the “winners” in the Cold War eventually resulted in the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States in the “civilized world”, perhaps not a single quiet corner is left.
Despite the common misfortune, the West refuses to talk to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
In such conditions, the only allies of our country are the navy and the army.
The strengthening of military power will allow Moscow to more effectively defend national interests and reach new frontiers of world politics.
Scottishman Callum Skinner is racing in the finish line, causing the British to capture the bicycle gold
Scotland’s Callum Skinner raced to triumph in a men’s team sprint at the Rio Velodrome last night, prompting the UK team trio to defend their title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old native of Glasgow was in the role of the strongest, which his Scottish friend Sir Chris Hoy made his own, and the young man proudly went down in history, running along the finish line to snatch a victory from the favorite team from New Zealand.
Britain claimed the rights to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning when Hoi claimed the rights to a fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing modestly sixth at the March Track Cycling World Championships in London, despite the fact that Hoi has since ended his career.
The issue between Beijing and London was the replacement of specialist participant Jamie Staff.
They did so just at the time when Hinds appeared.
Hoya's departure also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man who was followed by British coaches, seeing potential in the Scotsman that was now being realized.
Hindez, Kenny – champions with Hoi four years ago – and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the standard was surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindez was right behind his circle, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported.
A change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, where Hindez drove on a larger gear to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched from his seat as a guest BBC expert and caught the gaze of Skinner, Kenny and Hinds as they stepped onto the pedestal.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: “This is a flattering comparison.”
I'm here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
That was incredible.
There is no better way to win.
After a triumph in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindez admitted to intentionally crashing the track after a failed start.
He later declined to comment, and there was no way to appeal from UK rivals.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindez said: “I felt like I was in London, with all those British flags on the podium.”
We have all met as a team in the last three months.
We lost so many world-famous races that it was amazing to win the Olympics again.
It is one event, one gold medal for a country that has won seven of the 10 race titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months, then the velodrome is waiting for five more successful days.
With the form demonstrated by Kenny, it’s not beyond the realm of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy’s feat by winning three Olympic gold medals in the same Games.
This would allow us to see how Kenny – who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoya, who was also born on March 23 (this seems to be a sacred date in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) – brings his score to six gold medals and one silver.
It would be the same as Hoya's.
The next time Kenny competes in a sprint that starts today and runs for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: “I’m just enjoying it now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You come here to win with your comrades.
It's a little lonely to win alone, to be honest.
Hindez said, “If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted.”
It was the only medal draw of the day, but there was further good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke and Owen Dull are the fastest four-kilometer team pursuit race of all time.
They finished in 3:51,943.
The world record set when winning gold in London in 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will take place today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be in the spotlight.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the qualifying race, when officials asked him to measure his weight.
In the corresponding women’s event, which resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rosell Shand, Eleanor Barker, and Kathy Archibald of Milngavey improved the world record by showing a time of 4:13.260.
Team Great Britain has come to rely on a powerful team of cyclists to take ownership of the middle period of the Olympic Games and earn a bunch of medals.
After in fact exceptional demonstrations of complete superiority in Beijing and London, expectations have weakened in the gradual preparation for Rio.
There were dramas in the background, not least the resignation of tech director Shane Sutton in April over allegations of sexism and harassment, and the departures of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, based on the first night’s race at the Velodrome, it seems that Britain’s now legendary glory in reaching the tops at the right time may just happen again.
The future of Portland’s steel plant is under threat due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland-based aluminum plant in Victoria — as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers — is under threat because the power company that supplies the plant, according to one of the plant owners, is about to terminate the supply contract: it is planned that all supply contracts will be terminated.
The move follows a decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian government not to extend subsidies to support the plant’s operations.
The fixed subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at Alcoa’s Portland plant.
As many as 2,000 jobs – directly and indirectly – could be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect consequences, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 percent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed a steel plant in Point Henry, which led to the closure of a power plant in Anglesey last year.
Alcoa’s Portland steel plant is losing money and risking closure.
These actions were the result of thinking about the future of the plant, which has been going on for several years, initially due to the strong positions of the Australian dollar, and later - because of the price of the plant's products.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners to also take steps to terminate the contract.
The controlling share of the plant belongs to the joint short-term enterprise of Alcoa and Alumina, while the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
“AGL expects the Portland facility to continue operating, that is, the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not stop,” she said.
According to AGL, these contracts are the so-called “hedged contracts”, which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will actually end in 2017.
“Accordingly, AGL still expects these contracts to bring their share of revenue in fiscal year 2017,” the company said in a statement.
Any potential impact on AGL’s earnings since fiscal year 2018 is currently limited by forecasts for a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its report by $187 million in the form of an “imminent termination.”
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts “does not affect Alcoa’s ability to operate a steel plant or to supply electricity to a steel plant.”
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to take effect in November, but it has yet to explain why it terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland metallurgical plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the unfavourable economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, AGL’s Chief Operating Officer Steven Mikkelsen said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy annually, while Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
For us, as a producer, it will be bad,” he said.
Not only the star of the reality show Kardashian, Kendall on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, mother-manager Chris, appeared on the coveted September cover of American Vogue magazine.
Kendall, who is the face of the Estee Lauder brand and paraded at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“While in the room with my loved ones, I looked at this cover and cried,” Kendall wrote.
The news about the cover was accompanied by a strange (or just in the spirit of the “Kardashian Family”?), prepared by a reality video in which the whole Kardashian-Jenner family (deboshirs Rob and Caitlin, also joined by the universal favorite uncle of show business, producer of the “Kardashian Family” they put on the end of the Sekrest), and the end of the show.
This is the standard storyline of almost all episodes of children's television shows dedicated to the birthday (Sichrest utters the phrase: "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit from the program at 8 a.m.), but Chris needed to get this glory in one way or another to other girls.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we have undoubtedly entered a new era of the Kardashian show.
Even though Kendall Kim’s older sister got on the cover of Vogue earlier (she appeared on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is Vogue’s best-selling issue of the year.
Thicker similar to a gift edition than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to the calculations of the portal Fashionista, 615 pages from last year's 832-page issue contained advertising).
The news about which stars will be on his cover is expected with such anticipation that in the last two years, the magazine’s photos have merged before the official announcement.
Previous women featured on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has certainly featured more “celebrities who work as models” than “models who are celebrities.”
Oscar winner and Dior brand face Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga took the honor.
But even in the unlikely event that Jenner, described by the magazine as the “outstanding model” of her generation, falls into the first category, she’s in good company.
These celebrities aren’t famous people’s relatives, reality TV stars, or modern kids who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner falls into all of these categories).
These are really talented women who thrive in the entertainment industry.
For Beyonce, who appeared on last year's cover, this year was one of the most successful in her career in connection with the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Jenner’s position in the fashion world, due to her past as a reality TV star, always had to remain shaky.
In June, one of the first Victoria's Secret models, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "bitches of the moment."
These sentiments were again stirred after the news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But to dwell on discontent makes no sense.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She's a marcher for Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you Estee Lauder's tonal cream.
She, and all her sisters, sell you their photos in their own apps, available on a paid subscription.
She sells hand-made photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter to Love magazine.
And in her spare time, perhaps to still see her sister Courtney and her children, she participates in a reality TV show.
Public law centers refuse to serve 160,000 people a year
Every year, more than 160,000 vulnerable people are denied access to public legal centres as the sector prepares for the impact of further cuts in funding on already-limited activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people—mostly elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, people unable to fight unfair deprivation of property, and so on—have already been turned down in an attempt to obtain free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services, already operating beyond capacity, are preparing for further cuts.
From June next year, these legal centers should lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Public Law Centres, said that according to the latest census by the National Association of Public Law Centres, thousands of people are rejected each year.
Farrell said that if the federal government’s decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
“Queensland’s public law centres are consistently underfunded: this means thousands of people are being denied vital services they need,” he said.
People leaving abusive relationships, people with unmanageable and crippling debts, families going through divorce, unfairly fired workers — all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, which means thousands of less-protected Queenslanders will be forced to address complex legal issues without help.
We call on Justice Minister and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts so people can get the help they need when they face legal challenges.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funding for free legal aid to the national average.
Now it is time to pay attention to the needs of public legal centers and communities, their clients, and it is time for the government of Palashchuk to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump’s campaign has been sued after an employee allegedly threatened with a gun.
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump’s campaign was sued: allegedly, the headquarters did nothing after the report that his operating director in North Carolina threatened an employee with a gun when they were driving in a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state's campaign headquarters.
Bordini said he had waited several months for the issue to be resolved internally, but realized that “this is not going to happen.”
Director Earl Phillip "pulled out his gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pointed his muzzle at Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the complaint.
Complaining to the local and regional office of the election headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four more people were involved in similar incidents with Phillip, according to the appeal.
“Pistols don’t have to shoot to cause damage,” Bordini said in the complaint.
The lawsuit came just two days after a Republican presidential candidate made a furor by telling listeners in North Carolina that the “Second Amendment people” — understood as gun owners and their admirers — could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and can elect judges.
Trump’s campaign said the media took his words out of context and that he did not speak out in support of the violence.
In his complaint, Bordini demands compensation from the election headquarters for negligent control, and from Phillip for the threat of physical violence, insult by action and causing moral harm.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks is slow to respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to talk to Phillip were unsuccessful.
The WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, said Phillip had recently left the campaign headquarters.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, no one quickly called back.
The presidential candidate from the Republican party Donald trump conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, High Court Division for the District of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain should direct the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring revival and prosperity not only in our localities and in London in general, but across the country.
For me, it was exactly that huge advantage of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to ensure that our nationalities and regions benefit from the Games.
The Olympic Games brought huge benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do it again, creating opportunities for locals and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as it was before London 2012, there will be those who think that the task of expanding Heathrow is too large.
I have been told that Britain will never be ready for the Olympic Games and that we will find ourselves in a difficult position on the world stage.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012 and will prove them wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked about him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just the narrow circle.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has implemented an <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment programme on time and on budget, from T5, the airport’s best terminal for five years running, to T2, built in the middle of the world’s two busiest runways.
Now they are ready to provide a third runway, confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The London 2012 Olympics were a huge success for the UK, and I’m sure Heathrow’s expansion will be, too.
It is time for us to steer the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton – Chairman of the Council of Heathrow and former Trade Attaché of the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook play “cat-mouse” on the issue of blocking advertising
For companies that make money from online advertising, trying to bypass ad-blocking software is a cat-and-mouse game, according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, just a couple of days after Facebook announced it was going to block ad blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users can update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site will change the layout around its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to recognize which parts of the page are ads.
But Adblock now claims it was able to bypass the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of mutual struggle between the open source ad blocker community and those trying to circumvent it has been going on since the invention of ad blocking,” and it’s possible that Facebook will present its own solution soon.
The fact that the world’s largest social network has entered the fray is a clear sign of just how big a problem ad blockers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use ad blockers, according to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe; almost four times the number of those who used such software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s ad revenue.
However, the company is hunting for ad blockers on the desktop version, as mobile ad blockers are inefficient in Facebook’s social media mobile apps and Instagram, according to a spokesperson.
But still, advertising in the desktop version is a profitable enough article for Facebook to consider such a step a profitable investment.
Also Thursday, Facebook announced that it is going to update its “ad preferences” tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted.
On Thursday, Facebook said the new Adblock filters are a concern as they will also block some non-advertising content on the site.
“This will not be a positive experience for people and we plan to address this issue,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an official email.
Ad blockers are a crude tool, so we’ve focused instead on creating tools like Ad Preferences to put control into people’s hands.
Woman Moved to Swiss Autobahn in 'Obvious Suicide' Episode
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after a woman moved several vehicles on a freeway early Thursday morning in an apparent suicide attempt.
The incident occurred at A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay on the road in the dark "in a gesture of desperation" and was hit by several vehicles, police said in a statement.
Apparently trying to kill himself, the victim, a Swiss woman at the age of 49, was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several of the drivers involved have already been questioned, but the identity of some has not yet been established, police said, urging them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case was opened, a “logical” step in such a situation, said lawyer Gilles Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Is it possible to avoid a hit?
That’s what the prosecutor has to determine,” Hofstetter said.
Two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case — both involving a man walking in the dark on the freeway — a verdict was handed down that motorists could not expect an accidental encounter with a pedestrian on the freeway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reported.
Last year, the officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she struck and killed a man lying on an A1 near Payern on the night of August 2014.
A 22-year-old victim was drinking and losing consciousness on the road, the court heard.
The court found that the woman police officer — who responded to the emergency call — was driving the vehicle in a manner that was warranted and that the presence of a man on the road was a “completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday’s incident near Morges should call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus may have once been habitable, according to estimates from NASA’s new climate model.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model for studying the past of Venus, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climatologists.
The model was developed to determine whether Venus, with its hot anhydrous surface and atmosphere oversaturated with carbon dioxide, could ever have Earth-like conditions.
Scientists previously assumed that Venus's low rotational speed was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a rarefied atmosphere similar to Earth's, and still rotate slowly.
The model also considered the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more arid regions on the planet than on Earth, but once there was enough water and enough geographical variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
“According to the GISS model, Venus’ slow rotation puts its day side under the sun for almost two months at a time,” explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Henio in a press release.
This warms the planet’s surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, acting as an umbrella that protects the planet’s surface from a substantial portion of the sun’s heat.
The result is average climate temperatures that, surprisingly, are a few degrees colder than those on Earth today.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development that previously assumed specialists in the study of planets.
Although Venus may have once been habitable, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was scorched by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen evaporated, all that remained was a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect – that is, Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy to step down as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy left the post of coach and vice president of hockey activities Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing the lack of influence during the decision-making process in the team.
Executive Vice President/CEO of the Colorado team Joe Sakic confirmed the news and noted that the club will start looking for a new coach immediately.
“For the past three years, I have performed my duties as head coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey business with energy, passion and determination,” said Roy, 50, in a statement.
Over the summer, I thought long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needed and elevate it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey activities should ideally coincide with the vision of the organization.
He must also have a voice in decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions are not fulfilled at the moment.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
“Patrick informed me of his decision today,” Sakik said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach during his first season with Avalanche in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a win in the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and lost the playoffs the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced a score of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and five points behind the Wild team in the fight for a second preferential ticket to participate in the Western Conference.
A goaltender from the Hall of Fame, Roy won four Stanley Cups, two each with the Montreal Canadiens and one with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks and suspend strike
Working strikes on oil workers’ salaries in the North Sea have been suspended and all sides of the discussion are embarking on a new round of talks, leading representatives of the parties said.
Strikes against the oilfield service company Wood Group were sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea, operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and the Unite and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve ongoing disputes,” the joint statement said.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to take a fresh look at the issues.
The unions said their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was directed against potential wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut rates paid to contract employees working in the North Sea by about 9 percent this year due to negative market tensions.
The company’s rate cuts came after a 10 percent cut in rates for contract employees working offshore in 2014.
According to the company, additional cuts will give it the space it needs to overcome the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has cut thousands of jobs and announced plans to phase out oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations due to its mega-merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to falling prices for crude oil: the economic situation has worsened due to the decision to leave the European Union, adopted in June by the UK.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour conflicts to emerge in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the regional economy.
“In the North Sea, and across the country, we need an economy that works for most, not just some,” he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea in 2016, in contrast to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotational velocities of stars in the Pleiades cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler space telescope helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalog of the rotation speeds of stars in the Pleiades cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, as well as how the rotation periods correlate with the formation of planets.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the star’s mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system,” said Louise Riball, a research fellow at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
The Pleiades cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now only reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're spinning faster than they'll ever be again.
At their peak rotational velocities, these growing stars emit large amounts of stellar wind.
Traveling through the magnetic fields of stars, these winds have a retarding effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its speed of rotation begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable star spots — such as sunspots.
The latest catalogue of rotational velocities suggests that more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.
Riball compares stars to dancers: the larger ones make pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
“In the Pleiades, we see that those that spin slowly are usually more massive, whereas those that spin faster are usually very light stars,” Riball said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the properties of stars with the rotational velocities.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides a starting point for theoretical models of the rotation of stars, both younger and older," Riball said.
We still want to know a lot about how, where and why stars slow down their rotation and hang their “dance shoes” on a nail, figuratively speaking.
Riball and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of the Pleiades' rotational velocities in three new papers that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
The investigation related to the activities of a group of Ukrainian saboteurs detained in Crimea is being conducted by two agencies, Kommersant writes.
The FSB is collecting evidence of the involvement of detainees in the preparation of sabotage in the Crimea.
As previously reported, a resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar, Evgeny Panov, agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
According to him, as objects for sabotage, he considered the chemical plant "Titan" in Armenia, the oil base in Feodosia, the Kerch ferry, the gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airfields.
Law enforcers believe that it was possible to detain not all accomplices of saboteurs.
This, in particular, became the basis for the arrest of suspects in the Kiev district court of Simferopol, the newspaper notes.
Stanislav Cherchesov became the head coach of the Russian national football team
At the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Russian Football Union, it was decided to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov as the head coach of the Russian football team.
The contract with him will be designed for two years - until the end of the 2018 World Cup.
On August 11, the Executive Committee of the RFU appointed Stanislav Cherchesov as the head coach of the Russian football team.
This is a famous football player who previously played in the Moscow “Spartak” as a goalkeeper, as well as a coach with solid experience, who was the mentor of such Russian teams as the same “Spartak”, “Pearl-Sochi”, “Terek”, “Amkar”, “Dynamo”, as well as the Warsaw “Legia”, which became the winner of the national championship and the cup of the country.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed as soon as possible and is designed for two years.
Thus, it is he who has the obligation to prepare the national team for the 2018 world championship.
It is known that his coaching staff will include Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stauce, Vladimir Panikov.
There is information that the salary of the entire coaching staff will be 2.6 billion euros per year.
According to media reports, the RFU leadership set a goal for Stanislav Cherchesov to bring the Russian national team to the semi-finals and win medals.
As stated by the coach himself, as a priority, he considers the creation of a competitive environment in the team and is going to give players the opportunity to prove themselves.
Also, according to Cherchesov, he is glad that the choice fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of Cherchesov team of Russia will be held on August 31 in Antalya - it will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Earlier, the post of head coach of the Russian national football team was held by Leonid Slutsky, combining it with the coaching at the club CSKA.
He announced his resignation after the failed performance of the national team of Russia at Euro 2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the bad result of the team on himself.
Clamped between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
However, since gaining independence from South Africa in 1990, this country of 2.4 million people has achieved tremendous success, especially in the last few years.
The main reason for Namibia ' s success is that the Government pays great attention to education.
While people in developed countries take for granted free primary and secondary education, in many poor countries, secondary and even primary schools require tuition fees.
Moreover, governments are often advised to introduce “cost-recovery” training fees.
In Namibia, however, primary schooling is free.
Moreover, since 2015, secondary education has also become free.
The country’s authorities are also actively working in other important areas.
Malaria eradication efforts have reduced the number of annual cases by 97 per cent over the past decade.
Contrary to the international trend of rising inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
Compared to 1993, the Gini coefficient, which is the standard measure of income inequality, fell by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty rate fell from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) also declined, from almost 53% to less than 23%.
Namibia also has the highest freedom of speech rating in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country is well ahead of the United States and other rich countries.
In addition, the country has a favorable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the "Perception of Corruption Index", which consists of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now, with commodity prices falling, Namibia has managed to maintain high growth rates.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is about 25%, which is less than 1/3 of the debt level in the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least according to traditional methods of assessment, remains quite high – almost 28%.
And, like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high incidence of HIV/AIDS - almost 17% of the population is infected.
According to World Bank estimates, Namibia is among the countries with above-average income, but the authorities insist that their state is actually a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some of the difficulties inherent in underdeveloped economies.
The state has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
In the country, isolated nomadic tribes of hunter-gatherers live in the deserts, which in one way or another should be integrated into modern society, without losing their identity.
The integration of people who a quarter of a century ago were on the periphery of the world economy is not an easy task for any country.
This is even more difficult for Namibia: like any other country in the world, it faces the effects of climate change.
However, Namibia did not think to give up, the country solves the problems facing it.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities set about creating a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
It is noteworthy that competing political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap health care not only to its own citizens but also to its neighbours.
About 15-20% of visitors to health facilities in the northern regions of Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia talks about building a wall that would separate the country from its poor and corrupt neighbors.
Namibians realized that neighbors are not chosen, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - to share scarce water resources, take part in regional medical projects, encourage investment and student exchange.
In addition, the Namibian Government has rightly judged that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of the few at the expense of the many.
The authorities understand that revenues from Namibia’s natural resources need to be invested in infrastructure and production capacity.
They are also aware that it would be irresponsible not to seek maximum profits from the sale of the country’s resources, and are revising investment laws and mining contracts to make sure that this is the case.
Transparency is crucial to this process, which is why strong government support for free speech is so important.
As the head of state Hage Geingob noted, the media often say things that he does not like.
But after fighting for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms it has gained, the president says.
Not all of Namibia ' s key resources are finite.
Some - such as fisheries - are renewable, and the government is making every effort to conserve and strengthen them.
Every year more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries that start with serious shortcomings - racism, colonialism, inequality and low levels of development - can embark on a path to shared prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard about the "Golden of Varna" - the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 BC).
Perhaps this was the loudest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, during the excavations of the Varna necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artifacts were found - more than three thousand with a total weight of 6 kilograms.
Only one grave, known as Grave No. 43, yielded 990 gold objects weighing more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the world’s oldest gold may soon shift to the seemingly unobtrusive bead found by archaeologists in July this year.
And again in Bulgaria - in the prehistoric settlement known as Tell Yunatsite.
Unlike Varna, the port city, Tell Yunatsite is located far from the sea, near the village of Yunatsite Pazardzhik district.
The bead is a golden stripe rolled into a ring.
Yavor Boyadzhiev, head of excavations at Tell Yunatsite, dated the find to 4600 BC and stated that it was at least 200 years older than the gold of Varna.
The treasures of Varna, we recall, date from about the same period, 4600 - 4200 BC.
Technologies that allow to date metal with perfect accuracy do not exist at the moment.
How do you know which gold is older?
Evidently, Professor Boyadzhiev knows more than he told Reuters: “I am quite sure that Yunatsite gold is older than Varna gold.”
This is a find of extreme importance: it looks like a tiny object, but it is large enough to occupy a proper place in history.
In an interview with Reuters, Boyadzhiev said that in the near future, scientists will analyze the composition of the metal, as well as re- and more carefully study the archaeological layer where the gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the bead with the highest possible accuracy.
The location also explains a lot.
Tell Yunatsite is a famous settlement, even if you have never heard of it.
At present, Tell Yunatsite is considered the oldest "city" in Europe.
Tell was founded by the descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
During the following centuries, metal processing developed rapidly in this region, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
In the domestic historiography for this archaeological community there is a special name: Balkan-Carpathian metallurgical province.
In the 5th millennium BC, urban settlements began to appear around metalworking centers.
Today they are called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tell Yunatsite is perhaps the most ancient, since artifacts from 4900 BC were found here.
I would call Tell Yunacite a prototype of a modern city, although it is a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
“This place is a thousand years older than Sumer,” Boyadzhiev says, referring to the generally accepted view that urban culture originated in southern Mesopotamia – modern Iraq.
There arose the first cities in the usual sense of the word.
The excavations of Tell Yunatsite have been carried out since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists have excavated almost 12 hectares, which is about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of the fortress wall, which once reached three meters in height, were found.
Not much has survived from the houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish streets, public buildings, dense urban development, "business center" and residential outskirts.
Tell Yunatsite is often called the "Bird City": dozens of clay bird figures have been found here.
All the birds are depicted in a state of rest, hence the assumption that they were not decorative objects, but an object of local worship.
The "Bird City" was destroyed around 4100 BC - possibly by Indo-European tribes coming from the northeast.
Nomads had no cities, but they had horses and weapons.
Three-meter fortress walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists have found obvious signs of a brutal massacre: inside the houses were found the remains of old men, women and children with traces of wounds inflicted by battle axes.
New discoveries and new facts appear every year, changing the usual ideas about the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the "lost" first civilization of Europe, which originated in the Balkans.
A powerful incentive in the search for this civilization was the "gold of Varna", found relatively recently, in 1972.
It is logical that the golden luxury of Varna should have been preceded by something - something like a tiny golden bead created in Tella Yunatsite.
Porsche has artificially aged the model 911 Targa
Officially, it is stated that the preparation of the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is carried out manually by specialists of the department who work with serial machines.
"Retro-arch" is, for example, in the special color of the body Etna Blue, which was developed back in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model - even the model logo is painted in this color.
In addition, the targa received branded white graphics along the sides and special 20-inch wheels RS Spyder, as well as some details of the design of the body, painted in "white-gold metallic".
The interior of the retro lines is noticeably smaller: it differs, by and large, gray-blue range of design, new seats with extended ranges of electrical regulation and trimmed with black anodized steel thresholds with the logo of the division.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive a car case and a richly decorated album with photos of the production process.
The power plant specialists of Porsche Exclusive did not touch: retro-tart on the characteristics quite coincides with the serial.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with a turbocharged volume of 3.0 liters, developing 420 hp and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S is able to accelerate to 100 km / h in 4 seconds.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released in a limited edition, but neither its volume nor the cost of each particular sports car is reported.
Facebook and ad blockers unleashed an “arms race”
The recent introduction of Facebook technology that prevented the hiding of advertising on the pages of the social network, provoked the developers of solutions to block advertising in response.
AdBlock Plus has released an “antidote”, but Facebook plans to soon make it useless.
So AdBlock Plus advertised its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time
The social network said that in an effort to deceive the new technology of “unblockable” advertising, the solution from AdBlock Plus, along with commercial ads, blocks many ordinary posts from friends or pages.
Facebook has expressed regret about this policy AdBlock Plus and promised to soon solve the problem.
According to a source among the developers of the social network TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the desktop site Facebook, will be ready in the coming hours.
Thus, the social network and blockers unleashed a kind of “arms race”, trying to beat each other, the affected party was users who missed interesting entries from friends or saw ads where they are not used to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of ad blocking have been hotly debated in recent times.
In Murmansk, the rapist will be brought to justice <0xC2><0xB7> Evening Murmansk.
His case has already been investigated by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation for the Murmansk region.
The charge against the 54-year-old man is very serious - the commission of violent acts of a sexual nature.
The investigation established that at the end of November 2015, the defendant in the area of Pavlova Street in Murmansk committed sexual acts with violence against a 20-year-old girl.
The sanction of this article provides for a maximum penalty of up to six years ' imprisonment.
Dongfeng will bring to Russia crossvan Fengguang 370 and pickup Rich New - website Driving www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of a growing class of cars in China, combining the advantages of a minivan and a crossover.
Another announced Russian premiere is the pickup Rich New.
Many Western companies of the Moscow International Motor Show this year decided to ignore, so the emptiness of the Crocus Expo exhibition halls will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, a powerful front will be the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has large views of the Russian market and intends to offer our motorists a number of interesting new products in the near future.
One of them will be the crossvan Dongfeng Fengguang 370, which went on sale in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (just under 550 thousand rubles at the current exchange rate).
For Russians, such a price tag is unlikely to shine, and the issue of supplies to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 on the results of June sales managed to get to the 11th place in the list of the best-selling minivans, although due to the large ground clearance (175 mm) and protective plastic bodywork on the lower perimeter of the body, it can be attributed to crossovers.
Crossvan is built on the front-wheel drive platform of the younger Fengguang 360 model, the 370th has the same wheelbase in 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm vs 4510 mm), the design is more solid, and the equipment is richer.
The salon is decorated with wooden slats, but the large vertical touch screen shown in the photo "like Tesla" on the center console was only on early exhibition copies of the crossvan, and cars with "music" were sold more simply.
Five of the seven seats fold easily, forming a flat loading area with a length of 1650 mm, the maximum volume of the trunk is 1500 liters.
The engine for Fengguang 370 provides only one - 1.5-liter gasoline "atmosphere" with a capacity of 115 hp, coupled with a 5-speed manual transmission.
The manufacturer is modestly silent about the dynamic qualities of the car, but promises a budget-friendly appetite of the owner at the level of 6.7 l/100 km.
Pickup Rich New is a well-known to Russians Nissan NP300 Navara of the previous generation, but with a slightly refined Chinese design.
Despite the morally outdated design, this model is still in stable demand among the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unpretentious "working horse".
At a similar price, Rich New will certainly interest Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become prohibitively expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines to choose from: gasoline 2.4 liters (137 hp) or turbodiesel 2.5 liters (116 hp).
The gearbox is only mechanics, the drive - on the rear wheels, but there are modifications and with a rigidly connected "front".
There will be at the booth of Dongfeng and the new flagship sedan A9, its Russian premiere, the representative office of the Chinese company announced back in June.
Minvan-like crossovers in the Chinese market are becoming more and more, one of the latest innovations - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Russian Dongfeng line consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 Cross hatchback.
For seven months of this year, the dealers of the Chinese company sold 696 cars in our country.
Notifications for transport tax will cease to be sent by mail - website Driving www.zr.ru

All Russian car owners are accustomed to the scheme that has not changed in years: in summer and autumn they receive receipts for the payment of transport tax for the previous year by mail.
However, this year many of them will not wait.
The fact is that the tax inspection without too much noise changed the procedure for notifying citizens.
For those who are registered in the "Personal Account of the Taxpayer" on the official website of the Agency nazakon.ru, notifications will come in electronic form.
The inspection automatically considered such Russians online users and deleted them from the standard, “paper” mailing list.
The innovation will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.
Everyone else will still receive the usual letters.
However, it is possible to return to the old scheme and the owners of the account on the site.
To do this, they will have to visit the tax office in August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and convenient.
The notification will appear in the "personal account" immediately after writing, while the letter will go for several days and may be completely lost.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet service of the tax inspection exceeded 18 million people, which will allow the department to seriously save on mailing.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection website is clearly not enough to inform citizens about the changed order.
Some could register in a “personal account” to receive a one-time service and have long forgotten about it.
These people will not wait for notices by mail and, without knowing it, will fall into the category of defaulters with all the ensuing consequences.
Access to the "Personal Account of the Taxpayer" is carried out in three ways: through the account of the portal gosuslugi.ru, by means of an electronic signature or by entering the login and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained personally at any branch of the tax inspectorate (regardless of the place of registration).
We remind you that this year the transport tax must be paid before December 1.
Notifications began in July.
The tuning of the Mercedes-Benz G-Class, in which refinements are aimed at achieving a very high return, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not bother the masters of the company G-Power, who took up the modification of the sports version of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its passion for BMW cars, but nothing human is alien to its masters.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63 - 571-strong flying sledgehammer with aerodynamics of the tank and acceleration to a hundred in 5.4 seconds?
Inflating the “muscles” of the crazy “helic”, the masters took advantage of the advantages that the 5.5-liter inflatable “eight” opens.
But the dynamics of acceleration to a hundred has improved by an indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now the flying "brick" is capable of a breakthrough in 5.3 s.
However, accelerations from average speeds are probably given to him noticeably better.
The speed ceiling is frightening: if the standard G 63 is faster than 210 km / h does not drive, then a tuning all-terrain vehicle with a deactivated electronic "collar" is able to squeeze 250 km / h.
Externally, the car is almost indistinguishable from its original factory source, with the exception of other wheels - 23-inch Hurricane RR dimension 305/35 ZR 23.
The luxury division of Mercedes-Maybach has announced an amazing conceptual coupe with a length of 6 m, which will be presented as part of the Elegance Competition in Pebble Beach.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the “green sub-brand” BMW i and will promote its electric models under a separate brand.
In the coming years, at least four eco-friendly novelties are expected to appear.
