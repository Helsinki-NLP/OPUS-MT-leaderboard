Republican Party's strategy against Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat voter fraud.
However, the Brennan Center calls such a fraud a myth, saying that voter fraud is less common in the U.S. than the number of people who die after a lightning strike.
In fact, Republican attorneys have recorded only 300 cases of voter fraud in the U.S. over the past decade.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for the organization of federal elections.
And in this spirit, most U.S. governments have enacted new laws since 2009 that make it difficult to vote or register.
This phenomenon saw a surge after the November 2010 election, during which 675 new Republican representatives were added in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting voting rights in 41 states were submitted in 2011 alone.
New election laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws limit the period for elections in advance, invalidate the right to register on the electoral roll on the day of the elections and deprive citizens with a criminal record of their right to vote.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
The first state to implement this requirement was Indiana.
The constitutionality of Indian law was confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008.
The Republican authorities were in a hurry to extend this procedure to other states.
Over the past two years, they have supported such bills in 34 states to force voters to present photo IDs.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e., 21 million people of voting age, do not have a photo ID issued by their state’s government office.
In addition, about five million new voters did not have such an identity card in 2012.
In addition, obtaining the required identity card often costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect mainly young people, members of minorities and people with low incomes.
Twenty-five percent of African-Americans, 15 percent of people with incomes below $35,000, 18 percent of citizens over 65, and 20 percent of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters for their fondness for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their school in several states.
On the other hand, the same States allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who prefer Republican candidates to use the cards issued by those clubs in elections.
Until 2004, no state required proof of citizenship for elections.
Arizona introduced the first such requirement.
Since 2011, about 12 states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
It should be noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer the Democratic Party.
In 2011, Republican lawmakers backed legislation in eight states that scrapped voter registration on election day.
In addition, they have restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who wish to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped to register some 10 million people.
However, the measures taken after 2009 caused a 17% decrease in the number of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In five other states, Republican lawmakers have passed laws aimed at shortening the period for early elections.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, African-Americans made up 33% of voters who voted in advance, even though African-American voters in that state were only 13%.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
They made up only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who represented 76% of all voters, accounted for only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Democratic governors have vetoed several bills.
In order to suspend the validity of the most controversial laws, even the Attorney General of the United States intervened.
The damage was partially reduced.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring the submission of a photo ID card.
However, the newly introduced rules will indisputably hinder the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics speak above all about the bias of the laws passed and consider them to be an obvious attempt to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that the states where these laws were passed represent 171 of the 270 votes in the electorate needed to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: to undergo an examination or not?
The PSA test produced sometimes erroneous results that were wrongly negative or even wrongly positive, which led to unnecessary medical interventions.
All this increased the hesitancy of men who were already so reluctant to go to the examination at all.
To be investigated or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
The studies conducted in the USA showed a high level of contamination between the individual groups tested, so it is difficult to interpret these results and bring valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found a difference in mortality between patients who underwent the examination and those who did not.
This study also showed, after a 12-year interval, that those who did not go to the examination had a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastasis.
Therefore, I recommend an examination from the age of 50 or from the age of 40 if your direct relative had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive types of cancer and such types that are inert.
It is therefore necessary to properly explain to the patient the degree of danger of his type of cancer, offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily treat prostate cancer that does not have an impact on life in the long term, and focus in these cases rather on active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated because their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
Rather, we will suggest active surveillance and offer treatment in case of disease progression.
Increasingly, and with greater precision, we are setting criteria to help decide which species to treat and which not.
However, I recommend that you do an examination.
But it is important to interview a doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo an examination or not.
In collaboration with the International Urological Society, Movember has created a tool that allows you to evaluate the pros and cons of PSA testing.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer.
Despite advances in research, it seems to be the best means to reduce disease risks by adopting the principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthily and moved enough, up to 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
“If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Research Society.
In contrast, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
A certain percentage also remains completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Research Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, even as the number of smokers declines.
Cigarettes are responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely harmful to human health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Quebec government.
10 years after a smoker quits smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
Weight (kg)
Body weight and obesity are another risk factor for the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
“The research suggests that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer,” the report adds.
Nutrients
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
With too high consumption, it can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also advisable to avoid sausages, for which the same applies.
Preserving meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“They can cause damage to the body’s cells and lead to the development of cancer,” the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, the research has not yet come to clear conclusions.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
Although one study suggests a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another suggests an increase in prostate cancer.
Even the effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly proven.
Mr. Beaulieu further insists on the importance of talking about his concerns and family precedents with his doctor.
"Being screened doesn't mean you'll have cancer."
Higgs boson investigated
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused a legitimate stir last summer.
There is an opinion that this boson is involved in the mechanism that is responsible for all the matter in the universe.
And then there's the last particle whose existence is predicted by a standard model - our best or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - that has not yet been empirically observed.
However, there is still no 100% certainty among physicists that it is a Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle at our disposal that is very similar to the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data released this week during the great physical congress in Kyoto rather confirm it, but all the data is still missing so that we can be absolutely sure.
However, let's assume that this is a Higgs boson, since the risk of error appears to be small, and let's look at what it is.
There is an indisputable law in this world according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule can not be circumvented - and do not try to do it too hard, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that a similar law applies to it: Pauli's exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" roughly creates some of their properties.
It also divides physical particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find orderly citizens, or fermions, obediently adhering to the Pauli principle.
And at the other end there are barefoot, vile anarchists who don't value anything at all - certainly not this principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (by the way absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in Berkeley laboratories: the mesons that we leave unnoticed here, and the "force particles" with which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson is probably in some way related.
However, it must be said that these bosons are not as exotic animals as one might think.
If you read this article, it is thanks to a boson with an unusual banality: a photon, or "particle of light", which is the "carrier" of electromagnetic force.
When a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "interrupts" the electromagnetic field at that particular location, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "interference" arises an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the bosons, the "bearers of force".
A more stable field
So is the Higgs boson, except that you have to "interrupt" another field, the Higgs field, in order for this boson to appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; very high energy values must be reached for its excitation, similar to the frozen level of a pond, where only a very large boulder is present.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge accelerator part as the accelerator in the CERN laboratory - a large hadron accelerator with reciprocal bundles is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - in order to develop such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to clarify the relationship between the Higgs and matter.
Neither all particles nor all materials react with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never keep on the refrigerator by itself.
Similarly, not all particles react with the Higgs field: those that do have a certain mass, while others (like a photon, let's look at it) don't.
And Mrs. Nováková asks what all this research is about, what will it "bring us"?
From a scientific point of view, this is a confirmation of the validity of the Standard Model (SM), which allows physicists to examine any discrepancy between the observations and the predictions of SM.
In addition, many physicists literally wish to be able to find them, because the slightest difference could open up the space of "new physics" and fix some gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model still has huge flaws, does not bring any clarification of gravity (ooh!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the universe's mass (again, ooh!).
However, CERN has so far failed to detect such discrepancies.
Testimonials
The reactions of these researches in the everyday life of Mr. and Mrs. Novak can only be very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to believe that there will be none.
At the very beginning of the 1960s, the laser pioneers in Bell Labs had no idea of the revolution their work would spark.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
Physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (previous beams were pulsed) in 1962, I have already said this - the laser was initially considered such a "laboratory toy".
Just imagine...
In addition, the application can also result from all the tools that surround the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work on optics.
This sensor, although not originally planned by Boyle, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that activities around the LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but it does mean that you really never know...
Palliative care - The best way to get out of life... <0xEC><0x9E><0x90><0xEC><0x84><0xB8><0xED><0x9E><0x88> Le Devoir
Through its Commission for the Dignity of Dying, Quebec has recently become involved in the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is expected to continue soon, and a bill is being drafted.
Much work remains to be done in this crucial area.
Le Devoir magazine tried to look at this question in more detail.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was eating him gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years to live, and it's been seven," he says without emotion on his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"It's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its job: immense weakness makes it impossible for him to go to the toilet alone or just eat himself.
He looks at the delicious-looking breakfast in resignation and agrees to help him eat.
He is brave and even smiles, talking to strangers who stop by, bringing him medicine, offering him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is to get rid of the diarrhea, it degrades me," he says.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
“You learn all your life that men pee standing up,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the stage of a child is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on what person's ability" to accept the return, the psychologist says.
In the opinion of many palliative care professionals, crucial moments take place at the very heart of such a return.
Patients who enter the home with Victor-Gadbois palliative care all suffer from cancer.
Their prognosis is a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who care for them does not provide them with so-called "curative" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "on suffocation in full consciousness."
But the disease has allowed me to discover my children.
“I have good kids,” he adds.
"I don't have any more wishes in my life," she says, and then she lets us put a breathing apparatus on her.
However, he is still looking forward to his son’s last visit from Italy in the coming days.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, body care is provided with the help of nutrition.
This is what palliative care looks like when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Québec, there is one bed of palliative care per 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little if we realize that we're all going to die one day.
Here, life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the home.
Whether it is a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, he can be given, for example, a sip of brandy or pepsi, to taste.
Diabetics no longer need to watch their sugar levels.
Death is a part of everyday life.
Last night they brought beer to Mr. X, who died later that night.
This morning, his son will finish his beer in honor of his late father.
“We are helping patients as well as their loved ones,” said Nathalie Savard, director of the care service.
In Victor-Gadbois' home, the days go by, but they don't resemble each other.
In addition to the ninety-three-year-old man, who rejoices at the last meeting with his family, thoroughly grounded on pillows, while they toast in his honor, a thirty-six-year-old man dies tragically surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children after having tried all the options to survive.
"For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds that are designed for people with cancer under 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who come to the Victor-Gadbois home come here from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care that is designed to alleviate suffering once the patient reaches the final stage of his life, whether it is at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and the Grand Montréal Society for Home Palliative Care, specialize more or less exclusively in the care provided to cancer patients.
And it is precisely this fundamental unavailability of health care in Quebec that has led many palliative care physicians to fear the passage of the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation signed by top palliative care leaders such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not powerful enough to ensure that all people have access to quality palliative care before they can agree to euthanasia.
She says she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in tremendous pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
He fears that patients will not ask to be killed because they are not receiving proper care.
And at the same time, many oncologists take care of their patients until the last moments, regardless of the unfavorable prognosis.
Hél<0xC3><0xA8>ne Richard's chances of survival were already minimal when she left the demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was ending treatment, she replied that she regretted that I had stopped fighting, she told us.
And yet she told me it was over!
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die thank their attending physicians for not fulfilling their wishes when the palliative care team relieved their pain.
However, it must be said that palliative care is definitely not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Society for Home Palliative Care of the Grand Montréal region, patients resist pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives, which put the patient to sleep until the moment of death, whether shock or whether the sedatives are given to him permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
A patient who is not relieved of pain will increasingly have access to palliative sedation.
Sick people who are not sedated always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to give me euthanasia,” it means “I want you to take away my pain.”
The report was made possible by a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Real Estate Scandals in Quebec
Road administration officials, construction and public works entrepreneurs, political party lobbyists and experts on the Italian mafia are still telling what they know about the amazing “system” in which the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafias mix.
This "industry" came to Quebec taxpayers very expensive especially between 1990 and 2000.
“It’s interesting how the system has crumbled since we took action,” said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec lawmaker and former chief of police in Montreal.
It triggered a scandal in 2011 following a thorough investigation into the misappropriation of funds in connection with the Quebec road construction contracts, which then-Liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest approved only after long delays.
The Duchesneau report confirmed a direct link between industry, the opaque financing of parties and the corruption of civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he says, "only the Department of Transportation has saved a billion dollars on contracts," when some people have kept their instincts to get a share of them!
Charbonneau's commission "has already led to the resignation of two mayors," he adds, hoping to "unmask the cunning of some people."
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also engaged in the fight against its army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the police "Marteau's companions", who since 2009 have ensured that the Montreal "cartel of moneylenders" significantly alleviated the inflation of orders...
In recent weeks, they have carried out a number of searches and accused a number of municipal representatives of fraud and corruption, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of one of the suburbs.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just stepped down as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third-largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Transport engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have already been formally charged.
Lino Zambito caused a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanism of the "system" of procurement.
During these years, he himself donated 3% of the value of the contracts he had obtained in Montréal to a mafia-related intermediary, who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal party, for which the mayor, Gérald Tremblay, was a candidate.
Zambito was generous on all sides after 2000 and donated more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, but especially to the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fund-raiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with pipelines whose prices he overpriced
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked very fast.
Gilles Surprenant, a former traffic engineer, described it in great detail to the committee: within ten years, he had received gifts from construction companies, invitations to field trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches, and pocket money worth a total of $736,000 in exchange for orders with pipelines for which he overcharged.
Other public officials from the transport sector admitted that they were paid rewards for overvaluing invoices by 30% to 40% through false multi-jobs.
The mayor's party organizer, Martin Dumont, then accused Tremblay of unashamedly turning a blind eye to the concurrent budget that brought dirty money into his coffers.
Based on these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montréal into a widespread crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to issue a warning signal.
As mayor of the Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, he has been advocating since 2010 against the sale of municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million to promoters right in the middle of a booming real estate business.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
About the investigation, which will finally be launched, he says that he “pulls the strings in an effort to understand the functioning of the ant-destroyed system to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits.”
She said the process was "painful but positive".
We are in the process of clearing the wound, but it is necessary to set up our own investigation unit in Montreal and to ensure that these dubious practices cannot be reversed.
It's like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "MPs informed of this deception" if they do not get involved in these scams!
He estimates that 70% of campaign finance in Québec comes from dirty money, and ironically adds, “I’ve heard it’s just a weak decoction of reality.”
The Quebec government is proposing to limit gifts to parties to $100, but that will not solve the situation, he said: "Unless the election spending is strictly limited, dirty money will not disappear from politics."
He proposes a comprehensive control of the system of awarding public contracts and financing parties: "We can no longer fall lower; if we focus boldly on the essence of things, we can build again on stronger foundations and with greater control and compliance with the laws."
If this story has tarnished the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends everyone who mocks him to look at their own backyard...
PSG is not FC Barcelona.
You and PSG have set a whole new pace this season.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went together, or a completely new dimension of PSG.
Great players came to us.
Every day I get closer to them.
The technical team also helped me a lot.
Every day these facts allow me to increase the level of the game.
In games, it’s easier.
In football, everything goes very fast.
But I'm not losing my head.
From my beginnings in preparation at INF Clairefontaine to my move to Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed by degrees.
You are therefore taking advantage of the competitive environment introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The reinforcements from this summer are accustomed to playing matches at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it follows that a player like me then has a greater appetite for the match and wants to give maximum performance.
Besides, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in connection with my position.
He has assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
And does Ancelotti have the right word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all technicians.
Today he has no equal in the 1st league and is among the best European coaches.
He has a lot of experience and has won a lot of titles with top teams.
He also worked with great players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a reassuring conversation with him.
I had a lot of injuries.
The confidence he gives me is another reason for my performance.
What do you think about the first half of the PSG season?
In the Premier League, Lyon took the lead.
But we remain in the loop.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we advanced very easily to the semi-finals.
What is your club’s goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
Anything can happen now.
But we definitely want to be a tough opponent for quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group in front of Porto first so that we can play in the eighth-finals at home.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
The budget already has...
In order for Paris to become a major European club, it must win titles and make history.
That's not the case today.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to make this plan a reality.
And would it be a big failure not to win the Premier League like last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win the league title this year.
We missed a lot last season.
In May, we were disappointed because we had the chance to win.
We had a great season.
We scored 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points you are a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more amazing season.
I think it's gonna work this year.
Even though big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are striving for the title, I think we have weapons at our disposal to defeat them.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
It’s not unusual to expect a lot from us, given what we’ve invested here and what kind of players we have.
We totally accept that.
It's a fact that if we beat Troyes 4-0 at home and there's still something to blame in the newspapers, it's not very pleasant.
You wonder what more people want from you.
You can’t win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a play style.
You need time to build a team.
In the Champions League, we proved that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, which did not fight for the second season in the semifinals, and they also invested a lot of money!
Given the sums invested, you would be expected to have 15 points ahead of the others!
This offends other clubs and the French league.
Clubs Lyon and Marseille, which did not do well last season, moved to the next stage with the new PSG.
It shows how amazing the Premier League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say to ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have managed to win.
It seems that PSG relies on Zlatan Ibrahimovic for everything.
It is good that it is said that there is an "addiction to Zlatan".
This means that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and scores a lot of goals.
That's why he came here and proves he's a Premier League star.
Everywhere he went, he proved to be a great player, a world star.
In our team, we respect both the person and the player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has achieved is truly exceptional.
This has led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow side by side.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French national team?
Like disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, due to injury, I could not play as I had imagined.
But I've experienced it, and I've come out stronger.
I’m still playing good games today.
This is what I have been hoping for since I joined the team.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe it to ourselves to make our performance exemplary.
How do you see the first months of Didier Deschamps leading the national team?
The results speak for him.
We are in a good place in the World Cup Qualifiers.
The coach chooses strictly, is close to the players and can inspire for victory.
So was Laurent Blanc.
I don’t want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euros.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead our team to Brazil.
Is the 1-1 draw of October 16 a solid starting game in Spain?
This game gave me confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never seen such a match in my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin, you can pay and sell without banks
All the negatives of current central bank-based financial transactions, identified transactions and processing costs between recipients.
Moreover, as is often the case with these technologies, there is an obvious political outlook: the belief that the current financial system, built on banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (translatable to dollars, euros...), and a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between two partners.
Thanks to 15,000 computers connected to the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin exchange rate first reached a maximum of $30 ($23) in June 2011, five months later it fell to $2, today it is hovering around $10 (a list of exchange rates is available on bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to the world exchange for real money or financial products, this is nothing impressive.
And yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual finance, which was published in October.
Bitcoin has been described as “the most successful virtual money,” “competing the dollar and the euro,” and “the equivalent of regular money.”
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money in that it is like the “credits” used to advance a video game that a person acquires through a game or that he or she can purchase (and sometimes exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the central authority checks and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are depositaries of books of current accounts, controllers, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually between two e-mail addresses.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
The file of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double-key encryption system.
Thus, the network can verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in a public ledger of current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key phase is to write this new transaction into this book.
It takes place by solving a mathematical problem assigned to computers, the solver of which, a temporary central banker, will have the right to write this additional line.
This is a phase of file slicing; i.e., transforming a huge file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
Computers "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it, only then "cut" the whole.
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific imprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes will easily check its correctness.
The transaction is then indestructibly displayed connected to the chain of all other transactions; any modification would change the imprint.
If the user wanted to pay twice the same money very quickly in a row (within ten minutes), the network will confirm only one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned, because each of them has a different imprint.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this reward is divided regularly by two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but they can be divided up to a hundred millionth, so there is room for margin.
The difficulty of the given task also increases with the increasing level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its ups and downs.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and stored bitcoins have been stolen.
“The loophole used does not relate to the protocol itself,” assures Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real-money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Notable players such as Wikipedia reject gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed a book of current accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "huge discounts" were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, a bitcoin-to-gold conversion company.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a pedagogical book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
Its system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (with real money) or contactless mobile payment, but it uses a Bitcoin system to authenticate transactions that are thus cheaper.
In addition, the carrier manages its identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up for merchants where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
It is enough to give an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by the phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems and move to more horizontal systems.
“Bitcoin will take some time to assert itself, but 2013 could be a decisive year,” he predicts.
In addition, the ECB’s report foresees a reassessment of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and U.S. forces are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not expect everything from us.
The greatest damage was done to the people in the Afghan countryside, whom we punished because we considered them terrorists.
And so did we, after all, we lost 88 soldiers killed, and what about all the injuries and mutilations.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but they are often peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are now experiencing tolerance and frequent help from local insurgents, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will decline.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the tops of the mountains planted with almonds thanks to French loans, took place in an orderly manner.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without being attacked by helicopters.
By the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be active in Kabul.
Since their unstoppable advance between 1994 and 1996, conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty at the time, and the land was in blood and fire as a result of fighting between various resistance groups.
Their taking control of the country was then considered a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid a price for the obscurity of these villagers, who were completely dominated by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved in our time.
The former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban are all in agreement in their efforts to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main dignitaries from the war against the Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became traffickers, seized state-owned land that they sold as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and took advantage of huge U.S. contracts for subcontractors.
They had discredited themselves; most of them had never even been in combat.
From what I've heard in the campaigns, people want a government that's not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the way those who have been able to take advantage of America’s generosity will: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its associated ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they came to know the modern world, and its benefits caught their attention.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul is currently home to 5 million people, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, public schools are full, girls and boys go there.
These young people will have to be provided with work, they no longer want to return to the obscurity of the former parties or to the corruption of some representatives.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; they watch TV and Turkish TV shows that show the modern world everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that head it be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the struggle against the Soviet army are already restoring provincial militias that will be beyond the control of the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong local identity influence, should enjoy a degree of decentralization modeled after Western states, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so the post of prime minister, which had existed since the adoption of the constitution in 1964, was abolished.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and earlier.
No industry has been restored, no dam is functioning, no major irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Preference is given to private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
Rumor has it that Afghanistan has vast mineral wealth.
And this only fueled the feeling that the Western states were there only to seize it.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on site and without the means to transport raw materials across the mountains, no mining can take place.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeological teams (supported by the World Bank) the opportunity to explore the vast Buddhist site in order to retain the role of the most important employer in the entire province.
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which a large part of imports and exports depend, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement envisages the continuation of common types of assistance: girls' and boys' lyceums, French departments at universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the "winning heart and soul" initiative has been working on the difficult task of coordinating aid and military activities, within which the "civil-military steps" service of the Ministry of Defense (Cemic) operated, which was abolished in 2012, but achieved a number of successes in the field of common interest thanks to a small number of French agricultural NGOs.
These works, involving a large number of local workers, helped to quell the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of arable land.
What memory will we leave behind after <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion in military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very demanding in these valleys, which are often at altitudes above 2 000 m.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural assistance from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free these farmers from the revolts led by foreign groups, they wish, in their own words, to obtain a small amount of civil aid for their benefit, which would be properly controlled and would affect them directly.
Difficult work on the Egyptian constitution
President Mohamed Morsi is playing another game of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history due to the proclamation of a constitution that temporarily grants him unlimited powers, he decided to play vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of the opinion of all the others, that the Constitutional Assembly would approve the final text the next day.
Less than a week ago, the head of state gave this assembly another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text, which has been amended many times, which weakens the country's constitutional stability and leads to legal speculation.
This new initiative only further strengthened the country's division.
From the point of view of the opposition, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium", continues to "violate his word" and "stomp the law".
However, his supporters say it is a means of dealing with the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and speeding up the transitional process.
A referendum will be held in two weeks.
This is a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of the text to the Egyptians to clarify the article after the article.
It is also a way for the president to regain national and democratic legitimacy while the whole country is in the throes of protests.
As he confirmed in an interview with the American weekly Time, Mohamed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favor.
Especially because this hastily organised vote puts the Egyptian people before an ultimatum: 'Either you approve my text, or I will retain unlimited powers', which should otherwise end when the new constitution is approved.
And in this particular atmosphere yesterday, 85 deputies of the aforementioned constituent assembly with a large majority of Islamists approved the text.
Most of the Liberals were absent from the vote.
In mid-November, shortly before the proclamation of the Constitution, they slammed the door, saying that they had no opportunity to assert their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society or members of religious minorities imitated their step.
In order to achieve a quorum, 11 substitutes were hurriedly added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising, then, that articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
Commentators further paused to note that one of the few disputes that day revolved around... hours of prayer, when some committee members held the view that the meeting room hours were not set correctly.
The text, which was voted on last night, consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, remains ultimately consistent with the 1971 version of the Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the fundamental requirements, hoped to replace the term "principles" with the term "rules", which would allow for stricter enforcement.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected is a sign of their goodwill and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," the liberals object, who see it as a rhetorical problem.
Islamization of the Constitution is carried out through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which entrusts al-Azhar University with an advisory role, in particular on issues of checking the conformity of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because “persons called to expression are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
The beginnings of theocracy can be seen in this.”
The liberals’ fears are further fuelled by the fact that the next university rector should be less moderate than the current one.
“So far, there has been no concrete religious effect.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulama, but university workers, many of them graduated from French schools,” said Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a paper on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, they agree that "there may be contradictions as to the interpretation of Article 220, because the terms used therein belong to the religious vocabulary.
There is, in particular, a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic legal science, note ed.].
And in the future, the question may arise as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to comment on this.”
In addition to religious sites, the text approved yesterday has been heavily criticized for the expanded powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant restriction on them compared to the former regime.
Another controversial point: the powers entrusted to the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the representatives of the army, the verification of the defense budget will not be carried out by the parliament, but by the National Defense Council.
Furthermore, civil proceedings in military courts will not be prohibited, as demanded by the association for the protection of human rights.
These associations speak of their doubts in the context of the text which they claim is directed against freedom.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and insult continues to be prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, in particular for the press.
Moreover, no article deals with the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to make a televised speech last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will then manifest on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the navel of the world and the sea from a saturated solution of salt
The Promised Land combines the grandeur of biblical truths, modern comfort, and the inviolability of nature.
AaF has identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Worshiping the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that God’s mercy will descend on all who enter this “bath”.
And Galilee - the place of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding, walking on water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
Here believers will walk the Path of Pain, or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the trial took place, passes through the streets of the Old Town and leads to the Temple of the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha - to the place of the crucifixion, to the stone of the anointing and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built on the place where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew, from which they made a cross for Jesus’ crucifixion.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest site for Jews - the Wailing Wall, the rest of the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Make your way through the vertical
The ruins of the fortress of Masada remained a secret hiding place from the enemy, which Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
The ruin is located on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who are engaged in mountaineering can get to it by their own forces.
The others will be taken to this historic mountain by a cable car.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is the famous Hermon ski resort, which experiences a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
This ski paradise is served by a shuttle bus from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods supposedly lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit the unique museums
There are about 300 museums in the country.
You won’t be able to visit all of them in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, which is located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Tel Aviv Museum of Art is also worth a visit.
His paintings are widely represented by Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon, you can visit the Al Basha Spa Museum, which presents visitors with several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with figurines of bath users and spa nurses from that time.
In Caesarea it is worth visiting the unique private museum of Ralli, where you can admire the statues of Dal<0xC3><0xAD> and Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and gifts are strictly refused.
The fifth museum, the Yad Vashem Museum in Tel Aviv, tells the story of one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children's Memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk in - and you find yourself in total darkness.
The stars are glittering.
And these are the names of the Jewish children, and the names of the countries in which they perished.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improve your health
Israel’s three main spas are located on the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea coasts.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
It is interesting that in the Red Sea you can swim even in the winter months, because the water temperature in it does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and people bathe in it all year round.
The Dead Sea, by the way, is the most peculiar sea in the world, located at the lowest land point on the planet - at 417 m below sea level.
The azure water in it is a saturated saline solution that easily keeps even people who can not swim on the surface.
The surrounding countryside is unrealistically beautiful.
Come here to undergo treatment using salt water - brine, and healing mud, which can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to cure your swollen nerves.
Touch the mysterious ancient past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through them passed the famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
References to this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is the place where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which they lived a long and happy life together.
Tourists really love wandering the narrow streets, named after the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you cling to the walls in the alley of "your" sign, your luck will be favorably inclined.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to be photographed.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can take a walk through the Roman theater and "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully reconstructed theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, a word
If you are going to Israel, you do not need to worry about your imperfect English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian in this country.
It is better to take money with you on the trip not in euros, but in dollars, which you can easily exchange for shekels (now 1 dollar is about 3.8 shekels).
The city's main transportation is buses, but there is a high-speed tram in Jerusalem and Haifa is the only metro line in the country with six stations connecting the lower city with the upper one.
It's basically an underground cable car.
Travelling by all kinds of public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can drive 1.5 hours with a change.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, he stops working in markets, shops and in public transport.
And on Sunday morning, the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels you will only get kosher food: with the exception of pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes that contain a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of dishes from lamb and beef, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish porridge hummus, various types of sauces, balls of ground chickpeas - falafel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
However, there are a lot of well-fed cats that gracefully "wander to their own taste".
In the evening you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Predecessor cats love crowded places and are eager to indulge in every delicacy.
Renting a car will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance - 15 dollars a day.
And renting a bike will cost about 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to the museum cost an average of 30 shekels.
Expressed in numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
To get to know the country and relax came the most citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The country was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the abolition of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Great and powerful" will announce it to Moscow: emigrants will save money on language
While MPs and human rights defenders are still debating the law on compulsory language exams, there are already fraudsters in the country who sell "counterfeit" certificates
Every year, 13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn enough money to support families at home.
On December 1, the law came into force, according to which every working migrant will be required to pass the exam on knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services sector, housing and communal services, lifestyle and retail.
FMS, however, promises that over time, relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the exams will consist not only of language skills, but also of Russian history and the foundations of law.
Knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed in order to obtain and extend a work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law does not apply even to people who have successfully achieved certification and obtained an academic degree before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefit, Conviction and Protection of Rights
The network of test sites will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian Language, the University of Friendship between Nations, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take exams in all cities; more than 160 such centers are already open in Russia.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing was also supported by deputies of the State Duma and the FMS (Federal Migration Service).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to ask the question in the press many times: what will it actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for Russians and for the visitors themselves?
So, first of all - the representatives of the migration service answer - this will allow to reduce the number of people who suffer as a result of "slave labor."
Many people today talk about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the Chairman of the Board of FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be started before their departure.
Only the system of organized recruitment will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise in emigrants without a profession, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language, Sebelev says with conviction, the future migrant is condemned to clashes with dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "voucher" to terrible, cramped hostels, in which he and dozens of others like him will suffer for months without food and documents and work for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrant workers.
"In their homeland, they promise them one thing, but upon arrival, they cheat them, seize their passports, do not pay the promised wages," confirms Tolib Sharipov, head of the Tajik Labor Migration Agency.
Don't give up!
Moreover, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who intend to go to work in Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they want to get to, but they do not even have experience with this work.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as rather a misfortune: only very few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least an adequate basic education.
After all, their families also need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to be properly dressed, dressed and equipped for school.
As children reach a productive age, they have to go to work at the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of the language, it is difficult - they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
It is true that, with regard to the Law on Language Examinations, human rights defenders point to one important point.
The tests will only be carried out on migrants who have a legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't even take the exams, and they won't get any more official work.
In the meantime, most migrant workers are still living illegally in Russia.
"Welcome, or Unauthorized Entry Banned"
Many of the incoming workers claim that getting official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.
Legalization also costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police officers know that we basically have fake documents, without registration, and this leads to cases of blackmail.
"They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," - shared with journalists about his experience the citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chushkadamov.
"Come on, don't be greedy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the language law, it was found that not only the registration documents of migrants are fake.
FMS employees have already confiscated several fake certificates of passing the language exam.
Counterfeit documents are printed on an ordinary color printer.
Of course, they did not get the new owners for free: each of the migrants, in the hope of making it easier for them to pass the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times the amount of the official test: it will cost migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the near future is to secure the system against corruption so that workers cannot simply buy documents, which is what government officials and human rights defenders agree on.
So far, government authorities can promise foreign workers who failed the tests for the first time the necessary time to take a Russian language basics course.
Visitors who do not speak Russian are expected to work in areas where active interaction with people is not required.
The MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not take into account the illegal arms market
The share of crimes with the use of legally held weapons is very low
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to tighten the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
It is the reaction of government authorities to recent events: the impetus was the cases of shootings at weddings that did not involve victims, and the massacre prepared by the Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, which resulted in the deaths of seven people.
Police want to ban the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which a license to carry weapons can be obtained - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption Irina Jarovaja, who promised that the amendments to the law on weapons will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "tightening the screws".
An open letter appeared on the network, the authors of which - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demand the rejection of the "nonsensical tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminalist, told the BBC in an interview.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, in six months of 2012, 142 crimes were committed using firearms registered by the bodies of the Ministry of the Interior, while in the same period a total of 1,168,000 crimes were committed.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the tightening of legislation in the field of civilian weapons will not force the offender to switch to the "black" market.
According to them, at present, any weapon can be found in Moscow at a low price.
Currently, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
The "black" arms market is supplied by several channels.
There are five main channels, says retired colonel Victor Baranec, who worked for ten years in the workplaces of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of sites that accept weapon orders
The first of them - "army or military way", that is, a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were also stolen by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranec said.
Another type of "black weapons" are weapons stolen by criminals from the representatives of the security forces.
Baranec explains that this includes thefts from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from employees of law enforcement agencies.
Illegal "mainly" get on sale from military warehouses.
Explosions often occur in many military depots.
“It’s been proven that some of the fires were set deliberately – to cover up the shortage,” the former soldier said.
According to Barance, the arms manufacturers are also making their contribution.
“Currently, private arms companies are being created that are not competitive on the international market, and they are eliminating weapons that they supply to the black market, including Moscow,” the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and assault rifles come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes weapons are produced here in small-scale production, and a mafia was created that organized their continuous production," explains the former soldier.
Where'd the gun come from?
Experts have summed up what is the approximate share of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons on the "black" market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
Specialists analyzed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminological literature and data from public data portals focused on weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers say, come from military and executive bodies.
Half of all weapons found themselves on the black market "through the fault of officials whose work is linked to weapons," the report said.
According to the data available to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from armed conflicts, in 14% of cases weapons were stolen during their production, 5% is "black archaeology".
An arms dealer who asked us not to give his name is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations by black "archaeologists" have long since been bought by no one - they are simply too old.
Most often, he says, sellers go directly to military warehouses for new shipments.
Through the ensign, the interested party buys a unit, for example, a TT pistol.
You order a gun from him and he sells it to you over the fence.
"He takes it to the city and sells it there for 900 euros for a piece with two magazines," he says.
“The truth is that the police are well aware of the situation, and therefore whenever their plan to clarify the crimes starts to burn, they make a check purchase with illegal arms dealers,” he adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
Sellers and buyers most often find each other through their acquaintances.
I used to visit websites and blogs until a guy showed up and offered me the opportunity to switch to the "Trial" platform, where there would be a man who would take me to the "corner" where we would interact together.
I found out the price was right there.
Military correspondent Viktor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, says the sales assistant. - I have such a friend, but I do not fully trust him.
The sellers on the market are, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to arrange that the daughter lost a tooth."
And now I'm going to get there through a man I'm sure of.
He will also give them to me alone, because he knows that I will not give them to him.
Beginners look for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baranec tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing an article for publication on this topic.
The pattern, he said, has not changed.
They gave him a photo album that said "everything you ever thought of."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," the soldier recalls.
To the buyer, according to Baran<0xC4><0x9B>ce, they do not offer a rabbit in a sack - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, just don't buy - we go with the seller to the forest and build a target.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I make sure that the gun shoots well, we begin to act," the expert describes the procedure.
Tray on the sofa
Search engines on the Internet will bring you to websites and groups on "Vkontakte", where it is offered to buy weapons "for various purposes".
No documents or face-to-face meetings are required.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the advertising headline on the website "Buy a combat pistol or a machine gun."
On these pages, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And selling to minors?
"Of course, without a license," asks the user "Ivan" (the spelling is preserved).
"I will buy TT.Moscow" - briefly formulates the request "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently tore up a vast network of planted websites, and anyone who wants to buy a military weapon can rake it with a shovel.
People flock like hungry fish to bait and then mine for coal in Siberia.
Military reporter and senior military officer Viktor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c
I have heard of such schemes:websites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
"In response, the seller will send him a photo and a description with instructions on where the weapon is hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the NGO Right to Weapon.
Viktor Baranec confirms that after placing an order on the website, you can remain unarmed and find yourself behind bars.

MacArthur for $100
When you buy an illegal firearm, experts estimate that you will pay between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the NGO "Right to Arms", you will buy a Makarov pistol for $ 100 to $ 300.
You have to wait a month to one and a half months.
The weapon is shipped from the warehouses for long-term storage through the warehouses of the middle link.
According to the official statistical office, compared to the period January - October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia decreased by a total of 7%, and amounted to 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of clarified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers go on strike in the US
Up to a quarter of all American teenagers will work at McDonald’s.
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests in America against low wages in Walmart hypermarkets and restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as McDonald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into wave nine, or whether it is destined to disappear soon.
This action is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to the modest salary increases made to regular workers at Walmart and in fast food systems, the goal of the protest organizers is to achieve the creation of trade unions in them.
At present, this economic sector is practically untouched by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday," when an orgy of cheap sales hit America, gripping millions of residents and in some cases accompanied by brawls.
On this day, Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left its workplaces and demonstrated alongside trade unions and left-wing activists at multinational chain companies whose goods are targeted at lower and middle-class people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many low-wage employees at Walmart stores only shop at home at work.
The availability and range of products has made Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply partly because it pays very little to its employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic trucks or hand scanners.
Demonstrators on “Black Friday” demanded a pay rise and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the company rose sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart worker gets $9.5 an hour, but that doesn’t match the amount spent, employees say.
Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, say that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
This is an average of 1.1% more than the company spends on salaries now.
If Walmart shifts the wage increase entirely to consumers, each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more.
In one year, customers will spend approximately $12.39 more than they do today.
Walmart advocates point out that the protest took place in only nine countries, and the company should cause virtually no harm.
"Black Friday" in the company's stores lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during this time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items of goods per second.
In total, its coffers made nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
In an interview with the left-leaning Huffington Post, Dan Fogelman said that fewer than five Walmart employees had left their jobs, and that the protest was "another media sensation" organized by the unions.
"Unoccupied cash register!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their target was not Walmart stores (those in that progressive city are not very popular, and therefore are almost not here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s says it sells billions of servings, and then it doesn’t even pay you sick pay and doesn’t pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage for work in accordance with federal laws and the regulations of the state of New York is 7.25 dollars per hour.
Fast food restaurants are gradually increasing this salary, but only slightly, and on average, their regular workers in New York receive $8.90 per hour.
In this expensive city, no one has a lower salary.
I don't understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
Almost a quarter of American teenagers who work part-time behind the counter after school and live with their parents are employed at McDonald’s.
Few people see this as their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there for a long time.
At present, I constantly meet in an interview with McDonald's workers, who complain that they have to live on this money and sometimes even feed their children from it.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Protesters, who began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs at fast-food businesses start receiving at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be established in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing the formation of trade unions and punishing activists of the trade union movement with harassment and dismissal.
On the other hand, management rarely makes their lives easier.
However, the introduction of trade unions in fast food establishments is also difficult for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the extremely high turnover of employees.
Disagreement
On this day, noisy protests also took place in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the event was the midday rally at McDonald’s near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians spoke, especially city council member Jumaane Williams, who said, “McDonald says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn’t even pay you sick leave and doesn’t pay you properly for your honest work!”
Other prominent New York Democrats, such as the mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, said: “We need to stand together in support of the fast food workers so that they get the fair pay for their work and the economic prosperity every New Yorker deserves!”
As described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But it was attended by only a few hundred people, though not all of them were fast food workers, who employ tens of thousands in New York.
Whether this event will become the spark that ignites the flame of the mass movement is still unclear.
"So far, the brain has been able to deceive on average."
Among fans of modern virtual reality technologies is a popular theme of augmented reality; lately it means to perceive the world especially through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at its annual conference, Google presented a working model of this novelty, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also filed an application for the corresponding patent.
According to an interview with the head of the group of interactive 3D technologies at the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft, Sharam Izadi, glasses are already a thing of the past for scientists of this company.
They are attracted by the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
Please tell us what your research group is doing?
- We are dealing with human-machine interactions, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity is stuck in the phase of working with pixels on a flat screen, at most sometimes touching the screen with a finger.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without Kinect sensors, because for all is very interesting the option of control using gestures.
- What else is in the future?
“Although the Kinect system has taken the interaction to the physical level, there are still a lot of interactions taking place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives more data), but the output flow has not yet been separately.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on various technologies, including projective ones.
We need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
To do this, however, it is necessary to know not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more appropriate form.
And first of all - to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
It's a popular thing, but it's not overrated?
- Surely it can not be considered a panacea - the question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others around us about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about sweeping, just about such nimble, short ones.
The gesture would not be taken with the camera of the device, but with a bracelet that would track the movements of bones and muscles.
So far it is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
However, in general, the future has a mixed type of control, for example, gesture + voice.
- How's that?
How, for example, are you going to ask me to give you this can of soda?
Say it and show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it's gonna be very hard to tell.
- So you want to get the user to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at the moment?
- It's not necessary at all, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
This can be, for example, laser sensors that provide a fairly good depth resolution, this is very important.
- If you talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Is there not enough resolution, depth, or something else today?
- Basically, the current generation - this is what we can reflect on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 f/s.
But it's not just about the megapixels themselves, but as a matrix and depth.
In the current view of the matter, all the current technologies are insufficient for us - this adds to the work of algorithm designers.
So we have to keep in mind not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also the Z.
So the speed, the number of frames per second, is also very important.
Human motion is quite dynamic, and the current data flows of 30 frames per second are frankly a bit low, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our Redmond laboratory has made a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, while the current, mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands the extent to which it affects human-machine interaction.
For me, the equivalent of such a device would be very useful at work, I just do not need so many touches, but I need some pictures per second extra.
- And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
- Three "cameras" are now used in the Kinect system, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera - this is actually a common sensor of the visible band.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
More cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or make it worse, because it would increase the necessary volume of calculations carried out.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog Kinect system, toy with the curvature of the camera location and see how this helps in determining the three-dimensional position.
As far as I remember, Microsoft (unlike Google) did not publicly present its glasses.
Don’t you think that when it comes to everyday use of augmented reality technology with special glasses, it is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking and constantly holding the smatphone in raised hands is not very convenient, but I think: the most powerful option would be a "portable" form of augmentation of reality, where it would be possible to switch from glasses to a smartphone, a projection display and more around the globe at any time based on the cloud platform.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, this is their strength (private things only you see), and at the same time also weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects simultaneously with other people.
Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to the ordinary mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no tactile response!
The hands can't feel anything!
What answers is your group preparing for this challenge?
In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the addition of tactile sensations could easily become the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - the use of the second hand as a certain kind of basis for imaging.
It records compression in an excellent way!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at adding palpability to these "images in the air" - for example, the interference of several directional ultrasound beams at a defined point where the finger is located, causes a tactile sensation, but it is still very weak - as if you were blowing on your fingertips.
There is also a wrist bracelet that affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you ever tried to fool the brain?
To make him think he feels what he seems to feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that yet.
Here comes another challenge that will be fought for a long time - how to get a person who is physically in a very cramped space to believe that he is walking in an open, practically endless space - we are also working on the concept of cross-country tracks (not at all like in clubs), moving platforms and also huge balls.
If deception of the brain becomes a goal, then the work is for many years to come.
That’s what makes working on virtual reality so appealing to researchers – a lot of things are in their infancy.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "St. Petersburg avant-garde", dedicated to the citizens who are at the forefront, are the avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already significant figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often find recognition in Europe, without achieving all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is dressed all in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here in fashionable pubs and at openings.
Cyril Miller’s paintings, wherever they are exhibited, always attract crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical St. Petersburg storytellers, creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - this is a striking man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s and early 90s.
In addition to being a city person, his appearance on the streets evokes a smile on the face of citizens, increases the mood of everyone.
He recently picked up a bottle and became a St. Petersburg bottle-maker, having matured into this complex role with his whole bohemian life, philosophy and image.
Cyril, why are you walking around the city in red and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose red as a designer dealing with appearance and image.
In this world, red represents a compromise between the artist, the imagemaker and the public.
Although it is generally true that everything that is just a little different from gray, awakens aggressiveness and awakens bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at establishing a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is, above all, an invitation to debate.
And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in the House of Culture in Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I understand what my path is.
Then the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and I could not understand the new, free types of artists.
I befriended the New Wave artists, the post-Gazonians, who led us to Pushkinskaya 10, and there were no other waves.
It attracts me to theatre, dress, music, to all genres except the word.
- And it all came together in your art clinic ... - It was important for me to find myself in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best forces of creativity should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a place on Pushkinskaya 10, and there even before the reconstruction there was a music and art club, a bohemian club, the home of the St. Petersburg bohemians.
There were born many:NOM, Tequila Jazz, do not forget how the Cord was brought with the project "Ear of Van Gogh".
String and his friends sang under the plywood of light songs, dressed in tight-fitting leotards, in the middle among them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band began to play live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg ran many programs of the Hali-Galivan times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, which started his great career, basic education and training he received from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - it's a reverb Art Clinic.
This is where our permanent and working guests have gone.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, the survey was organized in the press, a special prize was "People in our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was nominated, thus ending my peak.
In the new times, according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In the present years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are distinctive in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are hits in which topicality and insight are vividly captured.
I will have a program exhibition "Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, today to be so is painful and terrible.
But in clowns, everything is erased, tragedy is filmed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world through totalitarian disguise in the order.
Today, people meet by clothes, they focus on external mechanics, not on the inner person.
Or maybe you can't shake his hand and spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by changing clothes.
- We saw you recently as a city bottler. - A cultural city should have a hero like that.
And who would it be if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- At present, commercial, applied art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There is a breakdown of cultures.
In the past, people used to meet in groups, bohemians loved one thing, simple other people.
Today everything has broken down into micro-societies, today it is very difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Today you need to think about who you will like.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And several thousand spectators will come to Mikhailov's Stas!
It's where the fans come in. It's where the sexual social sphere gets involved.
And 300 people come to the cultural land and 10,000 don't come, and the result is less management, less money, everything goes down.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one deceives them and does not violate what is experienced.
When I was young, I used to paint pictures that one collector had on the wall with Falk and Larionov.
I started with images that people usually end up with.
Nowadays, people often confuse concepts.
They say: Spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, it is from elsewhere.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejected money for drawing pictures.
I am for that culture.
Cyril, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a concept: the agent through culture.
However, not all of them can deal with culture.
It was not so in all the times of the proper tsars, the tsars may not have understood the culture very much, but they understood that it was necessary to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
Here in St. Petersburg we have people who could be experts, but they are stuck somewhere in the corner, because we need great experts who will properly appreciate these experts and lead them on the right path.
Today, taste buds are thriving.
The same Erarta, but they differ in that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think St. Petersburg is?
- St. Petersburg - this is not the capital of culture, in Moscow there is much more culture, there is the right soil.
And at our peril, art thrives miserably.
We need cultural land, but there are more writers than readers here today, which is wrong.
In Europe, there are a lot of people who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
In our country, such a layer is only weak.
We need art to become a fashion item, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented with the funds of the St. Petersburg grant
Giving birth in space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earthlings on board set out on a journey, looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the main question arises: how to keep your family in weightless conditions or on a given alternate planet?
I don't think it's a big choice.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be assimilated, even if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Surdin, a senior researcher at the P. K. Sternberg State Astronomical Institute (SAIS).
While there are better conditions for life on Mars, temperatures on the surface of Venus reach 500 degrees Celsius.
It is possible to live there only at a great height or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
To solve the issues of reproduction in the universe began scientists with flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their earthly relatives.
Then the insects were carried out into orbit - a very small fruit fly Drosophila.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to test how an embryo develops in a weightless state.
At the exit we get an absolutely normal bird.
But then the problems start.
"There is a problem with the fact that this bird has to find support, it has to stand on its own feet and start moving," says Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN.
If they do not find support, the birds fall chaotically and make moorings.
After 10 hours, the newly hatched birds were completely destroyed by instinct.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was, in four days, they just died.
"We let the birds hatch twice, but then we refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," says the failure of the experiment with chickens in space Vladimir Sychev.
The last "miniarch" with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
Experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
But in the biosatellite "Bion" there will be only beings of one sex.
There was an experiment with rats that were already pregnant.
In fact, they didn't find anything supernatural.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - this is a unique experiment and such experiments need to be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on the ground, the space rats were born offspring.
However, to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet succeeded.
It's a difficult task.
Animals, when losing their usual environment, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Humans, unlike animals, can do it.
Homo sapiens dominates abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
Women have been in space for 50 years.
Tereshkova was the greatest danger.
The most precious thing that humanity has is a woman’s body.
Our Seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could tell if it would survive a flight into space.
Will she be able to give birth to a child after such a flight?
"No one has answered this question yet," said Vachtang Va<0xC4><0x8D>nadze, a veteran of the rocket and space industry.
In June 1964, more than a year after the space flight, the first woman-cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child was also the cosmonaut Andrian Nikolayev.
In 1988, the son of the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savická was born, who visited the orbit twice and who also worked in open space.
But the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts, who after many years were born and grow healthy offspring.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even in orbital flights," says cosmonaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
Yet humanity must inevitably seek new avenues in the fields of biotechnology, radiation protection, and artificial gravity.
The CPK hydro-laboratory is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, under conditions of zero gravity, astronauts learn the habits needed to work in open space.
Water imitates a state of weightlessness.
Although for adults, water is a comfortable, but in a way strange environment, for young children it is a natural element.
Little ichthyanders seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is on average 9 months in the mother's amniotic fluid and that it is then easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first bath, only 2 weeks will pass.
"That's very little to make a child forget something," says newborn swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short - if for a newborn baby the state of weightlessness is a more natural state, then for women the inevitable gravity, an attractive force, is more natural.
In a state of weightlessness, the abdominal muscles, pelvic muscles deteriorate very quickly, the body's ability to expel the fetus decreases.
We can leave this aside if the stimulators of muscle activity during childbirth will work.
After all, it is possible that the birth took place in a special chamber in which the mother's organism expels the fetus.
"What's next?" asks Valery Polyakov, asking difficult questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the organism is not affected by the earth’s attraction, it cannot properly form a skeleton or a system of muscles.
A newborn in orbit can not be dressed as an adult in a special suit with a load in which he could train.
He will simply be deprived of what he absolutely needs for his development.
"If we go with you to an experiment that allows the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring a disabled person to Earth who will be completely unadapted to the local environment," Igor Pestov, head of the Bioethics Commission of IBMP RAN, predicts.
So the birth of children in space today is just a theoretical question.
But one day the time will come when it will become a reality and when the Earthlings will set out in their ships on a distant planet, which will become the home of their descendants born in space.
Head of SAO: Control of the schwarcsystem failed through the fault of politicians
The Czech Republic has good controllers and quality legislation in connection with public procurement, but it is limping in its application.
In an interview with Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, the vice president of the Supreme Audit Office, Miloslav Kala, said this.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - this is what is missing in our country in my opinion," Kala comments on the current situation.
Similar conclusions are also suggested by the joint inspection of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of incorrect practice, he cites Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as' approach to the so-called "<0xC5><0xA1>varcsystem".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS will not harass the entrepreneur with its controls - is it prohibited or allowed?
"After all, the law must be set in some way, and if it prohibits something, then even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activities of the office, which is obliged to go to control and enforce obligations," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Control Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which the legislation related to public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly was it about?
This is a parallel check that we started about two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation regulates how public contracts are to be dealt with, followed by individual national legislations and then by practice itself.
We put all this together, and even though the control is not yet complete, we found very interesting differences - in general, the legislation in our country is perhaps even "stricter and more perfect", but the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
Thus, it is confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to devote oneself to the application of the law itself.
What can this project do for you, what does it do for you?
It is precisely such joint control that could help us to stop making efforts to tighten the laws, reduce and improve the limits, when this does not have such a positive impact.
Profitability means getting the corresponding thing at a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price, in order to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But by reducing the limit of orders, we do not necessarily achieve this.
Perhaps the system will be overwhelmed by so much "paper" that those who want to look for holes in the system will draw on it much easier than if the limit remained higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with translating public procurement legislation into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is the office similar to our SAO, or is it set up differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, just as the SAO operates the Bundesrechnungshof there, which is organised in a similar way to us, it also has a college, only it is formed in a slightly different way, but in principle both authorities are acting in a similar way.
The powers are also to some extent similar, but because Germany has a federal structure, so does these courts of auditors at the level of the individual federal states - in this the system is slightly different from ours.
BRH can control only federal money, represented by state funds.
Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities in our country, are controlled there from the level of the federal accounting courts.
As for the legislation there, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare it without specific data, however, in some respects Germany is usually referred to as a model, but it cannot be said for sure that it is better in everything.
Is it because they have better controllers?
Of course not, but again, I don’t like comparisons.
But it must be said that even the countries that we see as role models are facing a whole host of problems.
Otherwise, it would be useless for them to cooperate with our office, wouldn't it?
As far as the domestic legislation is concerned, what did the amendment to the Public Procurement Act mean for your office, are its effects already being manifested in any way?
Since the validity period of this amendment is relatively short, it is not yet manifested in our control actions.
Since we do ex-post checks, it is necessary to count on a certain delay.
So far, we are only observing this in the process of preparing future controls - we have launched our new tool 'risk detection of inefficiencies', through which we have driven almost 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed them - there, of course, these changes will manifest themselves, because the limits will change, the conditions of some types of tendering will adjust, and so on.
Do you consider the approval of this law to be a benefit or a further burden on the system of bureaucracy?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise here is that the rules will be "tightened" and it will not be possible to comply with them.
Already during the operation of the previous rules, the audited persons are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the regional council) to the fact that any failure to comply with the law on public procurement means a violation of budgetary discipline.
Is it worth it to tighten the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, and not punish those who commit formal misconduct that has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only put more pressure on the bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this?
Let's see where the road doesn't lead.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS will not bother entrepreneurs with checks of the so-called "Swarcsystem" - and what does this mean?
Is the Swarcsystem Prohibited or Allowed?
After all, the law must be somehow set up, and if it prohibits something, then even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activity of the office, which is obliged to go to control and enforce duties.
He can say, "We're going to change the law and allow it," but he can't say we're going to do as nothing.
In the law on public procurement, there are quite strict rules on how what should be formally implemented - which is correct in order to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - this is what is lacking in our country in my opinion.
Roads are frozen in places, but mostly driveable
In several places in the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowy.
Most of the time, however, the roads are rickety, somewhere with increased caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary Region this morning the roads were drivable, but in some places frozen and also snowy.
The temperature has dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but it is expected to warm slightly during the day.
The snow in the region has stopped and there is only a weak layer in the lowlands.
However, there is about 30 centimeters of snow on the ridges of the Ore Mountains.
There was also lower visibility due to fog, according to data from the regional road traffic control.
The R6 expressways and first-class communication are now freely accessible in the region.
Caution, however, is in place, for example, on some bridges, where the surface can be frosty and slippery.
All second and third class roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
In some areas, however, there are still remnants of frozen and snow-covered areas.
Especially in higher positions, it is necessary to pay increased attention to driving.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové Region
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a threat of frost, in higher positions and in the mountains there may be a layer of snow on the roads, the Directorate of Roads and Motorways informs on its website.
Motorists warn the driver against frost, it can be formed especially in higher positions of the Pardubice region.
Náled<0xC3><0xAD> may be in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ky, Svitav or Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>to, especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
The roads I/43 and I/34 near Svitav are chemically treated.
Snow is especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Eagle Mountains.
The snow cover is in the highest positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia today it is mostly clear and partly cloudy with no precipitation.
Temperatures usually range between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, a weak wind blows.
Plze<0xC5><0x88> Region
The roads in the Plze<0xC5><0x88> Region are drivable this morning, but in some places it is necessary to adjust the weather with increased caution and driving.
It is frosty in the morning, temperatures range between three to nine degrees below the freezing point.
After the previous snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communications may be frozen.
The driver must also count on fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is according to the information of the regional road dispatcher.
The D5 motorway is almost unlimited, but increased caution is recommended by road administrators between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In the southern Plze<0xC5><0x88> and Tachov regions, however, there may be frozen sections.
Communications of the second and third classes are wet, and also in this case, a warning applies to frozen sections.
Drivers should be especially careful on less frequented roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava region.
Olomouck<0xC3><0xBD> kraj
Today, snowflakes on the road must be counted on drivers heading to the highest places of the Olomouc region.
After the chemical spill, it remained on <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo and on the road in the direction of the Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>.
The motorists were driven into the terrain by snow at night, about three centimeters snowed in <0xC5><0xA0>umperk, according to the road managers.
In other parts of the region, the roads are mostly unobstructed.
"In the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk region, the remains of snow lie in the highest positions.
Drivers have to count on snow on <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorsk<0xC3><0xBD> sedlo in the direction of Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k," the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk Road Administration dispatcher told CTK today.
Their colleagues in Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k were also going into the field at night, the roads up to the highest positions are now, according to them, bare and wet after chemical treatment.
In Olomouc, the roads are passable without restrictions, but in <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk, drivers should be careful in forest sections where the roads remain wet.
<0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem Region, Liberec Region
A number of hard-to-reach places were reported this morning by roadmen in northern Bohemia.
In addition to several places with attacked snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem is also closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures are kept even in lower positions below zero, so the ice and snow seem to last on the roads.In the lowlands, especially south-east of the Czech Central Highlands, on the contrary, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
Operational complications have not yet been reported.
The occurrence of the glacier is reported by motorists, especially from the vicinity of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to meteorologists, the conditions were ideal for her at night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night clear and frosty.
From the main routes, adverse conditions are also reported on the I/13 road on the border of the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem Region and the Liberec Region.
The closure from Telnice to Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice was forced by bent branches of trees that were bent down to the road under a layer of snow.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: We want to accumulate positive energy at concerts
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other alarmist messages that we humans love to catch.
Together with the band The Tap Tap, we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you will organize a completely unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce it to your readers?
This is a national benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21 at 11:10 am.
The day before, on December 20, at 9 pm, 3 concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is in the time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was probably my idea, then we invented everything together with our artist Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state in which we will one day pass this world on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of items of shoes, t-shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world, by purchasing them on www.e-tap.cz, people can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap, along with other artists, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The end of the world canceled".
She is already very popular on YouTube, will she be heard at these benefit concerts?
Of course, and in the end, if we succeed and the end of the world does not come...
It will be sung by all the performers at all three concerts simultaneously.
The anthems will also be combined in a unique live broadcast on Czech Television.
The lyrics to this song were written and the main role of Jesus in the clip is played by Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Hanák, also sung by Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, given that we organize a lot of benefit events and concerts...
We are actively involved in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in working with us and having fun.
What will the profits from concerts against the end of the world be?
For the equipment of the barrier-free educational center Studeo, which we have been implementing for the sixth year now with the Tap civic association in the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ek Institute.
The students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute schools are regularly visited by lecturers and are engaged in activities that they enjoy and are interested in.
The students themselves do not have the means to pass themselves off as lecturers, so we try to enable them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, a separate building will be built in the future, to which we will move with this project.
Several musical groups and performers will perform at each concert.
How did you choose them?
We tried to put together a program that will appeal to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD> will perform in Prague.
Full details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bombing" events in the future?
In May, we will perform at the Prague Spring for the first time, so we will definitely prepare an interesting program with interesting guests here.
Next year we would also like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we are in the USA, would like to link it with the performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalistic, for example, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it looks at first glance.
We have five members in an electric wheelchair, their trolleys have to travel in the luggage compartment, then of course we carry a large amount of cargo and boxes with tools...
However, so far it has always been done without problems, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were perfectly prepared for us, I was surprised how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was without problems.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare how the individual differs in disability, public access to the disabled, and the like.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than in our country, we have just witnessed in Russia that everything is still in its very beginnings in the East.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is very barrier, here it is still unusual for a person in an electric wheelchair to move himself in the city center.
There is no such thing as a wheelchair in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, civic associations are already being formed there, which are trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And what, on the contrary, do we still have to catch up with more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still behind on...
However, it is important to note that the improvement and improvement of the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid it is quite common that even people with severe disabilities can move independently in public, go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, on the contrary, we are a little ahead with The Tap Tap!
Respecting the public or being barrier-free is one thing, but it is only when we are important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers that things really begin to change.
So far, these are unique cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but let’s go back a few years, what made you start it in 1998?
I started as an educator at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I had many young people around me who were interested in doing something.
And since I am a musician myself, I play the saxophone, among other things, so I founded an interesting music club together with my colleague.
And over time, as our presenter Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, it got a little out of hand (laughs).
But the popularity has only come in recent years, am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we started to connect with well-known singers and also actively work on the promotion of the band.
We realized that the work that is not seen, in fact, as if it did not exist.
Thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can also afford quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was your goal to get The Tap Tap this high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Showbusiness is crowded with things where one imitates the other.
It is logical in a way, everything new is taken with care and it takes a long time.
There are very few things that are unique, but I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time, of course, is regret, this is natural...
But this regret is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering from all the abandoned beings that we have to regret.
These are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, provided that they have the necessary means to do so.
I'm saying that when something succeeds for people with disabilities, it's not just a shift for them, it's a shift for society as a whole.
Has this success also been helped by the fact that you are a strict boss, as many people have labeled you?
When we want to do quality work, we must be uncompromising in many things and require a certain discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and head in the clouds, and when they find that they have to go to rehearsals twice a week, come to the preparation and spend a lot of time on the road to concerts, the enthusiasm quickly leaves them.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there at the beginning of the year?
Only one Lady Angelovich.
We are an open group, people leave and come, this cannot be prevented.
He who has the will and the taste always has the door open for us.
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21:00
The Incheba Arena, Brno Fléda and Ostrava Plynoj will be held in Prague with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
At the end of the evening, all three cities will be connected by telebridges with a joint singing of the song of the band The Tap Tap "The End of the World Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the equipment of the multifunctional barrier-free educational center STUDIO at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ek Institute in Prague in the amount of CZK 25 million.
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 years old have free tickets in the pre-sale Bohemianticket
Poland and space.
Last week, at the meeting of the ministers of the European Space Agency countries, Poland was accepted as the 20th member of the European Space Agency, as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and over the years has participated in a number of projects of the Agency.
However, Poland’s journey into space began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts had devoted themselves to space flights before World War II; but they did not always meet with understanding.
I will recall, for example, a lecture by A. Sternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which, on December 6, 1933, presented ideas from his pioneering work The Entrance to Cosmonautics.
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience cold, and after years Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld was awarded the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize for his entry into space science in France.
Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and has written a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-famous promoter of cosmonautics, and his contribution was also appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the Moon was named after him.
As early as 1925, a railway track was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and the details of the project are not known.
It is not clear whether the missile was to be used to launch the dreadnought or to brake it.
Information about this dresiny is known only from the period press.
In 1933, the Polish artillery began to engage with missiles.
The research was carried out by the Cell of Armament Technology in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfek and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzycki.
From the preserved materials it is clear that the research has reached the stage of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the research was interrupted.
In 1937, a proposal for a photoelectric fighter rocket appeared in the professional press, which was designed by an engineer Rohozinski, and the following year the work Rocket - Air Torpedo and Air Bomb by Leliwa-Krzywoblocky was published.
Both projects were intended for the military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) devoted all projects of military use of rocket technology to which all work was coordinated.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, its activities ended with the outbreak of war.
Other works devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polish Astronautical Society).
For the first time, there is a mention of the company in the November 1954 issue of the magazine Problems, which contains four more comprehensive articles on astronautics.
In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicz, it is proposed to create a company that will deal with cosmonautics.
Projects of artificial satellites were already underway at that time, and it was clear that space research was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) has been trying to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951), and already in the autumn, PTA became a full member.
The following year, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), the first chairman of the PTA, became vice-chairman of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been heavily involved in the development of the highly successful RM meteorological rocket (Meteorological Rocket), which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with an access of 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket began in the Bled Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of development was to be capable of real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was to have access to up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high-altitude wind.
However, in 1962, further development was suspended.
The successor to the first RM rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, developed from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (marked Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed in the size of the space for scientific instruments.
In the Meteor-1A rocket was available space with a volume of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B with a volume of 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C with a volume of 0.62 liters.
The maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Institute of Aviation, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a launch weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Subsequently, versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is necessary to mention the entry of Poland into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
Poland was also involved in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites as part of the Intercosmos program, and in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Remek.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a lively public debate.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in the globalized world are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in permanent conflict with each other.
The reason is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, along with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to significant differences in the price of labor, (wages) price tensions occur.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer tries to compete with imports of cheap goods by "undercutting" the price of a competitor in order to take a larger share of the market and thus increase its own profits.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to transfer production abroad, or to buy cheaply there, or to disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where labor prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment it produces, the social expenditure of the state necessarily increases.
The whole situation is amplified by the absolute reluctance of the masters of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social social damage they have caused in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistical data.
The ruthless practices of private capital create a situation in individual economies in which the governments of individual countries are forced to enter into competition with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give private capital a chance to its own population regardless of social decline.
This is mainly reflected in the changes to the current laws.
The aim is to economically force its own population to accept the price diktat of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This is done, on the one hand, by a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, and, on the other hand, by restricting the rights of employees in the field of labour law.
The result is growing poverty, along with increasing disparities between the poor and the rich.
For many years now, there have been public food outlets in Germany for the poor, who cannot afford their own work.
The number of these people is already in the millions.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for well-employed people to be paid such a wage that the state has to pay them to the subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal was also reported in the case of auxiliary employees of the Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation where people, under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in social standards, are forced to either emigrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or to live on the fringes of society in the hope that private investment capital may one day come to the country.
The question is, where does it come from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, or a Turk, a Moroccan, or an Egyptian, or an African still work for a fraction of the European wage.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media obnoxiously claim that the state cannot participate in capital on its own economy, that a managed economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital strongly insists that the state must not intervene in the economy through management interventions.
Then one has to ask whether private capital does not influence, in fact, now governs politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here's the clear answer, yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually all-powerful and omnipresent lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifested in the field of corruption, the provision of mutual benefits, legislation, where practically everything is punishable, but nothing is criminal.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the situation is such that the state ministries, due to lack of funds, entrust the drafting of laws to private law firms, which are often associated with industry.
These bills are then approved in the Bundestag.
All power in this way does not come from the people as proclaimed by Western-style constitutions, but from financially strong groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberal democracies are now rapidly getting into the situation described by Appianos in his Crisis of the Roman Republic under Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long been in complete disarray and the authorities have occupied themselves with violence.
For bribes, illegal gain of favor and with the help of stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption were rampant, and the people went to the polls with a pre-sold vote" ... "characteristic people did not apply for office at all, so one day as a result of this disruption was to stand without consuls for eight months ... "..The App really began to talk about the fact that the only remedy in a bad situation is self-government and that it is necessary to control it.
As in ancient times, modern society is based on a ruthless preference for self-interest, regardless of the interests of society as a whole.
By its very nature, private capital is no longer able to understand and apply the benefits of society as a whole.
The result now, as then, is an unprecedented decadence of elites without any attempt at reform of a deeper nature.
The causality of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the ruthless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the demise of these systems in favor of liberal-type democracy can be considered a certain break with the expectation of the next round.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today’s elites completely ignore in the future the possible hundreds of thousands of deaths, humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know them from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of competition at both international and European level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the capital participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: The Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing comes out of violence and nothing can ever come out of it" Sting in Fragile's song whose main refrain is "Let's not forget how fragile we are"
“If my sons did not want war, there would be no war.” – Gutel Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, 1849
After the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there has been, as always, a lot of reaction.
Some stand for Israel, argue for its right to self-defense, and the Palestinians fit the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, argue for the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide of the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel fit the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is the culprit in the periodically recurring waves of killings and who are the victims, after all, today’s residents of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of the violence.
My point is to offer readers a view behind the curtain, a view of who has served primarily the 95-year-long tension (counted since the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of Middle Eastern land.
Some of my reflections are supported by available historical facts, some of them are derived from my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost the history of the struggle for power.
In each epoch we can find one Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it was always these personalities who completely autonomously guided their steps or whether behind their throne was someone who directed their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live at a time when the world’s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power that comes from it could not have taken place in the lifetime of one generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that might consider itself the head of an octopus (if anyone still stands above them I don’t know, but I don’t rule it out) – the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) was bought as early as the 1890s to stop linking their name to the highly criminal acts they were behind and which have always meant the consolidation of power, the multiplication of wealth, or both.
They have major stakes in almost all of the world’s central banks and against countries where the stakes in the central bank are not being waged or preparing wars (before the invasion of Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq, there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi, only four remained, but in the meantime Russia subordinated the central bank to the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to defy this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the Rothschild Bank of America, began to issue his own (understand government) money during the Civil War, and was assassinated in 1865 in a theater.
JFK began to issue its own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for unleashing a major economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led, between 1859 and 1871, to the formulation of a plan for three world wars by a mason of the highest, the 33rd degree of initiation by Albert Pike.
The first war was to eliminate the great monarchical state units in Europe, the second was to eliminate the colonial dominions of Great Britain in particular, and the third was to lead to the reduction of the world population somewhere between 0.5 and 1 billion people (such a number of slaves for their convenience and luxury is enough and do not consume so many resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a foreground for such a solution) and the final assumption of absolute power.
The method by which a group of the richest families, led by the Rothschilds, work is to provoke a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chaos - order out of chaos).
However, these solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed so that crises like the one they caused in 1907 do not happen again).
So, after they succeeded in assassinating the Habsburg heir to Ferdinand’s throne in Sarajevo and starting World War I, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by launching the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended in a sudden, militarily and economically unjustified capitulation of Germany (there was no longer any need for war to destroy tsarist Russia) and the subsequent fragmentation of the Central European power, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers allowed politicians to create a latent conflict situation by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, thereby creating the precondition for radicalization of the impoverished masses, and then they only had to push the Germans strong enough, the culprits marking and simple solutions offering the Leader, and then the creation of a powerful Czech nation.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds instigated the establishment of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferentially in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created the precondition for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, whether Hitler broke off from the chain on which the international bankers had originally held him, or whether all he had planned to do was hard to estimate, in any case the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the precondition for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and just as war reparations were paid to Germany for World War II, a third outbreak of war was created by the declaration of the State of Israel.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish people, as in the latter, will be the victims in the front line of the struggle, now together with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country, but also internationally (just consider how sharply people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in an endless chain of violence, when at the beginning of everything was the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
Here, it is necessary to distinguish the common people of Israel from their leaders, because, like in our country, international bankers are pushing people to choose their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of a fascist, loyal to the international bankers, a politician who does everything to start a war with Iran, which, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatens to turn the control of the IR into a global conflict.
David Rockefeller once said, “All we need is a general crisis, and the people will agree to a new world order.”
The new world order in their image is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newborn is implanted at birth with a chip that makes him a totally controlled being.
"And he compels all small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to have on their right hands or on their foreheads a mark, that they may not buy or sell, whosoever is not marked by the name of the beast or by the number of his name.
This is to be understood: whoever has sense, let him add the numbers of the beast.
It is the number of a man, and it is the number of six hundred and sixty-six."
Argo: When it's worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist students seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the ousted Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled to the United States after the revolution, which had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the US administration, the situation did not offer a positive starting point - to throw the Shah overboard could not afford, because it would fundamentally threaten the confidence of allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, was not achieved.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later deepened by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were eventually released after 444 days, after negotiations were brokered by the Algerian government.
Their fate at home has sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's loss to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
Directed by Ben Affleck, Argo chronicles one episode of the story that brought America a small victory.
Just before the occupation of the embassy, six employees fled from it.
After a difficult period, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helped by an extravagant cover story - they left for Canadian passports as members of the film crew, which in the country was inspecting the location for the filming of a sci-fi movie.
Combination of genres
The plan, devised by "exfiltration" expert Tony Mendez, also called for Hollywood's cooperation.
In order for the legend to be credible, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.
Affleck’s film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time the so-called "caper movie", the story of a successful piece, a prank - an example can be a series of Danny's partners.
The film thus alternates moods - on the one hand documentary sequences from Tehran (the title sequence shows iconic period photographs of events and the way in which the same situations were presented in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, lightened passages from Hollywood, reconciled with irony and slight exaggeration.
And then there's scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions -- men in suits discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, in the corridors of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
The derided actor became a respected director and even his acting ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after the dark crime drama Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it is the first Affleck film that does not take place in the director’s home city of Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that raised the director’s older films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time conveys the emotion of confusion and unpredictability that occur when history suddenly moves somewhere.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (a fake staff in a Tehran bazaar).
Too many things in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not offer much in the cinematic sense of the exciting scenes.
Quite successfully working with this little, sometimes he comes up with something to the reality - everything does not work out so elegantly there (a scene in which the impending crisis at the Tehran airport turns away a phone call in America and the chase after the runway seems quite drawn to the hair).
The weakness of Arga, however, is the dispersion resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood collaborators, but their characters would deserve more space and are not the only ones in the film.
Affleck’s film loses a bit of a dramatic turn, it is a film that can be watched with a slight interest, appreciate the realization and retro style that evokes the thrillers of the 70s.
But it's hard to pull off.
As a reminder of a still-living history, and a testament to how exaggerated the notions of omnipotent and omniscient secret services are, but enough.
Rules for inflatable balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually publishes a survey on the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd regulations or ideas from the EU workshop".
"We were led to this by the last event, when the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify the rates of insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, women have been favored in life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by people by the end of this year.
The vote itself will then take place until the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
Controversial EU regulations include mandatory incorporation of biocomponents into fuels, which is harmful to nature, a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance, or a directive on the size of chicken cages, which has made eggs significantly more expensive this year.
Earlier, criticism was also faced by the de facto ban on the use of the term butter spread or the exclusion of classic light bulbs from sale.
High-quality bananas should be 14 centimeters
The EU apparatus often makes decisions under the pressure of one or another commercial or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by a state or a group of states (so the Czech Republic is now also enforcing the demands of its banks with the threat of a veto).
Interests of the lobby were also due to the fact that, for example, bananas of the highest quality had to reach a length of at least 14 cm in the Union and were not allowed to show "anomalous curvature".
In doing so, the European Commission has defended itself by merely harmonising the hitherto divergent national standards that have complicated trade.
Fruit and vegetable standards have already been softened by the EU, despite the resistance of some countries, pointing out that existing directives lead to food waste.
Last year’s EU regulation may also be a candidate to win the poll, according to which it is mandatory for inflatable balloons sold to be notified that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has cited U.S. research showing that balloons between toys are the leading cause of child deaths from suffocation.
A similar restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age when blowing into pilgrimage stalls.
Curious ideas are born at home
The rule concerning the European officials themselves is also quite absurd - anyone who has an official function in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, and must instead speak about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire nominated to the survey, in addition to some of the above absurdities, the EU regulations on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set the maximum quantities of food stocks that could have been on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the prescribed volumes for canned mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having the sea, and the idea of granting subsidies on request for obtaining a subsidy.
However, these ideas did not originate in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are handicapped by the fact that we do not have the sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," said Jaroslav Palas, the then Minister of Agriculture (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he said that a lot of grain was produced in our country and as a result of so-called intervention purchases, the state should have full warehouses, which it had to export.
The EU, according to Palas, should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros for the Czech Republic’s continued access to ports.
The European Commission finally welcomed the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy for obtaining the subsidy was offered to the municipalities by the Ministry for Regional Development managed by Minister Pavel Nemec (US-DEU), specifically they were supposed to write a request for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are an exception
Although the regulations are easily criticized in the Member States, the EU's efforts to regulate and, at the same time, to operate and develop the whole Union more effectively deserve more recognition, according to a number of experts.
A more serious problem, according to experts, is, for example, the use of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which were forced upon themselves by the Member States during the budget negotiations.
The emotion among the Czechs is also aroused by the fact that, like other countries of the Union, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to a specific designation of its traditional products, and it will not always succeed in this match.
After a six-year struggle with the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs defended the designation of Olomouc curds, but the domestic rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century in our country, had to be renamed by our producers to the local brand.
The naming of rum can only be carried by products from cane distillate, and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of EU registered products in the company of world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from German L<0xC3><0xBC>beck or Parma hams, for example, Karlovy Vary biscuits, Pogorelicky and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88> carp and <0xC5><0xBD>atec hops have already been included.
Pardubice gingerbread and mustard pipes can also be a trademark of the EU.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how does one think of running for president?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If it works in our country, I'm not running anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the country being stolen over the last 20 years, thieves running around, people being taxed and the retirement age being raised.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I'm already 40 and an independent non-partisan, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You made it to the Senate, but you soon set out for the Castle.
Do you turn your back on the people who elected you?
All this time I've said that I'd go to the battle for the Castle according to the results of the Senate elections.
I later clarified that if I were elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not a function, a function is a tool to make my vision come true.
That is why I need as much influence and as strong a mandate as possible.
The problem, however, is not only that we, as a nation, swear in a pub and on television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to try to change.
Added to this is the media, which defames people and confuses the freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.
For example, it was claimed that I bribed a journalist or that I was an advisor to Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
You set out to fight for the Castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians and the return of property confessions over twenty million.
To do that, you have to change the law.
But as president, you don't have that kind of authority, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this?
When, as a citizen, I lobbied for free trade to become a guide, I succeeded.
The problem is politics - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or right, they are deliberately rejected, and this delays the citizens.
As an independent non-party, I have a much greater potential to get support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without party casketing and dogma, I can take something that is best for our country, from each side, and apply it.
Do you see yourself as a leftist or a rightist?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people rank me rather to the left.
It doesn’t matter if it’s a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
I don’t care if someone is on the left or the right, but I want to bring people together.
I will always support any public good solution, even if it is proposed by the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or ODS, and I will also oppose a bad idea.
It’s funny when people say you’re a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about are already working in the world, or have been talked about by prominent experts.
But without the support of parliament, you'll only have passwords left.
You will not be able to do this in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will be able to enforce, for example, criminal and material liability?
I don't have a choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side to enforce it.
If I were to be elected president, there would be no problem in holding a live TV broadcast where I would ask the chairmen of the parliamentary parties to legislate material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they might have to tell you why they don't want it.
When there is a strong personality that will name the villains, you can push on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was due to public pressure.
I'm an amateur, I'm not a genius, I'm not an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I try to find allies.
I have just started in politics and I will try to get majority support for my programme.
I'm trying to move things around on my own if I can't do it, and in six years, I'll be done and I'll be back in the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura is supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I will not do anything in one person, so I went around a number of well-known people to see if they would also run for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, who refused because of the amount of work.
So at least I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who uncovered fraud with light fuel oils.
I've run with the idea that people are really unhappy, but now I'm in trouble.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote, and those who did, mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
The people elected the Senate in such a way that changes will be difficult to enforce.
Yet I will fight for my visions, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you thinking of forming your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to check the clean history of every potential party member, and I don’t even have money for that.
I don't even have the money for the presidential campaign, there's only $20,000 in my transparent account.
Don't you have any money?
You're talking about confessions, what's yours?
Private property, I estimate, is about 60 million.
In Prague I have a plot of land for about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art for about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb for a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have Aston Martin because it was my boyhood dream - I always liked James Bond, who rode in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought against vices and vices.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have a $60 million fortune, and you don't have the money to campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put much of your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Am I in debt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors suggests that my program probably isn't that interested.
And I'm not obligated to pay for the campaign on my own.
The cost of the campaign will essentially be covered by what I get for my senatorial salary.
But I wouldn’t survive it, for example, I couldn’t pay my son for an English school that costs $30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't be running.
So you're going to keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd suppress these activities?
It has nothing to do with the salary.
As promised, I partially shut down my activities.
For example, my travel agent will become my representative in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan who would save the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
As an entrepreneur, how much did you take per month?
Two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I'll take further.
And if I were president, I'd shut down my business.
You can find the entire interview in the Saturday edition of Právo.
MVRDV architects are proof that real adventures do not just happen in the head - for example, Spijkenisse and the recently built Mountain of Books - 2 pictures
"The building feels cheerful, it looks futuristic. Finally, there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, who goes around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a nearby large enterprise, says, "Of course, the house is nice."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
They all have internet, iPads and e-books.
No one goes to any of these old-style libraries voluntarily anymore, do they?
Spijkenisse, a housing estate close to Rotterdam without its own jobs that are not worth visiting, holds a special record.
With a population of 80,000, this municipality has the lowest level of education in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to solve this stupid situation, a few years ago the decision was made to contribute to the general education and to build seven nicely painted reinforced concrete miniatures of fictitious bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes.
But the success of the educational offensive was not at all dizzying.
And so the city councillors realized that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: we had to have a library!
Winy Maas of Rotterdam’s MVRDV architectural studio, a master of insanely bold column graphs and maker of funny, often even cynical, constructions, accepted the matter with the usual calmness and appeared at the 2003 competition with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the commission was still looking around in amazement and shrugging its shoulders, the brazen Maas was making his gifts on himself according to his size, and he ended his activist-justified speech with the words, "Dear urban communities!"
So this is my proposal for the Mountain of Books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million mountain was completed.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Mountain of Books was awarded the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Small-town grey, which so far could not offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall, behind whose white facade you would rather expect a dairy, is thanks to this it is richer in a bit of contemporary architecture.
Above all, however, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
A Long Way to the Book
First impression: the reader's Eldorado under the cheese lid.
There is an elevator in the middle of the mountain massif, but you will discover your true spatial and reading passions only when you walk through the topography.
From all sides, the glazed interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burnt cabr<0xC3><0xAD>n and the elegant street lantern clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, a dog and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books, books.
“Normally there are bookshelves along the facade, and in the middle is a large dark space, which is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We built the classic spatial configuration upside down and pushed the space for readers from the inside out.
The interior of the Mountain of Books is cleverly used: in the center there are offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an ecological center and a headquarters of home technology.
A special pleasure is the black bookshelves, which are one wall cladding, one window sill and another staircase railing.
Appearance, structure and smell are foreign.
Over the unknown building material, even committed architects and construction engineers twist their heads.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials here," says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, when asked by Standard magazine.
And so one day, at a farm in Friesland, we came across a suitable agricultural waste product.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, a millimeter fleece of synthetic matter has been used as a base under the roots.
It is cheap and time efficient.
Thin textiles last for one, two seasons and then are ripe for disposal into bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in such quantity - was pressed on plates four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous and load-bearing material that smells a little like a new car and a little like sports shoes.
After 105 steps you will reach the top.
At the end of the nearly 500-meter-long journey, you will be rewarded not only with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and figs in pots.
They take care of the atmosphere, but mainly the correct humidity in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a new soul
"You might not believe it, but this house is a model project in terms of ecology, despite the many glass surfaces," says Trouborst.
It heats and cools with the earth's heat.
Although the Mountain of Books stands under a glass lid, the sun shines in only briefly, even on sunny days.
Wide glued wooden truss, which stands perpendicular to the glazed facade, serves as a shading and captures a large part of the sun's radiation.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
They can handle the rest of the fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, an early IT skeptic, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And traditional Chinese medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even refers to Boekenberg as Spijkenisse’s “long-awaited soul.”
The reason: every resident of the city was invited to the opening a few weeks ago to donate one book from his personal fund.
The optical gaps in the not yet fully equipped library, which currently has 70,000 items, were to be filled first.
The concept has proven itself.
The shelves are full.
“There is nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, now every resident has a certain relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV succeeded in the royal discipline, which in professional jargon is called identity formation.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated he is.
This is the starting point for identity.
Szabo: 'Germans must play a bigger role'
Germany abstained from voting on the decision to accept Palestine.
According to US-European relations expert Stephen Szabo, Berlin is balancing on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany first signalled earlier this week that it would vote against a proposal for the observer status of Palestinians at the United Nations.
Berlin abstained from the vote.
Why? Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don’t think it will support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
In the end, NATO succeeded.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy, from a policy that was, so to speak, controlled by the US, towards German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult because Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
The Germans are on two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are just settling down in their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy, such as they have in France or in the UK.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It shows a readiness to take positions in the case of national interests that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, by exports and by its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to some extent different from those of other powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests influence the stance in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
First, Germany has large sales in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, they must be careful not to frighten the public, but not even the elites in Arab countries.
That plays a role anyway.
I would not like to attach too much importance to this, it is not a completely one-sided relationship.
This, however, plays an important role in German thinking.
Has Germany’s relations with the US been damaged when Germany abstained from voting on both important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I think there is a great deal of understanding in Europe and even in the US for the German position.
That is why I do not think it was as dramatic a turning point as it was in the Libya issue.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect from this.
This indicates that he must be considered an international player and his interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.
The U.S., on the other hand, has clearly spoken out in favor of the veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of American domestic policy.
I think that the Obama administration has a secret understanding of the European position.
But as a result of the political situation there, he cannot, of course, take this position publicly.
I don't think the differences in opinion are really as big as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not very enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policies.
Is it not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US, on the one hand, and its position as the most important partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's what makes it difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and unified European policy, which is not happening at the moment.
They cannot therefore be part of a wider line and must instead push things forward from their own position.
That’s what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in the future and push Europe towards a European position.
This, of course, is not easy for Germany because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive subject.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they need to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player? Does it even want to take on a major role?
Or is the leadership role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult for this country to play a bigger role.
For example, if we look at the European crisis, every time Germany takes on a bigger role, anti-German sentiment arises.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
It’s actually an old problem: we don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be acceptable to a wide variety of neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
The influence of the US in European politics is now constantly declining, but the EU is currently not filling this vacuum.
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it makes them uncomfortable and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, and so is Polo Ralph Lauren.
What is Armani Polo?
The name is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, it enjoys protection as long as it is not sued by the real owners of the brand.
And even then it is not clear whether they will get the rights.
“Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing’s office, which specializes in violations of protection rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new case lands on my desk.
Counterfeiters only need a few extra letters to register their brands.
For example, the Gucci brand will become Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada, they will have Prada-Kny registered.
In this way, German companies, such as the manufacturer of Puma sports goods, are also legally copied.
Pattloch opens a binder with records from the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company was allowed to protect the Zegna DF Puma brand, an artificial name that is also parasitic on the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
The Chinese are known to be world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-storey department stores, in which counterfeits are almost exclusively sold.
However, Pattloch’s cases are different, and he is acting on behalf of his mandate to prevent Chinese companies from receiving from the trademark office the official right to use a trademark that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an associated brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan".
That's what women who hunt rich men mean.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It hurts the trade, we have to fight it," Pattloch says.
"The brand is diluted, the exclusive status disappears, the damage to the image is enormous."
The financial losses and legal costs of the affected industries go into the millions, especially in the case of expensive demonstration products.
According to market research firm CLSA, China is the third largest luxury goods market and the fastest growing market with a volume of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion per year.
However, erasing dubious entries in the trade mark register can be difficult and costly.
The procedure can take up to nine years, with uncertain results.
Pattloch recounts cases in which the court dismissed the lawsuits because the accused name became a “market reality” after a long period of time.
If the plaintiff is unlucky, they have to pay the plagiarist for damaging his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes it's the law of the jungle.
The known cases also relate to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, a company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
To this day, the Chinese are allowed to use a badge that resembles a Mercedes star.
Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used a blue-and-white logo that resembled BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
Fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China with counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the CTMO admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too few staff and space.
But last year, it was reported that "the course of the work process has returned from an emergency situation to normal."
For example, the number of pending opposition proceedings decreased by 22%.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
There are still 81,500 complaints pending at the office.
Doing something about it is expensive.
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record, and it means that China is leading the list of new applications worldwide for the tenth consecutive year.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - there are 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan was collected on fees.
In simple terms, this means that each login costs an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
To start a dispute against it costs several times, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
The group has been fighting the Chinese plagiarist for more than seven years.
The Germans, however, achieved the abolition of its illegal production of imitation car parts.
However, the counterfeiter has secured the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand and continues to do so.
We would ignore this ourselves, as surnames cannot be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO stamp office also rejected the Munich company’s objection.
In two other instances, although Freudenberg won the rights, the opponent in the dispute is still fighting to this day.
You have to be very careful.
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the case will lead to a good end and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "Managing is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs cannot be quantified. They even had to go through a hundred-year-old file in the company’s archive to present evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the counterparty a “high six-figure sum in euros” to settle the dispute.
“You can see what that means to us,” says Wentzler.
The danger from the Far East is also threatening to hit Europe.
And that's in case the imitators secure the unprotected tags there.
One Chinese manufacturer, for example, wanted to apply for the Freudenberg label for footwear and leather in Germany.
This area of business has long been abandoned by the group, but it managed to reverse the registration.
"You have to be very careful," says Wentzler.
He and attorney Pattloch advise German businesses to be very careful when trading with China.
It’s not enough to rely on international trademark rights. Rather, foreigners should “have everything worth protecting in any way,” says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg succumbs to the brand in the final act of its drama, then it will probably have to pay royalties for its own name to the counterparty, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: stomping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is trying out - and in Swaziland, the orphans of parents who died of AIDS are delighted.
The story of a connection that covers much more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there’s the stomping: cowboy highs, basketball boots, ladies’ pumps, and men’s moccasins look for tact on the floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - are slowly raised - they insist, mum and chase each other.
The 29-year-old conductor, Fiete Hopf, almost lifts it from his textile shoes as he joins voices with his flowing wild gestures.
In the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is trying out a new song.
Fifty female singers and singers between the ages of 23 and 69, ranging from a human genetics researcher to a housekeeper, were interviewed.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each choir voice has a different text, and moreover in a very foreign language - the Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
Unaids, the United Nations’ AIDS programme, estimates that there are roughly 34 million people living with HIV worldwide.
Of these, 23.5 million live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 orphans in Swaziland after their parents died of AIDS.
More than 40 percent of the population is HIV positive.
For 180 orphans after their parents died of AIDS, Voices for Africa found patrons in the village of Esitjeni in Germany.
70 of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, patronage can be taken over.
It guarantees the child tuition, school uniform and one hot meal a day in the Gogo-center.
Imbongi means "storyteller" or "one who glorifies" in the Zulu language.
No one can speak Bantu in this space, only sing.
For almost a decade now, the choir has been rehearsing the song in this foreign soft language and occasionally bringing it back to where it originally came from: South Africa.
At an air distance of 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the power of the voices of the German corps.
Forty percent are infected.
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay or straw huts, many of them children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjena one can see in the small, than the whole of Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the male foreskin, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is not accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the virus of weakened immunity within them. It is not uncommon that they die in less than thirty years.
The village was discovered by the congregation on a trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but most of all, Imbongi members saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but everything: food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, they have no chance at all in a poor country.
Initially, it was still a private commitment of individuals, which for a few euros a year allowed to send a child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
A year later, however, the "Voices for Africa" choir was founded, which has since taken care of the orphans of parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, herpes genitalis, or hepatitis.
Mucilages and scabies belong to the parasitic SPI.
Who are the most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur primarily in men who have sex with men.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently are chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (mold), gonorrhea, and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in our country, but about 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV fall into this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur significantly more often than in other groups of the population.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, human papillomaviruses often occur among adolescents.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases need to be reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of people infected with syphilis more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of people newly infected with HIV has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
That’s about a tenth less than a year ago.
What symptoms indicate a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause sores in the genital area, difficulty urinating, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen and blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain undetected.
How can we protect ourselves?
The danger of infection can be reduced by condoms, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Because the causative agents of sexually transmitted diseases can be partially transmitted even by infection from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend, especially in the case of frequent alternation of sexual partners, regular examinations.
In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most of the SPI and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to the patronage, charitable gifts, and, last but not least, the royalties that the congregation earns by singing throughout Germany, some money will be collected.
"In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says the association's president, Annette Lennartz.
The money is managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a confident woman who can assert herself.
She also makes sure that orphaned children find shelter, for example, at one of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as it is called in the Zulu language to old women, are the backbone of the village.
Some of them also took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads and made sure that the children arrived every day in uniform on time to school.
Children who no longer have anyone go to the shelter of Khanyisile, a lonely woman paid for by the society, as well as two cooks who cook daily for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, Voices for Africa founded a school of sewing, built two hens, and, together with the American health organization PSI, arranged for many people in the village to be tested for HIV.
Even though the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone is silent about it.
The King and His 14 Wives
“AIDS is absolutely taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
In fact, quite strange in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolutist monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his prodigious lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-sanctioned way of life, among other things, is to blame for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread the virus on the ground.
Annette Lennartz says condoms are free on every corner, "but nobody uses them.
“Culture is different – unprotected intercourse.”
To encourage cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels together once every two or three years in southern Africa, singing songs of sorrow, combativeness, confidence in the future and self-confidence of blacks that many in the southern tip of the black continent have known since the days of apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the language of blacks - such an award brings not only mood and joy, but also has already drawn tears from many wild border soldiers.
The path always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the children, over whom they have patronage.
Although you can hardly find this village on the maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is light," they say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is the airline from here, 8733 kilometers, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, you can see that the light is shining here as well.
NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be up to 20 meters thick.
The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has confirmed the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that an ice sheet exists in an area of this planet that lies in a permanent shadow.
It is said to be at least 30 centimetres long and possibly up to 20 metres thick.
This water appears to have come from comets or perhaps asteroids that have collided with Mercury.
But let’s not put the finding of ice in relation to the existence of life on this planet, said the head of scientists working on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help explain how water and other basic elements of life got to other areas of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes, and small robots like the Phoenix, unobserved Earthlings, are involved in exploring the depths of space.
From time to time they send out images to the Earth, small windows into endless distances.
The image comes from a photographic instrument developed by German scientists at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets in our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the International Astronomical Union's new 2006 definition.
This clipping from the Spitzer infrared telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue dots, less identifiable are the pink-colored "newborns" in the birthing hall of the stars.
This star-forming region — unromantic scientists call it W5 — was discovered by Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This changing heat of a dying star has been captured by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The ring consists of material that the star ejected during the process of dying.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.

One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble Space Telescope: a vortex galaxy
Images of spiral galaxies become real works of art by their coloration.
The image, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows the Trifid Nebula, a few thousand light-years away in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, trigeminal), because dark streaks of dust divide the glowing heart of this stellar maternity hospital into three parts.
In the constellation of Haddonos, astronomers have photographed a harbinger of a cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies collide and must inevitably collide.
This star formation was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can call it the Southern Windmill.
The Hubble Space Telescope image shows the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
This 1,400-light-year-old nebula consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than normal household dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images from various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
This stellar nebula contains the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way Galaxy.
The cradle of the stars gives rise to ever-new additions.
Also, these star clouds, associated with the Rosette Nebula, are giving birth to ever-new young stars, 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this luminous galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust, only gas.
Scientists believe that it was formed only shortly after the Big Bang, when there was mostly hydrogen in the entire universe.
Our views of the universe: the most important telescopes
The telescope was reportedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, who used it to observe the stars a year later before Galileo Galilei.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become ever larger - and the views they convey are ever deeper.
The largest telescope in the world for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture had a diameter of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona.
It allows you to look into the universe using two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only a mirror measures an average of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Nevertheless, its diameter reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the cheap method of construction: the telescope is secured by a hook at a height angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at an altitude angle.
Its peculiarity is the high amplification of the luminous flux.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, equals the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, scientists in space are searching for extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - can help any computer owner who makes his computing power available.
A view of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
There's the Very Large Telescope - and it honors its name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at ESO’s Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror is to be 42 meters long and consists of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, the images can be counted first in 2018.
Two of Keck’s telescopes on Hawaii’s Mauna Kea volcano were considered the world’s largest until 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also uses the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes to view the universe.
Also on Mauna Kea is to be a new giant telescope - with a thirty-meter diameter mirror.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
However, the most important impressions from space are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Pictures of distant worlds have been provided to us since April 24, 1990.
The Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets since March 2009 — especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 candidate planets had been discovered since the mission began.
This image documents the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space on board the Ariane 5 rocket in 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists believe that there is ice at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, since Messenger orbits this planet much closer to the north pole.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was sent out in 2004 and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now confident.

Searching for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
Riding the Taly<0xC5><0xA1> mountain range can be called wildly romantic.
The minibus rattles along the road with many turns along densely forested hills, predatory rivers and simple rural buildings.
Everything is green and juicy, we almost seem to be in the Black Forest.
However, this one here is the farthest south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives a Caucasian ethnic group of Talysh, about which not much is known, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani and live to a very old age.
The final station is Lerik.
This town boasts too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which somehow does not fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe do not come here. Arriving from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too difficult.
At 323 kilometers, it takes eight hours, because the road is only one-lane.
The fabulous wealth for which the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the countryside.
However, Pilate Fatulajeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist attraction.
“Baku won the Eurovision Song Contest in May – and we’re going to have the oldest people’s festival in the world next year,” says Fatulayeva.
She's the director of the Longevity Museum, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of almost eight dozen Talysh from the area, who are over a hundred years old. Fatulayev shows a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he had a child.
The controversial star of the museum, however, is the sheepherder <0xC5><0x9E>irali M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>mov, who is reportedly 168 years old.
The birth certificate does not exist.
And given that the oldest person with documents was 122 years old, M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>m’s age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
This man was reportedly married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he reportedly fathered a daughter.
So, was <0xC5><0x9E>irali M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>mov wrong in his age by a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about elderly people in Central Asia.
"Apparently many older people live in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "there are also extremely many very old men in Sardinia."
However, due to the lack of evidence, no scientific proof of age can be provided, especially when the matrices are missing.
Every day a glass of melted butter
The fact is, however, that people in the area around Lerik live to a remarkable age in the Bible.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why are there so many elderly people in the south?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this by the special genes of the Talysh.
The director of the Fatuljeva Museum, on the other hand, believes that it is all about nutrition.
However, the fact that it is the caloric diet of Talysh who love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products, and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy, from a bromatological point of view, does not seem very credible.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayev lives.
At 97 years old, it is still relatively young for this latitude.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with a butcher's shop, which he untiringly sways.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayev’s sons and a daughter, both of whom are grandparents.
Two small children are also running around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests, which is served in typical bell-shaped glasses of "armada".
Mirzajeva’s white teeth form a perfect line and she hides long dark blond braids under her scarf, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so it did not look like it and kept the color.
"I've never used shampoo," Mirzaeva says.
A monthly pension is enough
She always ate only what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
In my entire life, I haven't even bought groceries in a supermarket.
Then she tells me about her husband who was in the army.
The worst was during World War II.
But everything improved when the oar was taken over by the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev.
Propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
However, the cult around the figure of the father of nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over the oar.
At least the old people in Azerbaijan do not suffer from poverty.
Mirzaeva receives a monthly pension of 230 manats (approximately the same amount in euros). This is the amount from which it is possible to live well.
And perhaps Mirza’s long-gray son is also right: “Old people enjoy great respect in our culture.”
They live in the middle of a big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.

Mohammed Morsi almost apologetically said that he temporarily limited the powers of the constitutional court and expanded his own to “save the revolution.”
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a Ph.D. from the American University in Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians and the world are not clear about.
Should the judiciary be deprived of power?
The 234 paragraphs that the centennial Islamist-dominated Constituent Assembly hastily approved in the 15-hour night marathon are of some concern.
As in previous constitutions, this proposal also says that jurisdiction is based on "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This has been and is a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that Islamists will use this vague formulation and the associated legal free space for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At the very least, this is explained by the newly added paragraph: In all matters concerning sharia, it is necessary to consult al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with a great influence on the whole of Sunni Islam.
This may not be necessary, but it may mean that the clergy will exercise oversight of the legislature, which would bring about a de facto disqualification of the judiciary.
There is a lot of interpretation in the Constitution.
The problem is also that the civil jurisdiction of the military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts were used by Mubarak’s government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The bill also calls for the state to “protect the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morals and values.”
This is so imprecisely formulated in legal terms that, with the help of this paragraph, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In plain language, this means nothing more than censorship.
After all, no paragraph in writing defines explicit equality between men and women.
However, another paragraph prohibits defamation or defamation of the Prophet Muhammad and his emissary.
However, it is unclear what constitutes defamation and how it will be prosecuted.
The wording that "insulting people" is prohibited is equally questionable.
Is a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of legal experts enough in this case?
The matter of interpretation, as much as much more in this proposal, which Morsi will submit for signature and, in his words, will "very soon" present to the Egyptians for the purpose of a popular vote.
“The revolution has returned.”
Opposition to the Islamists has been forming for weeks.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unison in Cairo's Tahrir Square on Friday night and vowed to destroy the constitutional charter before it goes into effect.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamd<0xC3><0xAD>n Sabbáhi, who came in third in the presidential election.
Nobel Prize winner and former director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed Baradei, said the draft constitution belongs "to the dustbin of history".
Through its short news service, Twitter accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to carry out a “coup against democracy.”
"If he calls a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," opposition member Yasser Said said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been punished," Egyptian opposition politician Khalid Ali was quoted as saying by Egyptian media.
Several judges said they did not want to oversee the referendum, making it invalid.
“The Qur’an is our Constitution.”
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood has declared an anti-demonstration, but out of caution, not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by many veiled women and Salafist supporters who cried out, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They said to Morsi, "Cleanse the land," and assured him, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
The struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would probably trigger a civil war-like state of affairs.
Morsi's supporters clearly didn't want to risk it.
The Muslim Brotherhood has said that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution have spoken out loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide which way the country should go.
A majority in favour of the Islamists' proposal is considered certain.
"The word 'human rights' does not occur even once"
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, reports Hafiz Abu Sa'da.
The 48-year-old human rights defender and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And in the new constitution, there are no words for 'human rights' even once," she complained in an interview with Welt am Sonntag.
Morsi's expansion of power to all three branches of power in the state forced the lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president has effectively abolished it," Sa'da complains.
But without civil society organisations, democracy cannot work.
Sa'da feels abandoned by the international community, which is watching the struggle of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
He could get his revenge.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: “You have created a monster that you can no longer control.”
Norwegian rakfisk: The most smelly fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country’s success be linked to the local appetite for exceptionally smelly fish?
Take a few overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Let it sit for a week.
This way you get a paralyzing smell of rakfisku, one of the largest Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, a beautiful view - and in the air hangs the omnipresent smell.
Rakfisk is a salted trout fermented in water for up to a year - it depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and cold, Norwegians here in Fagernes begin to gather for a festival dedicated to this, how to say it best, most captivating dish.
“You eat it raw and then drink it with a glass of aquavit,” says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called “Rakfisk General” who is responsible for the festival.
All around us people eat small cubes of fish and drink them with a large amount of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavit than rakfisk," says Havard.
The drink can beat the smell.
I'll try a few.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's similar to a piece of sushi that was on a long bus trip.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different time when there was poverty in Norway, and since there were no refrigerators yet, the fish were soaked in airtight barrels of water and salt in the fall.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, they came out and ate—the senses were no doubt dulled by alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and look for work, most of them emigrating to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants attracted by a large amount of work, high earnings and an extensive care system.
Residents of Sweden, an old rival that was much richer than Norway until recently, are streaming into the country for work.
The rakfisk is seen as something important, indispensable, albeit a relatively smelly part of the Norwegian past.
It is one of the most expensive foods on the market.
Although expensive is everything - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you 9 pounds ($14) per piece.
Norway often does not make it into the world's news - and it seems to suit the majority of the population.
The name of Anders Breivik, a right-wing racist extremist who shot dead 77 men, women and children last year, is still mentioned here with distaste.
Instead, the shooting is called the “July 22 event.”
The Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Behind Norway’s current wealth lies the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries in the early 1970s.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says our waiter Anna, who with her long blond hair and surprisingly blue eyes is a prototype of Nordic well-being.
We are, as they say, thoughtful people.
Her English, like the English of most of the people here, is absolutely impeccable.
We don't show off, we don't like showy.
Norway is very careful with its oil wealth - apart from a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund designed for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial crash was throwing away money they didn’t have, the Norwegians had the strings on their purse tight.
“As long as we can ski in the winter and go on trips in the summer, we are happy,” says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for something to eat - I've had enough of rakfisku.
Such a moose burger is definitely something else and is beautifully juicy.
But in the evening, the stinking fish is back.
The hotel in which I live is one of the many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for smelling the most demanding fish.
They have a link to a live TV show in which a butterfly-studded host is surrounded by rakfisque plates.
It's like a Eurovision song contest.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our scoring, Havard."
There is applause and laughter.
A man falls from a chair, perhaps overcome by aquavits.
Or maybe the fumes from all the fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a tough start
As incoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, Will Grant of the BBC looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In the city, which is clogged even in the best of times, steel barriers were erected closing several key routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent commuters from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive a presidential sash and take over the nation’s leadership.
They face a difficult task.
Mexico has done well economically under outgoing Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed an estimated 60,000 lives in six years.
“My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people in reducing violence,” President Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before shaking hands with the U.S. president, President Pena Nieto gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
Opinions about the new leader are also different in his old homeland, the populous and vast state surrounding the capital.
Straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, it is remembered in a good way.
Citizens attribute to him the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now drive to the city on one of the new highways that Pena Nieto built. These highways are a huge improvement over the perforated and bumpy roads that used to be here.
The plaques bearing his name also hang on the walls of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We expect it to bring real and lasting change,” said Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a friend and political ally, a state lawmaker for President Pena Nieto’s Party of Institutionalized Revolution (PRI).
We particularly hope for interesting and real changes in the area of security and the economy, which our country so urgently needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI party was ousted by Vicent Fox.
MP Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, much is expected from Enriqua Pena Nieto inside the party.
And he rejects the opposition's statement characterizing the new president as a man with no substance.
He is a very straightforward man, very concerned with the excellent vision of the country.
He's a great statesman, and most of all, he's a man who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, this is not the impression many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more obvious.
Tucked under highway overpasses in many ways resembles the suburbs of the capital of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the self-governing community are also persistent and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to help tackle drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, particularly the violence against women.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped in desolate places next to a huge waste dump.
When Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, far more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
At best, critics of Pena Nieto say that while in office, he failed to adequately address the problem of female murder.
And in the worst case, his leadership is accused of closing his eyes.
In a concrete house typical of a dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses her crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
Her family believes she was murdered by her partner.
“When I arrived at her house, it looked like someone had washed her body,” Buendia recalls.
There were post-stroke marks on it, and post-mortem stiffness had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which there is only one word: "Justice".
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what they were denied.
The state authorities treated me as if I were an old gossip, troublemaker, and whiner.
They want you to just accept what they say and keep quiet.
“But it can’t be right when there have been so many mistakes and omissions,” he says.
The Sherpa, which President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday, is accompanied by great responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by violent crime, and the new president has promised to make it a priority for the duration of his tenure.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was the governor," Olvera, a member of the PRI, said in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, says military prosecutor
A military prosecutor seeks to refute Bradley Manning's allegations of ill-treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed on the basis of Manning's ill-treatment in prison.
A soldier is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
A military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military prosecutor Ashden Fein, in a cross-examination of Private Manning at a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede, Maryland, claimed that Manning’s weekly visits with officers of the unit during his nine months in custody in Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination, which took place during a hearing held on a motion by the defence to dismiss a case brought against Manning on grounds of ill-treatment while in custody, which in itself is sufficient punishment, took place a day after Manning testified that he had contemplated suicide in custody.
An Army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then posted online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday's hearing, military prosecutor Fein and Manning went through the forms officers filled out after meeting Manning at Quantico Detention Facility, where he was held in high security from July 2010 to April 2011.
Manning's officers asked questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him about these forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he rated the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and rated the overall treatment at the facility as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, even though Manning’s officers directly asked how he was being treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns about the various problems orally, and that the officers who had visited him had spoken to him about these concerns and indicated that they would address them, but they had not noted these problems.
“They wrote down ‘no problems’ (after discussing concerns), and that didn’t necessarily mean I didn’t mention them,” Manning said.
Judge Lt. Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about the treatment of his person in January 2011 during a meeting with a commission assessing suicidal thoughts, which he had expressed in a form a few months earlier.
Manning responded that during this meeting, his intention was to achieve a reduction in the “injury prevention” regime.
The military said it used this restrictive regime (one degree under a suicide surveillance regime) to protect it and the safety of others.
“I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was fine and that I wanted to abolish this injury prevention regime... so that I could enjoy the increased quality of life that I have seen,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transported to a detention facility at a Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait and fainted one day because of the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was going to happen to him and what was happening in the outside world was very depressing.
"My world has shrunk only to the base of Arifjan, to the cage," Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Manning said that after arriving in Quantico, he spent most of the day (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was only allowed one mattress, blanket, slippers, some clothes and glasses.
He said he tried to walk because sleeping or just lying was against the rules during the day.
Manning said he always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards could not see his face when he turned to the other side at night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint against Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about the charges he made in Thursday's deposition regarding the fact that after being forced to sleep one night in his cell in Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of guards and other fellow inmates during the morning count.
Manning testified that he was not allowed to cover himself with his blanket during the counting.
In a hearing on Friday by the judge, Manning said that on the orders of his guards, he felt he had a blanket to put down, but admitted that no one had given him an order to put it down.
On Thursday, Manning said he was forced to sleep naked the night before because he tried to show the officer he was not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer he could use a belt from his underwear or his eyelids to hurt himself, but did not do so.
Manning said that night his underwear, his eyeglasses and his glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and that in the event of his conviction before a military court, which is expected to begin early next year, he will significantly reduce his sentence.
The defense said it planned for Manning to plead guilty to the lower crimes and to fight the other charges because they were too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to begin this week, and the military prosecutor is expected to defend the detention conditions as justified.
The Pentagon said in a statement that Manning was being held in accordance with regulations regarding all detainees held in maximum security custody.
The charges against Manning include aiding and abetting the enemy, unlawfully causing intelligence documents to be published on the Internet, transferring national security information, and stealing public property or records.
If convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to life in prison.
My Crisis of Mexican-American Identity
He says many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of options that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind them of hard times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely made it through the crowd and arrived at the immigrant agenda area, where I encountered a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Externjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds and didn't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and I've been called "Mexican" all my life.
It's an ethnic abbreviation, the same as when my friends in Boston call themselves "the Irish" and my friends in New York call themselves "the Italians."
So later I ended up with the label "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And there was no need to use shortcuts in my grandfather's homeland.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle both sides of a conversation in that language.
But I don’t have the vocabulary of a native speaker and I can’t get rid of an American accent.
So I pulled out my U.S. passport and lined up for the Extranjeros.
I was thinking about the moment when the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House this week.
They had the usual issues on the agenda, which are discussed when the leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs, and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are as likely to stay in Mexico as they are to travel to the United States.
It wants to join with the United States and Canada to create a trade bloc similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto has promised to continue the Mexican war on drug cartels, though he has not provided any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader under the threat of arms to transfer half of Mexican territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans who have been thinking for centuries, not minutes, the comments are omnipresent.
So a minute after the U.S. official says something a little bit critical about Mexico, you hear in the Mexican press and among the elite complaints about Americans interfering with their neighbor’s sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma will set out on the war path.
And yet, the real challenge for Mexico is the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people to whom the country offers opportunities, and others to whom it does not.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree there was a person, maybe a parent or grandparent, who was denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it would seem, this person corresponded to the profile - dark skin, poor education, origin from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even though we now live the American dream, go to good schools and have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live the American dream, not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It's against the United States.
And we know that many elite Mexicans in the ruling class don’t like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeat, and they see us as a inferior race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence, in their opinion, is only about failure.
If our families in Mexico hadn't failed, they'd never have left.
And we would not now find ourselves trapped behind a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally arrived in the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans understand more about who they are and Mexican Americans dislike it.
Even though she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don’t feel part of any of them.
We love listening to Mexican bands, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don’t have roots in either.
In Mexico, they see us as Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And to further complicate the relationship, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligence I learned on my trip want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as “provisional ambassadors” and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American compatriots how great it is to visit this country and press political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
Oh, well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And with income inequality and rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure it is a great country.
I have a feeling it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for the way it treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel disdain for the way their family members were treated in a much more recent past.
Mm-hmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
An end to the fighting between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The next round of bloodshed suggests that every such event is in vain.
Among the usual needless speculations about who started it, many buildings were turned into rubble, killing more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time rockets hit from Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Israeli capital, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their ancient conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order, and Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught up in the ensuing chaos in the region.
Perhaps this will make their struggle more bloody than ever.
However, there are reasons to think that this can break their deadly stalemate.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, there does not seem to be much reason for optimism at the moment.
Even if the November 21 cease-fire holds, this week's fighting has strengthened hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced Israelis to retreat, even though Gaza has suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million Gazans in one of the saddest and most populous corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine currently controlled by its fierce rivals in Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas can very well conclude that time is on their side.
Islamists throughout the Arab world gained more influence, so Hamas gained powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, a resurrected regional power that was once Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has joined Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the Gulf’s richest and most dynamic countries.
Exultant Hamas people say the Islamic crescent is circling around Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where Hezbollah is ruling, through Syria, where rebels who are increasingly inclining to Islamism can depose Bashar Assad, all the way to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
And above all, on Israel’s southern flank, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Mohammed Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and pivotal Arab country, has changed the balance in the region.
Gosni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his downfall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more influenced by public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as a player that cannot be ruled out by either Israel or America.
Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, will come to the opposite conclusion.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in a box.
Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system proved its worth, and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terms, America is as unshakable as ever, and many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the last round of violence.
And most importantly, Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been relatively quiet from suicide bombings, thanks in part to a wall that encroaches on the West Bank, a major part of what may one day be a Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements that are still growing despite their illegality under international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the campaign on January 22nd, is in a good position.
Why spoil those treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn’t they have fired rockets like their compatriots did in Gaza?
It's better if we hold them behind that wall and hit them when they stick their heads out.
The hardliners may win, but the Arab Spring can change their calculations.
While the Islamists, who are gaining power in Egypt and elsewhere, do not have much love for Israel, their top priority will be dealing with domestic problems.
Israel’s defense spending is higher than all of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a new war with the local superpowers will hardly help the new Arab governments to heal their economies.
That President Morsi worked with President Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good sign and could mark the beginning of something new.
The Israelis should also look at the situation from a long-term perspective.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, denying Palestinians the right to self-determination creates a barrel of gunpowder that must one day explode in Israeli-occupied areas – as does the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Already, repression weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics exacerbate this situation as the Arab population grows.
The bloody attacks against Gaza, which take place every few years in order to suppress Hamas, will increasingly collect a diplomatic tax.
Both sides need incentives from the outside.
The answer is what sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world, and these newspapers preach: two states where Israel cedes territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is little hope that a cease-fire will give outside pressures at least a little more leverage to push this thing through.
Egypt, which must work with Turkey and Qatar to halt arms supplies to Gaza, is in a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a 1967 Jewish state based on borders with parts of the country swapped and shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside must also push for a consensus between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty at the UN.
President Obama also has a part to play in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term in office, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems just as reluctant in his entry into the process.
That's pathetically short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australia’s laws on ugly cigarette packaging have come into force.
On unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, there are warnings for smokers and sick parts of the body.
Australia’s ugly tobacco and cigarette packaging laws, the world’s first of their kind, have come into force, replacing the brand’s logos and colors with generic olive-green boxes with hideous images of diseased body parts and images of children and newborns sickened by their parents’ smoking.
In addition to various health warnings and pictures, mandatory from Saturday, the only difference between the boxes are brand names that are printed in the same small font.
This is the strictest regime in the world regarding tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by ridding them of their attraction.
It relies on studies that show that if people do not start smoking by the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start smoking.
“Even in very young children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell them together with their product,” says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that, for example, showed that children associate the crown in the logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering introducing similar measures.
The tobacco industry has lobbied hard against these laws.
Tobacco companies have argued that the law will increase black market trading, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
“This legislation will lead to serious unintended consequences,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring much more of these products to be sold on Australian streets.
Others argue that the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, said the demand for silicone cigarette packs to cover disgusting boxes came two months ago when British American Tobacco, Britain’s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeals relating to laws to Australia’s Supreme Court.
Ha said Zico has sold nearly 6,000 units to wholesalers and expects new stocks.
It's good business for us.
As a possible hitch, experts cite the popularity of social media among the demographic group that the plan focuses on.
After a series of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sporting events and requiring most retailers to hide cigarettes from direct view, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict foreign sites.
“If you’re a tobacco marketer and you only have this little space left to promote your products, the online space is an unbeatable place to be,” says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Ms. Freeman noted an increase in the ranking of brands on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by the "average Honza".
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and took the job and created this video, or is a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry has focused on how to deal with new regulations rather than marketing.
The sector has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules – countries within the World Trade Organization declare that trade is unfairly restricted, despite none of the countries doing significant trade with Australia.
The decision of the SOO is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has been in talks with other governments considering similar laws on packaging.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
Now it has spread to more than 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considering tougher laws.
There are a lot of smokers in Australia.
The pictures have no effect on me.
I just ignore them.
“You just pull out a cigarette and put the box back in,” Victor El Hage says when buying a box with a photo of the tumor in his mouth.
Honestly, there's only one reason to quit smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns King of the Pack in central Sydney, says the uniform boxes make it harder for him to level the shelves.
"It took me one hour to unload the cargo, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we'd say, 'OK, that's it, let's close the shop,'" he said, shaking his hands.
In a world of constant connectivity, it’s not so bad to be bored
The last Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane was in mechanical trouble and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distractions of books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts on child development are increasingly coming up with praise for boredom.
They say that it is good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can encourage creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to some screen nowadays, we don’t have a chance to enjoy the boredom.
Should we encourage boredom?
Yes, sir.
Oh, no.
But I'll come back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively new phenomenon that occurred with the advent of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, says, he is the author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.
On the walls in Pompeii was found a Latin inscription concerning boredom, dating from the first century AD.
And then there's the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After viewing the research literature and presenting the idea to a target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of “wanting to do something that would satisfy me, but not being able to do it.”
Boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not involved in anything, but would like to be.
He says there's no compulsion in apathy to do anything.
He says that the core of boredom is "disruption of the attention process associated with a bad mood and a sense of slowly passing time."
Boredom can be a lot like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship, bored people tend to see the problem as an environment or a world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re bored when we’re just having trouble concentrating.
In their study, “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,” published in September in Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading an article from a journal.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated TV program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV program silently reported more boredom than the other two groups — they had trouble concentrating, but they weren’t sure why, and attributed the trouble to boredom.
When you’re trying to focus on a difficult or engaging task, distraction can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, “like finding the wrong parts on the factory line, distracting music can help you not get bored.”
In fact, he said, we now know that twisting and scribbling, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight boredom and keep people physically more alert.
“Research shows that children who are allowed to wobble learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still,” said Professor Fenske.
We've all experienced boredom at some point - the delay of my flight, the humming speaker, a particularly lengthy film.
Some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure boredom, scientists developed the Boredom Proneness Scale in the 1980s.
The scale includes questions such as, “A lot of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous,” and “I have so many interests that I don’t have time to do them all.”
Using these scales, researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need to have more and different external stimuli.
Teenagers, however, are generally inert.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren’t at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentage of boredom would be now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said he knows that “adolescence is a peak time for boredom,” which is largely due to children and youth not being given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: “Is boredom good for you?”
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, gamble or abuse addictive substances as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
“Boredom is the brain’s way of telling you that you should be doing something else,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn’t always know the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
However, if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a while, not for the long term.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he won’t be bored anymore, but he won’t learn how to entertain himself or drive himself, Professor Fenske said.
And "this separate management is transferred from one situation to another," the professor said.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain themselves, but will gain more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of it either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are out of the reach of constant buzzing activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We blame it on the need to be bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be connected to something meaningful," he said.
What people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy your free time.
"In an environment where we're constantly overstimulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain yourself when the noise goes off."
In Colorado, there is no guide to the new marijuana law.
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old college student and football player from southeastern Colorado, faces criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across the state — possession of a few grams of marijuana and the pipe he used to smoke it.
Mr. Orozco said that one September day he was driving with several friends in Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when he was stopped.
After a police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was issued a subpoena for possession of drugs and equipment for drug use - minor offenses for which there is a $100 fine for each - and was given a trial date.
"They treated us like criminals," Mr. Orozco said.
But he's a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks following the Colorado vote to legalize small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer to hundreds of smaller drug cases depends on the place rather than the law.
Hundreds of cases of marijuana possession offenses have already been dropped here and in the state of Washington, which has approved similar measures.
The police department has stopped blaming adults aged 21 and older for holding a small amount that will be legally allowed once the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative counties have said they will pursue existing marijuana cases, and are still accusing people of possession.
At the same time, several cities from suburban Denver toward the Western Mountains are voting to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana stores in their communities.
“This thing is going so fast that I don’t know what’s going to happen next,” said Daniel J. Oates, a police chief in the city of Aurora, east of Denver.
Regulators in the state of Washington are also cracking their heads.
And they're looking for guidance on how to set up a licensing system for growing, producing, distributing and selling - all by December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado, for better or worse, is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now for recreational use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good lead,” said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Licensing Board.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
“There is no real precedent that we can follow,” he said.
The Washington Act, known as the I-502, takes effect on December 6, which also leaves an annual vacuum during which there will not yet be a state licensing system, but legal possession does.
And there are tricky mechanical issues that need to be resolved during this time, such as how to balance a state directive on “appropriate access” to licensed marijuana with its ban on the cannabis trade within 330 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds or children’s centers.
“Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate a licensed cannabis trade than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently founded research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates of Aurora City sent an email to his officers informing them that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute offenses for possession of small amounts of marijuana by any citizen over the age of 21 and that the police would “immediately” stop blaming people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said police will enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck presents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to pressure users to seek treatment.
Currently, 119 people are facing charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many are facing further charges.
“Our office is required to prosecute criminal offenses that were criminal offenses at the time they occurred,” Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated in places like rural Mesa County, where voters have rejected a marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer charge adults with possession of small quantities.
The district attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision but has also decided not to dismiss all pending possession cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the hands of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And conflicting responses across the state revealed deep divisions among local officials in the face of this great state green experiment.
For district attorneys, it’s a “cultural barrier,” said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents defendants in marijuana possession and a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
“They have spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still can’t really accept that it’s legal,” he said.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on track to become national drug-legalization test cases.
Advocates and state authorities are planning new boundaries for legalized sales while also anxiously awaiting orders from the federal government, which still plans to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of marijuana legalization hope the Justice Department will give in.
Despite several arrests of medical marijuana sellers and patients who use it that have attracted attention, the federal government has largely kept medical marijuana stores in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states open.
While anti-drug agents are unlikely to slam the door to catch a small bag of drugs, they are likely to resist allowing state-regulated recreational marijuana trades allowed under the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for federal action.
Even before the election day, some local governments had approved moratoriums on any new marijuana trades, though it would still take about a year before any trade could open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose proposed a six-month ban and is likely to go into effect next week.
“We don’t want to be in a situation where we’re going to license someone and then we’re going to have a big federal issue,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are looking at what the city voted for, versus what the state voted for.
There are a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: “I was forced to leave Oxford because I am a conservative.”
It is not just today’s university students who are being attacked for their opinions.
I don't remember ever dreaming about going to Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother studied at what I thought was the world’s largest seat of knowledge, a modern, rambling Greek symposium motivating the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
So far, in the late 1980s, within two weeks of attending Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, I packed my bags and plunged into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I gave up because I objected to loving students in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson famously said that I left because I was forced to drink from battered mugs.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I escaped because I was subject to systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my rather bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for only one reason, and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a senior adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a Conservative supporter.
You may be wondering why I'm bringing this up now.
Simply because recent reports suggest that a new generation of students to the right of the middle are suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students called for the same protection of equal rights as gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the junior class association (JCR) at Corpus Christi College say that because of their political views, they are “often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks, and shown that they are not welcome.”
They call for the creation of a position on the university's Equal Opportunities Committee to ensure that they are free to express their views.
Their situation was not helped by the recently-released BBC Two documentary programme Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right about student political events, which portrayed conservatives as oddballs and neo-Nazis.
The show featured graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who rode a Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a silver-headed staff.
At other universities, conservative students say they are being treated like “sacrificial lambs” because of the introduction of higher tuition.
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that “leftist influence in universities is growing.
People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without meeting us at all.”
Corpus Christi’s 21-year-old history student Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says such a climate is “unpleasant,” while 19-year-old OUCA president-elect Stephanie Cherill says there has been a deterioration in JCR members’ approach to people on the right from Wednesday.
“This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to the well-being of members,” he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford, I was a one-member minority.
I joined in September 1986, 18 years old and paralyzingly shy.
Hatred for the Conservative Party was most bitter.
A year earlier, the university voted to refuse to award an honorary degree to former student Margaret Thatcher because of cuts in funding for higher education.
From the atmosphere, even the Stalinists would shudder with apprehension.
During the first few days of the opening week, when the new students meet each other and the professors, I got to taste the wormwood that was to come.
I have found that not only do professors tacitly approve of the bullying of conservative students, but they also participate in it with gusto.
A policy of mining strike, privatization, and government resistance to apartheid sanctions in South Africa was brought into the wood-paneled auditoriums.
My first lecture concerned the translation of an 18th-century French text into English, and I was unprepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I've been going through a lot of grief.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like cake dough, was very gally.
"Are the Thatchers refusing to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students shrugged.
There were tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, unless you're too busy with social affairs," said Professor Pitt.
Frustrated, I returned to my room.
At dinner at school, I was sitting alone when I felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
He was a second-year student named James, who introduced himself as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
I'm afraid that's the case.
Anyone suspected of conservatism is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna get worse for you.
Most conservative freshmen pretend to be Labour.
Later, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to pretend.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick proved to be unsuccessful.
A first-year student in philosophy, politics, and economics who (what an irony) went to Eton said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students took notes with him.
I was sick, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" one asked.
They beat each other up, don't they?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Would I have to turn into a labourer and suppress my natural inclinations?
For three years, I had developed a purgatory of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who resided at my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser and one of her speechwriters.
He was almost there.
He hated the place for its wickedness and pettiness, and for its penchant for the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he became a professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began commuting from Oxford to my parents’ house in London, seeking refuge with my disinterested metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in a city of dreamy moods.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect manners.
His wet eyes dimmed.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience deteriorated.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions.
The following week, while teaching, when another professor of history declared in all seriousness that I was the "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Even though I blushed with shame inside, I admitted that "my parents brainwashed me" and called them "old fools".
The relief was only short-term.
The nail in the coffin of my Oxford career was hammered by my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns a week in Murdoch's newspaper.
My door was locked.
I crouched inside, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a snot-nosed weakling.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subject to such intimidation and poisoning in an educational institution.
Even more tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, from which not only 14 conservative prime ministers emerged, but which also to this day hides behind the undeserved reputation of a place with equality and freedom of thought.
“Valentino prefers elegance to fame.”
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation", which opened this week in London, ABC spoke with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabella I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting the Valentino Garavani exhibition.
The designer confirmed this at the launch of the festive retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation", which presents more than 130 models of high fashion created by his studio over the past 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist who could not have been written without his esteemed clients.
Valentino had always felt enchanted by the rare and distant world of the aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which will last until March 3, is full of private correspondence and photographs with the signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to the Greek Princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from the town of Voghera in the north of Italy to the idol of the international “bohemian cream”.
There is nothing wrong with loving the royal family.
"At least they're not going to tuck your cigarettes into a great carpet like some wonderful pop-music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the 60s and 70s we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests are entertained abundantly and with elegance.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his chat in Gstaad," explains "Heini" Thyssen's ex-wife and close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
“Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
He’s still a star.”
Valeria Mazza presents Valentina
The charisma of the designer is not forgotten even by the Argentine model Valeria Mazza.
"It's been many years since we went to his house for dinner after a show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were twenty of us, and between us were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, decoration, food, music, in everything he was reflected and his spirit was felt.
He made everyone who was invited feel important and loved," recalls the top model, who began working with him during Paris Fashion Week in 1995.
"He will never go out of fashion because his designs are works of art," he concludes.
The Show of Nobility
Gravani’s life is not a story of obsessions, but of truly reciprocated love.
He loves people with good manners and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been rebuilt into a distinctive seventy-meter-long passage that offers a role swap: the visitor turns into a model and marches through the passage to observe the "community" of dreams wearing Valentine's masterpieces like the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis.
In the audience of the model shines names such as Sibilla Luxemburg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascalová and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentine is the first love, "you can not forget about it."
"I remember it perfectly.
They were trousers, shirts, a vest "gillette" and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muse.
“I prefer him to the others because of his femininity and his great love for women, because he underlines our beauty,” the former Duchess of Feria added.
“I really like the colors he uses, they brighten a lot and give a ‘spark’ to his face.
The proportions are perfect.”
Not even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can forget how she first dressed Valentina.
When she was growing up and living in Italy, she wanted to be an adult and have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
It finally arrived in the late 1990s.
"I bought my first dress from Valentino to celebrate at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a skirt with ruffles, a fringed bodice, and a shoulderless top.
It was a dream that became a reality,” says the widow of Rodrigo d’Arenberg.
"Valentino is lax to fashion, his passion is timeless," explains an Italian aristocrat whose life takes place between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has stored the designer's festive dress "very carefully ... because the dress is not just a dress, it is also a set of memories that they have in themselves".
The "King" of Fashion
The highlight of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding to Pavel Greek in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls his seamstresses) to create these silk dresses of ivory color with sewn pearls, twelve types of different laces and a four-and-a-half-meter-long tunic.
According to journalist Suza Menkes, the greatest authority on the specialized press, this dress represents a milestone in the high fashion of the late 20th century, the "return of high-society clients".
Valentino, dazzled over the years by the elitist "savoir-<0xC3><0xAA>tre", is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest decoration in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and decorated with the Order of the Legion of Honour accumulates as much honor as any of the spouses of his clients.
“My attention has always been drawn to his exquisite, calm, well-groomed and perfect appearance,” Princess d’Arenberg admits.
“The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
It was perfect, time left no trace on it."
If the princess says so...
The world's toughest craft: sulfur carriers in the Kawah Ijen region
For four euros, the bearers in the Indonesian volcano area are gambling with their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur down steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who make a living by mining sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, they must fly every day to the bottom of the crater, where sulfur gases escape from the interior of the Earth, and when in contact with air, it passes into a solid state.
After cutting large blocks of sulfur, which together weigh up to 70 kilograms, he carries them on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets along steep stone paths.
To the summit of the volcano, which rises 2,386 meters, it is only 250 meters, but the exhausted carriers take over 40 minutes to climb the turtles at a rate of up, as they maintain balance and carefully consider their steps so as not to slip and collapse into the abyss.
They know that any trip could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell from the cliffs of Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners in Kawah I only earn five cents for every kilo of sulfur they mine.
When they are at the top, they make their way around tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in a circus, and wearily carry heavy baskets to the weight that the mining company placed a little lower, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
PT Candi Ngrimbi has been mining the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulfur.
Then it sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar.
“Because we normally carry 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.8) for each trip,” explains Anto, who usually completes three trips a day.
One trip takes him three hours and at the end he is destroyed, but he can earn 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Although this seems like a negligible amount for such an inhuman effort, it is three times what he would have earned in the field.
"The daily wage of the miners is very high here. For example, the collection of coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day, and the salary for a fortnight is two million rupees (167 euros), "explains a carrier who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near a volcano, for a serious reason that is as convincing in Indonesia as sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali who is Hindu, and I took her to a convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, he's short of breath, he's still coughing and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto risks his life three times a day in the volcano Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to take its toll on him, despite the fact that his face is protected by a special mask and glasses.
He's got asthma, he's short of breath, he's still coughing, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases escaping from the volcano.
This is the price you have to pay to achieve your dream.
“I’m going to work another two years because I want to open a business or study Spanish or French,” he promises more than decent English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man, struck by fate, could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a receptionist at a hotel, and instead does the work of a porter.
She shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and wakes up every day at two in the morning, because the sulfur at night does not stop bubbling and its characteristic yellow color turns blue and glows dark.
Despite the darkness, Anto lights up the crater and lights his way with a small flashlight, which he has attached to his helmet and bought with his own money.
About 400 carriers carry out on the shoulders of a basket with sulfur from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has a high income, it has not mechanized sulfur mining to save costs, nor does it provide any equipment to self-employed carriers with such effort.
In fact, they don’t even get a share of the 30,000 rupees (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.5) from the photography surcharge, which, along with the 15,000 rupees (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2) ticket, is picked up by park rangers from tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and its human mule.
"This job is for cattle, not people," says Madrusin, a tough 42-year-old carrier who has worked at Kawah I only for three decades since he left school.
He can lift up to 110 kilos and assures us that he can keep working "as long as he can" because he needs money to educate his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although sulfur burns the throat and stings in the eyes when the wind unexpectedly turns and traps the miners in the dense fumes that come out of the volcano, the miners are so hard that none of them complain that they suffer from serious diseases... but this is evident from their frequent respiratory problems, arthritis, pain.
Unainik, who balances his basket on his back, can only load up to 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his colleagues extract 15 tons of sulfur in a volcano, which is then transported by three trucks by a steep path between the thickets to a warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life,” Unainik says, opening his mouth wide, missing several teeth.
Of his five sons, the eldest, 30, also earns money by mining sulfur.
Time passes, but the constant misery of one of the world's most difficult crafts persists from generation to generation - the crafts that human mules do in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans are seduced by the fact that they do not have children, by career, stress and the cost of living and education.
"Singapore's population needs to grow."
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot.
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of a menthol candy ad, but still – or perhaps because of it – the video went viral on YouTube earlier this year in Singapore.
These sentences are part of a rap that uses local cues like “put a bun in the oven” as a mockery of Singapore’s birth rate.
Advertising agency BBH, which created the video, hopes that they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a funny way with this advertisement.
The agency’s artistic director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the influence of music to make people fulfill “their civic duty.”
“It’s all about the internet, so it must have been fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world at reproducing our population, so we felt it was a topic we had to touch.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot of things like expand perfumes with pheromones or organize dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not entirely functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing possible, like rap composition, to solve this problem."
1.2 children
Anyone who doesn’t take it lightly is the Singaporean government.
It spends $1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government’s marriage and family package provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and allocates financial benefits.
However, all these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy city-state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its officials and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore with regard to the stratification of the population is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the birth rate exceeded the value of 2, which is considered the rate of recovery, was in 1976.
Why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the marriage and family department at the National Population Authority, said it was because of “better education” and a “broader range of career opportunities.”
“People have a wider range of options when it comes to life goals and priorities, it’s not just about marriage and family,” he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of single people and to the postponement of marriage and childbirth, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
While there have been efforts under immigration policy to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against population decline, this has caused resentment among locals.
On some Singaporean websites, there is undisguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and for making little effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore’s ruling party recorded its worst election result since independence last year.
After the elections, there was an effort to solve the problem through quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
The Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in birth rates has known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, health care spending, and immigration policy, there have also been some unexpected consequences in the case of Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it began to affect the real estate trade.
The Office for Urban Development began to regulate the number of small apartments known as "bot boxes" that can be built in certain urban areas.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have had great success in sales.
However, there is a concern that these apartments can promote a youthful lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of development firm EL Developers, claims that their “bot boxes” sell much faster than larger homes.
“They’re more popular because they sell days to weeks faster than larger houses.
That’s why they’re so much better for our cash flow.”
However, it admits that the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Over-stressed
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules could aim to increase the nation’s birth rate, an interview with Singaporeans working in the city’s financial district suggests they won’t have much effect.
“People are still stressed, houses are expensive, as is education, which is why many people put it off,” the young official said.
"Let the others have children.
But it is important for me to rely on my own money and time,” says another, about 20-year-old, young man.
Both men and women cite career, stress, and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So no matter how the government tries to force citizens to have children, it is the Singaporeans who have the final say on starting a family.
What is private offline is private and online
Privacy.
According to the dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, it is something that has a personal nature or “an area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any disruption”.
What is privacy for a person under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he posts things on the Internet that he would certainly not tell anyone in normal communication?
Journalists from elPeri<0xC3><0xB3>dico interviewed five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy to be "totally their own" on a personal level and "username and password" when it came to social networks.
“I wouldn’t reveal my biggest secret,” said Jorge, 10, in an effort to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom might know about them, but not the whole world," he says.
"I put nice pictures or photos on FB as we play.
I also talk to friends there.
I wouldn’t share a photo that wasn’t mine, or a photo that made someone laugh,” she says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, photographs of naked persons or photographs of crimes, or to write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine Twitter followers.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
“I set up a Twitter account to express my views and make interesting posts.
I don’t know if anyone will answer me, I just put them there,” he adds.
“Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or quickly communicate with friends,” he says.
Without hesitation, he says that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended him to someone he didn't know.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space, and Ask, and admits he doesn’t know 20 people on his friend list.
"I'm not afraid of it because we have something in common, like music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them were pointing him at anything, not even asking for his address or phone number.
“If they insist on me or demand that I do so, I will simply remove them from my account,” he admits.
Jose signed up for Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
These guys are no strangers to the experience of what is now called cyberbullying.
"A friend of mine was blackmailed on social media.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
According to Jose, the victim did not log out of the account.
"You just activated a private mode."
Then, it explains a series of steps on how to set up your account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would post photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would if someone bothered me or if I just wanted to.
“I know it’s cyberbullying,” he said.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate of Education and Teaching, believes that in order for children and adolescents to be properly oriented in social networks, they need to understand that the main goal of these networks is to inform.
“The Internet was created as a means of finding information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed.”
Marrielos Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate of pedagogy at Yale University and author of Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants, introduced these terms to explain the phenomenon.
“Digital natives are children and young people who were born in the age of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and yet we are still learning for ourselves,” he says.
He explains that this is a complex topic, "because we ask them to discern what is appropriate to disseminate, publish and say, and what is not, at an age when they are not yet ripe for it."
Also, to be – as far as the environment is concerned – prudent, at a time when what they most desire is to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences,” he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is is, asking questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do something doesn’t work,” he adds.
Next, Marrielos Porras lists some of the options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like someone to post your picture the way you posted your friend’s?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you tag people in photos from the celebrations, did you ask for their permission?
And one more thing: Does everyone need to know what you're doing all the time?
The next point is to realize that they must behave in the Internet environment as well as outside it.
They're the same rules.
“A person is governed by respect, morality and other principles outside the Internet, and the same should be on social networks,” he said.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, first-degree teacher and educational advisor, explains that it is essential that parents of children carefully read the rules of social networks.
“If they understand every little trick, they have a good reason to talk to their children about the consequences of setting up an account on the Internet.
For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to be shared or published,” he says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule of "don't talk to strangers".
South American Summit Ends and Lima Statement Not Published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru today ended without issuing the Lima Declaration, which was announced and allegedly signed by the seven presidents present.
Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of the heads of state and government of Unasur, but representatives of the foreign ministry and the presidential office, who initially determined that the document will be published after the summit, said that it will later be published on the website of the Peruvian government.
They also said that the content was published by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in several short press statements.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video from the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room without sound, with the message "confidential session, audio transmission prevented."
The small amount of information available to journalists was provided by the press spokespersons of some governments who were present, but not by Peruvian spokesmen.
The only document published during the meeting was a list of participating presidents, which caused the reluctance of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent an e-mail to the media with a “final statement” from the summit, but this was only a statement by President Humala, and not an official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of the South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Pa<0xC3><0xAD>ses Arabes, ASPA), and even on this occasion, the originally promised Declaration of Lima was not published, although the press was eagerly required.
On the official website of ASPA, it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure that the broadcast was broadcast to all journalists, but completely prevented the flow of information.
The summit ended, among other things, with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to adopt the Hague Court’s judgment, which resolves the border dispute between the two countries.
Peru’s President Ollanta Humala and Chile’s President Sebastián Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which on Monday will begin to discuss the dispute initiated by Lima against Santiago by hearing a defence speech by both sides.
"We will submit and execute a verdict that will resolve the dispute that we are discussing today in this international court," President Humala and his Chilean counterpart said.
"Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts," Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era added, greeting President Humala with a handshake at the flags of both countries.
The two presidents' confirmation that they would submit to the International Court of Justice's decision was made public after Colombia adopted the Bogota Pact this week, thereby expressing submission to the judgments of the International Court of Justice, which ruled on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered this decision to be completely wrong.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 following the impeachment of then-President Fernando Lugo and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was tasked with opening the morning speeches and concluding the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The president read the final document, in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 projects between South American countries had been planned, with investments amounting to $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR member states will take “important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, which is why residence agreements are being extended”.
“We support actions to improve cooperation in the fight against civil uncertainty and international organized crime, to improve access to medicines and the low-cost Internet in all corners of South America, and to take joint and effective action against the risks of natural disasters.”
When Europe is in crisis, "economic consolidation [of Latin America] should not be about winning, but about expanding our productivity and showing our nations a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve transport links between various places in South America, especially rural and border areas ... so that our countries are better connected and create new economic ties," the Peruvian president said in a read-out speech.
He mentioned that five of these projects relate to Peru and the transverse axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and the other two relate to a better connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide further details.
The final document also touched upon the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to return it to the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
Another issue highlighted by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful region that is whole and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before attending a regional meeting that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega in Mexico on Saturday to discuss with respect the International Court of Justice's ruling on the maritime border dispute, which is being challenged by Bogotá.
"It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow," Santos said.
“We will discuss all the solutions, none of which are excluded, not even a treaty with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with that country,” he said.
“I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we are conducting the negotiations in the most civilized and considerate way possible,” Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday to attend the inauguration of President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieta.
As part of the summit, EU defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
The members of UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the latter is currently excluded.
Peru is the interim president of the regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa said the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which “South America, in this case really, has to learn from Europe.”
Correa, who attended the sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on state television TV Per<0xC3><0xBA> that Europeans "killed each other in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically one country."
In this sense, the project advocated the creation of South American citizenship, which Unasur member countries support.
“It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country, which is already taking place among the members of the Andean Community, but there are also backward regions that want to return us to the past,” he said.
Ecuador's president has said he agrees to a regrouping of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states be reduced and that those who signed the San José Human Rights Pact be taken into account.
"Those in the lead never commit to anything, and we South Americans, on the contrary, will sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington is funded by the United States,” Assange said in a reference to political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he did not regret the decision because it did not betray his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at the time, “there were reasonable suspicions that Assange could be extradited to a third country regardless of the ongoing process.”
In addition, he criticized the Swedish justice system, which asked him to be interrogated in the Swedish territory for an alleged sexual offense, while "Swedish legislation allows for an interrogation by videoconference, which could take place from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's physical and mental health could deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's been at our embassy, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a small lung problem, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
"But his physical and mental condition is at risk of worsening because he is confined to a small space with no possibility of movement in the fresh air.
It would affect everyone’s health,” he added.
Correa noted that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on the basis of a permit that allows him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European courts, and stressed that talks were held with London to resolve the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
"We do not negotiate on human rights, we do not use such a word in this case, but there were constant talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European courts, because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzon, is leading a series of proceedings in various European instances,” he said.
He said: “If the UK issues a pass tomorrow, it will all be over.
And if Sweden hears Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or via Skype, as the legislation there allows, and as has already been done in other cases, the problem will be resolved tomorrow.”
Correa took advantage of this situation to present himself as a defender of press freedom, and made it clear that he definitely does not tolerate “under-averageness, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression.”
“The greatest enemies of a free press are not us, vile and depraved politicians, but the bad journalists at the service of profit, coercion and blackmail.”
From this point of view, he expressed his joy at the fact that neither such journalists, nor bankers, nor hegemonic countries, nor the bourgeoisie control Ecuador, and said that if re-elected, he would continue to make changes in the right way and in the right direction.
Correa also supported the decision to continue to veto Paraguay's membership of Unasur until at least its next elections, arguing that the whole "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and putschism cloaked in legality" because it "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
In addition, the Ecuadorian president said that he considered "completely appropriate" the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, in the wake of the International Court of Justice's ruling in favor of Nicaragua.
The verdict is not currently accepted.
“This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be assessed broadly in order to be overcome and to be able to move forward.”
He also expressed hope in resolving the maritime border dispute, which is being settled in the same court in Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if both countries commit themselves to accept the verdict, no matter how harsh it may be."
In connection with the possibility that he will run in the next presidential election in Ecuador to run in the order of the third mandate, he noted that he perceives this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is very difficult".
Correa has said that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will retire from public life.
"Personally, I have never been interested in power, but such unjust situations as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be corrected by political power.
My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this likely victory, so we have to accept that responsibility.”
“If I win, it would be my last presidential term and then I would leave politics.
If we lose, it's the same for me.
I have made a decision,” he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
“I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who says that President Chavez went on planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign ended.
This is not a relapse in the health of the president," he explained.
The Ecuadorian head of state today attended the sixth summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
Today’s AIDS victims are the result of a late diagnosis.
Fabrizi was 21 when his HIV-positive test was confirmed.
"It was as if lightning struck me," he says, recalling a moment of truth that the doctor had tried to "relief a little," but apparently without success.
The boy kept it a secret from his family.
He decided to take his illness on his own and began to inform himself about it with such commitment that he celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which he entered in 1994 after several bouts with the disease.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options, and more stigma.
At the time, even the director of the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) clinic didn’t say goodbye to him, “because he had a cut.”
Back then, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are many people who do not know about their disease and come only when the virus has caused the destruction of the organism and amplified the immune system, and then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since AIDS first emerged in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, "it is a great success that the life expectancy of a patient who begins treatment in a timely and appropriate manner is exactly the same as that of healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara in a press release.
Andrade Villanueva, an HIV/AIDS infectious disease specialist, explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of survival and a full life depends on the degree of disability of the immune system of patients diagnosed with the disease, better off than those who do not use drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 500 years.
Simply put, this means that a person who is diagnosed with HIV at age 25 can, according to this knowledge, “live without problems up to 75 years while adhering to treatment,” the doctor explained in an interview.
To highlight this progress, it is worth recalling that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who have died from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the yearbook of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since the discovery of AIDS, according to national statistics.
In the state of Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and 187 so far this May. However, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured since 2005.
Why do people continue to die from the effects of the disease?
"It seems to me that the problem is not in the access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it happens in the hospital.
The problem is that patients come at a very advanced stage, because they do not know the state of the disease, that is, in the late stage of the disease."
He adds a persuasive figure: "Nine out of ten patients come when some associated infection has already manifested itself. The only thing to do in order to influence the overall mortality more is to diagnose the disease earlier, and therefore it is necessary to offer tests on a large scale to detect the disease to all persons who request them."
In his proposal, he agrees with specialists and officials from the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in the state of Jalisco, as well as directly with patients like Fabrizio, who came to have tests done in a private laboratory just because his friend did it, and despite his young age, he had already developed AIDS and also suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous disease.
“Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather do it three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was for the better, I eat healthy, I exercise, I take medication.”
To this day, all his parents know is that he had cancer.
“I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I take care of myself and the other person,” says Fabrizio, who accepted the invitation to share his experience with the daily MILENIO JALISCO, to motivate those who are afraid with his testimony today as part of World AIDS Day.
"Let them get tested. If they risked it, let them know as soon as possible if they are HIV positive, it's better. And if they have been diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like anyone else if they are responsible."
This message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a big gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara-based journalist who is seeking information on the HIV virus.
The biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places that are dedicated to this task, "there has indeed been an increase in the distribution of condoms, they used to give us one or two, today they give us packages and a hundred condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most susceptible to new infections are adolescents.
“What do you want it for?” is a common question full of irony and judgment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy staff, and medical staff who teens want to avoid, the reporter says.
He proposed to change this ineffective distribution, so that the condoms would not be just behind the counters, but in the dispensers in the public toilets, in places where young people often go.
“It’s not an endorsement of promiscuity.
Nor is it about “paying them for beer and a motel,” as Governor Emilio González responded when asked if he would agree to distributing condoms in his district.
It is best to make condoms available to those who already lead a sex life," he said.
Key numbers in Jalisco
There were 13,435 cases (12,158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV).
In Mexico, the condition ranks fourth in new and identified cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV-related cases.
92% of infections are sexually transmitted, 6% are blood-borne and 2% are perinatal.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV, as for one registered case there are four to five people who do not know about the disease.
The judgment approved by the United States Court of Appeals, which does not recognise the debt restructuring of Grupo Vitro set by the bankruptcy in Mexico, sets an unfortunate precedent for any national enterprise with branches in a neighbouring country and a solvency problem.
Thus, it seems that the procedures of restructuring companies, which are allowed by Mexican laws, in the country of stripes and stars, despite international agreements, do not apply.
The June 15 ruling by Judge Harlin Hale at the North Texas Bankruptcy Court leaves Mexican firms defenseless against the possibility of their assets being confiscated across the El Bravo River.
However, the ruling opens the door to the U.S. Supreme Court for the main Mexican glass producer with an appeal against three irregularities.
To begin with, while the judge of this case claims that creditors are to be governed by United States insolvency law, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings lay down bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
Firstly, it would point to the lack of knowledge of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational enterprises.
Essentially, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Commercial Law was created for this purpose, which determines the organization of the American Law Institute as the arbiter.
Secondly, the judgment provides that without the vote of the branches of the internal corporate structure, when the debt of the parent company Vitro to the branches is recognised, the required majority for the approval of the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is allowed by Mexican law.
The fact is that the case of Vitro was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, such as Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intra-corporate debts were guaranteed by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.
In addition, it is true that even after deducting the votes of the branches, the creditors - who opposed Vitro in the United States, i.e. the "soup" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergenceia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - would not have achieved a majority.
The vote would reach about 45 percent to 37 percent.
This figure is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
From a different perspective, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - against the background of a serious economic crisis that has hit the United States.
Meanwhile, the family-owned firm González Sady will appeal the re-examination directly to the appellate court for the re-examination to take place with the full participation of the five judges, since only three originally voted.
If it fails here, it will demand as an appeal a review of the trial by a higher instance, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
In the case, the court omitted a document sent by the Mexican government as an amicus curiae, detailing Vitro’s procedure under the Bankruptcy Act and pointing out that the company had made it easier by adhering to agreements signed by the two countries to confront the Act with Chapter 15 of the Act.
In addition, it points out that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. rules designed for international insolvency cases that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: punishment for Vitro and the state.
Overall rating
Unnoticeably, a criminal complaint filed by the Mexican Aviation Union against Gast<0xC3><0xB3>n Azcárrag Andrade, the former owner of the company, was on the table for several months and, according to the pilots’ union, the vessel had already overflowed.
An instance led by Carlos D<0xC3><0xAD>az Chávez Morineau has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which it accuses of obstruction of justice.
According to her, the Audit Office systematically refused to report to the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Republic on the transaction carried out by this entrepreneur, in which IXE collected 198 million pesos from Fideikomis F/589 on behalf of Mexican Aviation.
The funds were most likely directed to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Management (Administradora Profesional de Hoteles).
Azcárraga Andrade is the majority shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Siege of Dragon Mart
At the Universidad de Caribe, a group of domestic and foreign ecologists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens gathered at the weekend to approve the creation of the association, in order to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Kank<0xC3><0xBA>n.
We are talking, as is known, about a huge trade and distribution center with products from the "land with a large wall" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential zone for employees of 150 companies at the bottom.
Previously, Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformaci<0xC3><0xB3>n) had been able to unite the governors of the south-eastern zone to oppose a monumental site that would partially devastate the protected areas and represent the origin of all resistance to industry.
The end of ACTA
The Senate’s motion, which the government ignored and which demanded an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican ambassador signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement in Japan, known as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial), is out of date.
As is known, this happened despite the fact that the Senate itself ruled out the possibility of considering it a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been involved in this indoor sport for more than 60 years and has travelled the world thanks to it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was passionate about the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a junior player, a player of the national basketball league BSN, the owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n team in the national basketball league, or the president of the Puerto Rican Basketball Federation.
“I’ve played a lot of roles in my life in basketball, including a few at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN National League in the 1990s, CEO of the national team, and chairman of the federation,” Reyes recalled during a visit to Primera Hora reporters at his home in Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n, where he has lived for more than 50 years with his faithful husband, Isabel.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs from his long career, testify to this.
Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n in the heart
With the greatest movement of all, he guards those that recall his time at Los Vaqueros from the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or team owner.
"These were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to participate with the Los Vaqueros team since 1967 in eight championships, whether as an owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy made his debut at BSN.
Then the team took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," Reyes said.
“I remember Gene Bartow, who used to coach here and was at the University of Alabama at Birmingham at the time, said to me, ‘I have a two-meter tall player for you.
Do you want it? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended the quarterback Raymond Gauss, who became a member of the team and one of our top scorers.
I remember he said that if Mincy brought Bayamona victory in the championship, Gauss would contribute to the next.
The championship, when los Vaqueros played for the team of Gauss, he enjoyed, but only remotely, because in 1988 he already held the post of president of the basketball federation.
At that time, he wanted to fully devote himself to his functions and enjoy Mincy’s position in the national team.
“I remember the first time we defeated the United States in the Olympic Qualifying Game in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we finished fourth, but we should have had the bronze if it wasn’t for the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final line-up,” Reyes said.
Is the team from the 1990 World Cup the best national team you’ve ever seen?
He is among the best, as well as the one who defeated the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team at the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won gold and beat the United States team, which was quite similar to the team that blew us bronze at the World Cup.
This team not only had Mincy, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, and "Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n" (Ortiz), but there were also young men (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Col<0xC3><0xB3>n and James Carter, Leon brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be on the team in 1990 due to injury.
The team that may not have had the perfect composition, but managed to win us a gold medal and bring us great joy, was the team from the Olympic qualification in 1995 in Argentina's Neuquén.
With roster players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner replacing players eliminated due to a skirmish at the Pan American Games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
It was without a doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has achieved such results at this level as Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Not to mention his work in various leagues where he played.
Who is the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very difficult.
We had a very good generation, which includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I love the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you consider to be your greatest achievement in the Federation?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team from 1988 to 1995 and that in the early 1990s the national league BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What have you failed to prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, like the division of youth categories by region.
For example, that the boys from Ponce would play only in their own area and compete with teams from other parts of the island only in national play-offs.
Now children travel a lot and play too many matches, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefit in mandatory certifications and courses for coaches, assistant referees and referees.
That's nice to meet you.
What do you do now?
I mostly listen to music, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, was world-famous for starring John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the Dallas television series, in which he portrayed a man who acted ruthlessly and was insidious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as predatory oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the Dallas television series became a symbol of poverty in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned as J.R. in the new Dallas series this year, died Friday afternoon of cancer-related complications, according to an official family statement provided to The Associated Press by the Dallas-based production company Warner Bros.
“Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he loved most,” his family said in a statement.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
“Linda Gray, who represented his wife in both the original and new series, was with Hagman at the time of his death at the Dallas hospital,” her agent Jeffrey Lane said in a statement.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind and talented and I will miss him terribly.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he admitted to drinking heavily for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver and Hagman underwent a transplant.
Years before the Dallas series aired, Hagman made a name for himself on television as a decent guy in NBC's light comedy I Dream of Jeannie from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is changed when he meets an attractive girl (Gina), played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to his house to live together.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His acting in films included roles that were well received by critics: The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was Hangman’s mastery of the incredibly repulsive J.R. that led him to stardom.
A CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other personalities around them aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The propaganda slogan "Who Shot Jayar?", which was supposed to raise expectations for an emotional piece where Hangman's character is almost murdered, caused not only a huge number of spectator speculations around the world, but also millions of dollars in betting offices.
This also helped to set a record for this work.
The November 1980 episode, in which the answer was revealed, was watched by an average of 41 million television viewers, making Dallas the second-most-watched entertainment show in history after MASH in 1983, which was watched by 50 million viewers.
His sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) shot at J.R.
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant and he threatened to call her a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, an insatiable greedy man with a charismatic smile: a deceitful businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) locked up in a hospital.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the headstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on screen and off."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who have been lucky enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas series aired on TNT a few months ago with great success.
"Five episodes of the second season have already been completed and the sixth was just being filmed," the network said in a statement.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there were no statements from Warner or TNT about how the series would continue.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth to Larry in 1931, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
At the beginning of the 1950s, Larry tried his luck on the stage in New York, and then from 1952 to 1956 he served in the Air Force in England.
There he met a young Swedish designer, Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and have lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he published his autobiography Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything in there that I knew would hurt anyone or hurt them in any way," he told the Prensa Asociada news agency at the time.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital, where he helped fearful patients.
“I advise them, I give them courage, I meet them when they go into surgery and after,” he said in 1996.
I try to give them comfort in the sense of "do not worry, it will be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you will be healthy."
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Begins a course that explores "the end of the world"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to take a course on the end of the world this semester, he knew it was an irresistible lure: The end of the "long count" of the Mayan calendar, due on December 21, caught many people as proof that the end of the world was coming.
Charmé, however, had no idea what lay ahead for him in the next few months: Hurricane Sandy, the budget chasm that some call “debt Armageddon,” and the growing conflict that Israel is drawn into, a place where, according to Christians theorizing about the end of the world, the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey, this week.
When you look at what’s going on in the world today as if we have 30 days left, it’s a really good time.
And remember, bad means good for apocalyptic thinkers.
And it’s not the only professor offering courses on “the end of the world” this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
Barry Vacker, an assistant professor at Temple University, is giving a course on “Means, Culture, and the End of the World.”
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We discuss why these ideas spread over time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behavior.
If, for example, nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, war can break out.
This month, students analyze films with apocalyptic themes and examine how they differ from real-life examples.
“I tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, plausible and impossible,” Vacker says.
At the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of art history and anthropology, came together to organize a course simply called The End of the World.
“We don’t attach ‘2012’ because we always expect to be able to re-organise the course in case the world doesn’t end,” Restall said.
Despite the "threatening doom" students have to study, create projects and do final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, giving students no choice but to work “until the evening of the supposed end of the world,” Restall said.
The courses have become quite popular.
"It stretched out to two hours," Restall said of his course for high-average students, 35 of whom applied.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, we received e-mails asking if there was still room.
The students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old religion and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers University in Camden.
Thus, apocalyptic, secular, or religious thinking is only a matter of comfort or lack thereof.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of an hour where it could be taught," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no student interviewed, let alone the professor, said he believed in the end date of December 21.
“Our first project dealt with Mayan predictions, and in a way we refute them,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior student at Temple University in West Chester.
"The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that in Western culture there is an apocalyptic anxiety that goes back several centuries, which people react to changes in their surroundings with predictions of the end of the world.
The rise of these speculations has been fueled by the Internet.
"Other people don't think about it," he said.
This is the case in the vast majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who is lecturing in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew of a course on the “end of the world.”
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, suggesting an exception at the highest office.
We have the grace of the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years, there has been talk of many days of final judgment, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, “people will immediately start thinking about the next date” or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will end.
The date is taken lightly by students and professors.
Several have said they intend to go to the "end of the world" celebration.
"I think I'll call a few friends and we'll laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
