The social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The amendments provide for the preservation of the travel allowance in public passenger transport.
From September 24, the procedure for organizing preferential travel of citizens using the social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is changing.
According to the press service of the Russian government in the Ivanovo region, the changes provide for the preservation of the benefit for travel in public passenger transport and bring the scheme of mutual settlements on the social card in accordance with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 of the Federal Law "On the National Payment System".
At the same time, the social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions of its application are changing.
Thus, the limit of replenishment is now set not in travel, as before, but in the amount of money, with the preservation of winter and summer periods - no more than 400 rubles in winter, in the summer period - no more than 800 rubles for the current month.
Now the holders of a social card on the receipts issued in transport will need to track not the number of remaining trips, but the balance of funds.
The cost of preferential travel for citizens will be 1/2 of the tariff valid at the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of travel is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The schedule of replenishment of the social card with money remains the same - in the period from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new order of travel on the social map will have a number of advantages.
Thus, it is possible to keep a detailed record of the expenditure of funds on the social card with accuracy to kopecks.
In addition, it is possible to return the credited, but unspent funds.
We also add that the scheme of mutual settlements with carriers becomes transparent, since now half the cost of travel is paid by the citizen, and the same amount is reimbursed to the carrier by the budget.
No commission will be charged when depositing money on the card.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, Deputy Head of the Department of Roads and Transport of the Ivanovo Region, said that in 2014, more than 33 million trips were made in the region using a social map, in 2015 - almost 25 million trips.
The regional budget for the provision of preferential travel of citizens using a social card provides for more than 470 million rubles.
As of September 1, the amount of compensation for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
During a 911 call, a teacher confesses to the murder of a friend.
During a 911 call, Shannon Lamb, a teacher at the university, told police that he had shot his girlfriend and that he needed staff to come to their home.
Lamb said there was a "dog" in the house who was alive but probably upset, and said the family's contacts could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a note casually written by hand on a white sheet of lined paper: "I'm sorry, I wish I could take it all back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," the note said, according to authorities signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the University of the State of Delta in Cleveland, Mississippi, had driven 300 miles to the university campus by then, where police believe he shot respected history teacher Ethan Schmidt on the doorstep of his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynne Buford said the university learned of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that truthful 911 call shortly thereafter.
By the end of the day, the victims will be one more: Lamb killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the school forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, the authorities were still trying to piece together the motives that motivated Lamb.
The information shared by investigators in both parts of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped paint a portrait of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to their classes.
Police in Gauthier, where Prentiss was killed, said there were no allegations of violence or criminal cases.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote in which he expressed his appreciation for the "beautiful people" with whom he had met in his teaching life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 faculty members, and many students attended lectures by both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for the emergence of problems.
One student who spoke well of Lambe, Brandon Beavers, reported that he also seemed anxious and nervous, "as if there was something wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb, at the end of the 2014-15 school year, told him about how he struggled with stress.
Lamb had earlier asked Delta State University to grant him sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university’s admissions rules meant that the doctorate Lamb had worked so hard to obtain would not guarantee him an automatic teaching position.
University President William Laforge said he knew nothing about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "apparently Mr. Lamb had something on his mind."
These are questions that Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
Police attacked Lamb's trail after his escape from campus as he was heading back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber single-shot pistol in the backyard of his home, one mile south of his parents' home in suburban Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Metell Johnson said.
His engine was still on the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb had come to the house, although Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in the city with a population of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogical sciences in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and cheerful man.
Carla Hearston said she was 15 and Lambu was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a cool older guy who for several years tried to teach her how to play the guitar.
In those years, he enjoyed success with women.
All the girls were melting when he was around,” says Hayrston, 40, who lives in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.
During a 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there is no record of their marriage being registered.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gauthier in a brick house, the back of which faces the canal.
According to the police, the dog is fine.
Prentiss’ ex-husband Sean O’Stin said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and that they have a daughter who is now 19.
"She's totally depressed," O'Stin said of her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he had not met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail were both performing at the same summer festival three years ago.
They played together from time to time at concerts.
O'Stin said that his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentice was a nurse and worked online for various companies.
Mike Schaffer, the bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at the dimly lit The Julep Room bar in the Gauthier suburb, said the last time he saw Lamb and Prentiss was on the evening of September 5, when Lamb finished playing guitar and harmonica for the few visitors.
There was nothing suspicious.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We had fun and made fun of each other.
I mean, they were both very witty.
“Schmidt, the deceased teacher, conducted first-year seminars and specialized in the history of Native Americans and colonial America,” said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same institution.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Kansas State University in Emporia and was president of the student fraternity and student self-government.
On the campus of the University of the State of Delta in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university faculty, staff, students and community members, participated in a memorial candlelight ceremony.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
“We are trying to get our students back,” Laforge said.
The crisis is over.
Today is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report was produced by Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was redacted in connection with the police statement that Lamb's call was received by 911 after Schmidt's murder, and in connection with the fact that although Lamb spoke of Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, the information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it won’t hire as many workers for the holiday season as it did last year, with the toy and children’s goods retailer saying it will give full-time staff and temporary workers the opportunity to work more hours.
The company says it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and wholesale bases across the country, down from the 45,000 it hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company said it will begin interviewing applicants this month and will increase its staff from October to December.
Although there are still a few months before the holidays, the shopping season is getting closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees in order to have enough staff in stores and on the sale, shipment and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about ‘dating’ Princess Diana
The premiere of the film “Back to the Future” turned out to be a grand event for Michael J. Fox.
It was also notable for personal reasons.
“We were sitting in the cinema waiting for the royals to arrive, I noticed that the seat next to me was free, and then it dawned on me that Princess Diana would be sitting next to me,” he said in the trailer for the soon-to-be-released documentary Back in Time.
The film begins, and then it occurs to me that I am literally at arm's length and in one false yawn from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time, a documentary about Back in the Future, includes interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The movie “Back to the Future” was released 30 years ago.
“For me,” Spielberg says, “this is undoubtedly the greatest time travel movie ever made.”
Back in Time will be available on VOD, DVD and in some cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says in response to Russia’s military support for Syria that there is “no military solution” to the nearly five-year-old conflict, and the growth of weapons will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN chief again called on all participants, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a news conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent council members – the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France – during this month’s General Assembly ministerial session to discuss Syria.
He expressed regret that disagreements in the council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, “made the situation unsolvable.”
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they showed in addressing the issue of the nuclear program on Iran and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 Poll Results That Show Donald Trump Is Not Joking
Some tried to label him as a provocateur.
Others shrugged it off as a joke.
Some want a scandal.
But no matter how some Republicans try to shake the high position of Donald Trump in the results of the polls, they have not succeeded (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump’s advantage in double digits, and some are beginning to seriously ask what this means for the real estate mogul in terms of the chances of getting a nomination.
Of course, this is only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to be nominated by the Republican Party.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry ceded his advantage to the gaining popularity of Herman Kane, none of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in a general election.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush’s “Political Activity Super Committee” and the economic conservative Club of Growth recognize Trump’s unrelenting power and begin to pull out their dollars to topple him.
Here are some survey numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just an intermediate phase:
The ratings of sympathy for Trump turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll at Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans were positive about the real estate tycoon.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Now six out of 10 Republicans are positive about Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators prevail in the initial stages.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there are positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of those voting for the GOP would see Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either “enthusiastic” or “satisfying” if Trump became a candidate.
Only two in 10 say they would be “disappointed” if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be “enthusiastic” against 40 percent of those who say the same about Trump).
The next level of excitement?
Marco Rubio, who has only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they would be “not satisfied” or “disappointed” if establishment favorite Jeb Bush becomes a candidate.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Trump is widely criticized for his praise and insults, 52 percent of Republican-leaning voters across the country think the tycoon has the right temperament to be president, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll on Monday.
The same figure appears at the nation’s first closed assembly in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the same man who could be commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he’s not the kind of person who can be effective in office, and nearly six in 10 independent voters say his temperament isn’t right for the White House, according to ABC/Post reports.
Republicans are getting used to this idea.
When they put on their expert hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
When asked who the most likely GOP winner was, four out of 10 said Trump was the favorite, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That’s no longer the case when four out of 10 put Jeb Bush on the run at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters didn’t have the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the last cycle of the cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported the possible candidate Mitt Romney.
Still, it shows that many GOP voters find Trump’s campaign persuasive.
Even if Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump was still ahead of everyone else.
Some pundits point out that such a spread is likely to play into Trump’s advantage, and at the same time those who do not support Trump are evenly distributed among the more than a dozen other candidates who do.
But a poll conducted by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical one-on-one contest between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets the support of the majority.
He beat Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Cassich and Chris Christie by 33 points.
He's got a tie with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson overtook the businessman by as much as 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one competition.
Just over half of Donald Trump’s supporters say they’ve changed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll conducted on Tuesday shows that only more than half of voters supporting Trump say they are confident in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.
46% say they leave the door open for other candidates.
Still, Trump’s most intense competition at the moment is with fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they’ve changed their minds are likely to pick Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump described Mexican immigrants as “rapists” two months ago in his campaign speech, the topic of immigration has become the most relevant in conversations in 2016.
Some worry that Trump’s posturing will distract key Latin American voters from the Republican Party and hinder rebranding.
But according to an ABC/Post poll conducted on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration is getting everyone’s attention, it looks like Donald Trump will stay in the same position.
Disappointment from the government is gaining momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now count on the support of about half of Republican voters, mainly because of their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans on Monday said in a new ABC/Post poll that they would rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they are also offended by Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa two weeks ago found that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed with Republican activity in Congress, with 54 percent “dissatisfied” and 21 percent “angry.”
The government will decide the fate of pension indexations in October.
Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets said that the government is now looking for options for the implementation of the law on indexation of pensions in 2016 to the real level of inflation.
She noted that a solution should be found by October 8, by the time the draft budget for the next year is submitted to the government.
In addition, the Cabinet is discussing the option of prolonging the decision to freeze the funded pension of Russians.
Golodets noted that the amount of pension savings is 350 billion rubles.
The indexation of pensions in full for the next year is about the same.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there is no final decision on who should pay contributions for non-working citizens.
Golodets believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong, at the same time, to socially vulnerable categories of citizens, it is not entirely fair that society pays for him.
Earlier, the media reported that the Cabinet is considering two options for balancing the state budget.
Why are the eyelids often irritated and reddened?
Answers the ophthalmologist Tatiana Levashova:
Our eyelids are screens that protect the eyeball from the many small particles that settle on them.
Forgetting about regular cleaning of the eyelids, we often ourselves contribute to the development of blepharitis.
The way out is simple:
do not rub your eyes with dirty hands, wear a special wet wipe for the eyelids;
At least 1-2 times a day, clean the edges of the eyelids from the accumulated harmful substances in them per day.
Cleansing procedures should be supplemented with warm compresses with decoctions of medicinal herbs (salfey, chamomile), liquefying the thick secretion of the sebaceous glands, and then massage the edges of the eyelids, which should be carried out with circular movements of the pads of the fingers;
washing off makeup, do not use alcohol-containing means.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and contribute to an even greater thickening of the secret of the sebaceous glands.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclear engineers have created an atomic warhead.
North Korea says its main nuclear reactor, the Yongbyon nuclear complex, is operating "at full capacity."
This was reported on the website of the Central Telegraph Agency of the country.
North Korea is ready at any time to respond to the “aggression and nuclear threat of the United States”, and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “both in quantity and quality”.
The last nuclear test was conducted by North Korea in 2013.
At the same time, plans to resume full-fledged operation of the reactor have not been reported since.
Pyongyang claims to have built an atomic warhead.
Also, the DPRK has repeatedly tested medium- and short-range missiles, writes polit.ru.
Zhirinovsky demanded to remove from the Russian anthem the mention of fraternal peoples.
LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that the mention of the union of fraternal peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
He said this during a meeting of the state Duma, reports "Russian news service".
Who are these people now?
Fascists and murderers!
“A very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletes can’t stand it,” Zhirinovsky said.
The deputy believes that it is necessary to remove all the quatrains that contain this line:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky said that the current anthem should be changed to "God Save the Tsar", and the Russian tricolor replaced with the imperial flag.
Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is sure that if Europe wants to deal with the problem of refugees, they should stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not whether Europe accepts or does not accept refugees, but whether the root causes of the problem need to be addressed.
If Europeans care about refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
That is our opinion on this issue.
“That’s the essence of the refugee issue,” he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue for the sake of consensus.
However, if we want real successes, they are impossible as long as people are killed, as long as the bloodshed continues, and as long as people do not feel completely safe.
“So we can reach a consensus, but we can’t implement anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria,” Assad said.
We will remind, in the EU countries for this year arrived about 500 thousand migrants, including - from Syria.
The European Commission says the current migration crisis is the biggest since World War II.
It is possible that among the migrants arriving in Europe may be thousands of militants of the extremist group “Islamic state”.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia can use the situation to create their cells in the EU to conduct terrorist activities.
Residents of the German city held a holiday for refugees.
Over the past month, Germany has become a leader in hosting refugees, although it has recently stepped up border controls to contain their influx.
Some 800,000 migrants are expected to arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts say the numbers are significantly higher.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
BBC correspondent Jenny Hill visited the city of Darmstadt, whose residents give migrants a very warm welcome.
Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut in the Prime Minister's Questions session
After the election of Mr. Corbyn, his debut at the session of the Prime Minister is expected with great impatience.
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will soon be addressing the Prime Minister for the first time, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will address the first of the six questions in the afternoon; his statement is likely to be closely followed by the press and Labour MPs.
He called for “less theatre and more facts” at a weekly demonstration speech.
He also said he might miss some meetings, leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr Corbyn’s first parliamentary test as leader; it will take place after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Trade Union Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Labour’s decision to stand silent while the national anthem is sung on Tuesday, during the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, has drawn criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and has been the subject of several front-page articles in newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he was "standing in respectful silence" and acknowledged "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
However, Mr Corbyn’s shadow cabinet member Owen Smith told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem “regardless” of his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to play on Mr Corbyn’s team, voicing disagreements on economic, defence and international politics, while fewer than one-sixth of members of the parliamentary party backed him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brandt says political disagreements are also “swelling” in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn’s appointment to the European Union and the government’s restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr Corbyn told the Trade Union Conference that the Labour Party had made amendments aimed at abolishing the very idea of restrictions in general.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow Labour and Pensions Minister, said there was "complete clarity" in the party that it was in opposition only to the government's plans to reduce the ceiling from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron will meet at the "courier box" in the ten years since he became Conservative Party leader.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has "engaged collective resources" to gather ideas on Mr Cameron's issues and received more than 30,000 proposals.
Islington North, a member of Parliament, said the Prime Minister’s questions were unnecessarily confrontational and that he would refrain from witty replies and exchanges of guts, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the problems facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said Angela Eagle, the economy minister in the shadow cabinet, would replace him on questions from the prime minister when he was away – for example, when Mr Cameron was abroad.
He also floated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor when possible, saying he had approached House of Commons Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue.
After becoming leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the political style of “fair mess” often associated with the prime minister’s question procedure, but admitted a few years later that he had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, questions to the prime minister have become a key indicator of the leader’s views, their ability to manage the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of parliament, although critics say it has turned into a caricature and requires sweeping reforms.
"Filmed in Yoburg" Homeless young people who learned to be photographers
The business center of Johannesburg is a difficult place for the homeless.
But one group of former homeless found a way to master the craft and earn a living.
“I Was Shot in Yoburg” is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take photos of the surrounding area and make money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.

The pound sterling is growing as wages rise in the UK
The pound rose against the backdrop of wage growth in the UK, while the FTSE 100 index rose thanks to the offer to buy SABMiller.
From May to June, earnings in the UK, minus bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate was the highest since 2009, and was met as a postponement of forecasts for possible growth of quotations.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505, and by 0.84% against the euro to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
Against the general background, SABMiller shares stood out, which grew by 20% thanks to a purchase offer from competitor AB InBev.
The deal would merge the world’s two largest brewers, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Shares of Burberry rose 0.9% amid encouraging news from a rival group of luxury goods manufacturers Richemont.
The latest Richemont sales figures exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China – a key market for Burberry – began to grow again.
Shares of Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said it had managed to raise $2.5 billion through the stock offering, which was done as part of a debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the paper and packaging group Mondi were the leaders in the fall in the index - by 4.3% - after Goldman Sachs lowered the group's rating to "sell".
Shares of JD Sports rose after the sportswear company reported an 83% rise in pre-tax profits for the six-month period to <0xC2><0xA3>46.6m.
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Salaries May Prevent Expansion
JD Sports chief executive Peter Cowgill says raising the minimum wage for British workers means “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But such purchasing power is unlikely to outweigh the increase in labor costs, he says.
Costs could affect plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash launches bottom-up initiative to fight Aldi’s onslaught
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the onslaught of Aldi in South Australia and Western Australia.
The bottom-up wholesale food supplier has launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in light of Aldi’s upcoming $700 million infusion.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and promoting the IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social media and at events like the Adelaide Show.
The campaign is being joined by retailers and IGA suppliers, such as Simmo’s ice cream maker from Dunsborough, which offers tastings at IGA stores, and store owners selling tickets to South Australian Football League matches at a discount to regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its protection strategy on September 29, the day this wholesale supplier of food, spirits and household goods will conduct its annual investor strategy day.
The stakes are high, as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30% of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are known to adhere to the usual routes, so the market here is more favorable for IGA retailers than in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in the South and 24 percent in WA compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take 5 percent of the food market in the two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking the volume of sales from all players present, but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report released this week, Tom Kirat, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, achieving sales of $500 million and $600 million in these markets, respectively.
The loss of revenue and sales of food products at a high level of constant costs Metcash can cost the company about 13 million income before interest and taxes, said Mr. Kirat.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly due to Aldi and Coles, and this despite the fact that a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal customers.
Morgan Stanley believes Metcash’s food sales will fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the company’s market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash “could disappear with a high probability within a decade.
Metcash declined to publicly comment on Mr. Douglass’ comments.
But a member of Metcash’s board of directors is believed to have contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and Metcash’s revenue from its food business, which it supplies to approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen 43 percent from 2012 due to operational deleveraging and pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not give up, spending more than $150 million annually to equalize retail prices with the prices in Coles and Woolworths for a thousand positions per week and helping IGA retailers in the reorganization of retail outlets, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider selection of branded foods.
Metcash CEO Ian Morris says that price equalization and refurbishment of retail space is gaining momentum, and he hopes the company will achieve an increase in net profit in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves respect, not criticism for his behavior.
Tanasi Kokkinakis was indirectly hurt in the recent scandal surrounding his friend Nick Kiryos and deserves more credit for his behavior than critics, according to Tennis Australia President Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, Jr. in the talented duo and often called "Special Ks", was unwittingly in the spotlight because of the shameful altercation of Kiryos with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly after, during a hot qualifying match in Cincinnati, the judge on the tower had to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, with Harrison stating, "Wawrinka had to put on the blades of Kiryos, and I have to put on the blades of this guy."
Since Kokkinakis was last seen breaking a racket after a convulsion in his leg saved Richard Gaske from a possible defeat at the US Open, Healy has loyally defended Kokkinakis.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the right to be second after Bernard Tomich in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Great Britain.
“I’m very worried about one thing, which is that Tanasi has been drawn into the conflict,” Healy said.
He did break his racket when he lost his leg at the US Open, but he’s not the first player to break his racket when hopes were dashed, and I know Tanasi well enough to be sure he wouldn’t be proud of it.
But he actually handled himself very well in rather provocative situations in the US, with Harrison, etc., and I’m sure he’s trustworthy.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family, and I just think he's been treated a little unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old man, he works a lot, fits in well with the team, he has never had problems with other players, he is respected outside the court, he is intensively trained, he is in great shape, he is a very purposeful and developed young man, and I think he should be appreciated.
Healy also backed the decision to forgive Kyrgios for an important match starting on Friday, believing "mutual consent" was the right way out for everyone but hoping the Canberra guy would return to the team as a long-term player.
“First of all, we want the team to focus fully on the match, not the controversy around [Kirios],” Healy said.
And I think Nick has gotten stronger very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray prove, he's growing up in front of the public, he's made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to help him realize the consequences of his actions, and it's necessary, I think, to take him out of the spotlight for a while so that he can think best for them, and that's the best.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes the border, detains migrants
By declaring a state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday blocked the border with Serbia on the southern border and is detaining those trying to enter the country illegally in order to contain the inflow of migrants.
There were riots on the border - hundreds of migrants gathered in the border area, to which the Serbian authorities reacted sharply negatively.
Stuck indefinitely on a stretch of road between the two countries’ checkpoints, people fleeing armed violence in their homeland pitched tents and settled in the area.
However, discontent has increased.
As a police helicopter circled over them, migrants shouted “Open the border!” and shouted insults at the Hungarian special police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia’s foreign minister has declared it “unacceptable” to expel migrants back from Hungary as more and more of them arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution to the problem, not collateral damage.
It is necessary to hold talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days,” Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border began a day after a bloc of 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to be jointly responsible for 40,000 asylum seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that an agreement will be reached in the future (next month or by the end of the year) under which EU member states will take in another 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded an emergency EU summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis sweeping the continent.
Hungary, however, does not expect swift action from Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in the two southern regions gave authorities more authority to act on the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum court cases.
Meanwhile, Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country was also planning to erect a barbed-wire fence on a section of the border with Romania to block the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has completed a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even the prisoners were connected to the urgent work to complete the fence of barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main “narrow spot” and border crossing point of the European Union for migrants, many of whom are refugees – victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that the majority of people arriving in the country are economic migrants looking for a better life, and not refugees - victims of hostilities who have the right to protection, and this point of view is sharply different from the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force in Hungary at midnight, now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-meter (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and also include longer prison terms for those accused of human trafficking.
“Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency,” government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We make it clear that crossing the border illegally is a crime.
Formally, parliament still has to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters who are at the border have been observing the presence of heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs there for several days.
Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rgy Bacondi, Orban’s national security adviser, said 45 people had been caught trying to cross the border at the border and 15 others had been apprehended inside the country.
They crossed the border, broke the fence, are currently in police custody and are accused of committing administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities are quickly restoring the fence.
Hungarian authorities on Tuesday morning also closed two of the seven passages on the border with Serbia, driving a railway car wrapped in barbed wire to block one of the passages.
Riots broke out on the main border passage near the city of R<0xC3><0xB6>szke (Hungary), as Hungarians placed a service room for people to pass inside a metal container, and crowds of people pressed each other to break through inside.
About 20 people managed to get inside, while thousands of people remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway leading from Serbia to Hungary and announced a refusal of food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Bernard Sanders halved in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton now has 47 percent support among Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), and Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to run for president, gets the support of 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the primaries, most Democratic voters say it’s too early to say they’ve decided which candidate to support.
Clinton’s supporters are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since a CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost the support of some demographic groups, and Sanders has earned some bonuses.
Clinton retains a great advantage among women and moderates, but that advantage has declined.
Her support among men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind her.
The preference given to Clinton by Democratic voters under 50 has disappeared, and she and Sanders are now on an equal footing.
However, Clinton still has a big advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton overtook Sanders by a double-digit number among liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.
Nearly half of Democratic primary voters across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the party’s candidate.
A quarter would have supported her with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would have supported her just because she was a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters are likely to be more enthusiastic about her.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, views are more controversial — only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked the open question of why they want to see her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), then that it is now time for a female president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the post (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also talk about an association linking her to Bill Clinton (9%).
It is also called agreement on issues and chances of election.
As the vice president contemplates potential electoral participation, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like him to join the race — though a third believe he should not.
When asked who they would like to see in second place among the party’s candidates, the Democratic primary is often referred to as Biden.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half said they would choose Biden second, more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among the participants of the race to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that figure dropped from 78 percent last month.
By this indicator, Biden is in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate has increased.
However, answering the question of what is most important in a candidate, Democratic voters choose other options than the chances of being elected.
Similar to the situation last month, none of the Democratic candidates or potential candidates is an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have performed well on some key characteristics among their party’s primary voters.
Most believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Of the three, Biden leads by integrity, and Clinton’s strength is in her leadership qualities.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have a definite opinion about him in this regard.
Primary Democratic voters also generally view Clinton, Sanders, and Biden’s ideological views as similar.
By all these measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
While questions about Hillary Clinton’s personal email box and server as Secretary of State continue, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation and believe that this has not negatively affected their overall opinion of her.
But that’s a different story for the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans today are dissatisfied with her explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion about this was divided back in March, shortly after the story became known.
A majority of Americans say the email controversy has had no impact on their overall opinion of Clinton, though 36 percent say their opinion of her has worsened.
It’s mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10, who claim their opinion of Clinton has worsened.
Even though Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by her party voters, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent consider her honest and trustworthy, eight points lower than last month, and 15 points lower than May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not consider it fair and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not consider Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, both get good marks in leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush showed the best results in honesty.
Most see Sanders as more of an honest man than not, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
According to the results of the national survey, Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump
Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS/New York Times poll
The two candidates won half the vote in a new poll, leaving everyone else in search of a foothold.
Republican voters across the country continue to massively support Trump, whose percentage of support has increased from 23 percent in a recent CBS poll conducted on the eve of the Fox News debate last month, to 27 percent in a poll conducted on Tuesday.
But Carson took off in the same period from 6% to 23%.
The poll also showed that Carson enjoys support across all demographic groups, pushing Trump into the group of Republican voters with higher education.
The other candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, have rolled back with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, whose support has fallen from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio come in third with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6%, the poll was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson’s growth in polls – showing support 19% among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll also found that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
In light of Carson’s growing support last week, Trump made several critical remarks against the former neurosurgeon, even as Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during the closing of the Iowa campaign.
Five Brotherhood Members Charged With Death of Baruch College freshman
About two years after the death of a college student during a initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
“Members of the P. Delta Psi fraternity from New York’s Baruch College brutally attacked Chan “Michael” Deng during the initiation ceremony in September 2013 and failed to get him to the hospital on time, which resulted in his death,” police said.
Officials say the blindfolded student and a 30-pound backpack with sand on his back were pushed several times as he tried to reach the target while walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the P.D. Psi fraternity did not call 911 when Deng passed out, and waited presumably an hour before taking him to the hospital, police said.
They did, however, take the time to change Deng’s clothes, find his symptoms in Google, and contact Andy Meng, the Brotherhood’s national president, to ask for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
“At this point, the members of the fraternity began to hide personal property, essentially putting the well-being of the fraternity above Michael Deng’s health,” Chief Wagner said.
He could not be saved and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng sustained several blunt force traumas to the head, torso, and thighs.
“Too many families have suffered as a result of initiation rituals in the brotherhood, as at least one student has died during them every year since 1970,” Douglas Fireberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
The fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is very important.
The Monroe jurors bowed in favor of charges of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Meng, will be charged with rookie abuse and criminal conspiracy.
“We want to bring to justice not only individual participants, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned all this officially or unofficially, then so is it,” Wagner told a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College forbade the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood excluded the local branch from its structure.
What will happen when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates?
There will be an increase in rates, and the “bull market” will stumble, bond yields will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we don’t know is how long it will take before the offensive, and how long it will last.
For the economy in particular, history explains little about time.
The recession came just 11 months after the first rate hike and for a full 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s rigidity in raising rates often, though not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
That’s why the U.S. central bank administration has been so insistent that investors should not focus on when it starts raising rates, but on how long it will take to adjust.
In fact, there are many variables in the game.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the fuss about raising rates is exaggerated.
“The Federal Reserve’s first rate hike with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the ‘cheap money’ era,” Julian Jessop, chief international economist at Capital Economics, said in a commentary for clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here’s a look at how some areas of the economy might have reacted depending on historical trends:
As the market has seen over the past month or so, waiting for rates to rise can lead to volatility for a while.
When you raise the rate, however, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
“It does not appear that equity earnings have slowed for 12-24 months after the first jump, which, again, probably reflects a delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes.
More specifically, the market has changed dramatically over the past 35 years—about 14 percent—in the direction of rate hikes, remains fairly flat for 250 days thereafter (average growth of 2.6 percent), then, after 500 days, returns to normal with an average return of 14.4 percent over the past six cycles, according to a recent analysis conducted by Bob Doll, chief public strategist for Nuve’s stock trading strategy.
Deutsche says that the result for securities tends not to immediately become more pronounced at the rate hike stage, and equity earnings are starting to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often play into them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed in conditions that did not exist before and can accelerate the recession.
Basically, the gross domestic product will be at almost its lowest point in the existence of an increased rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases of rate hikes since 1950, only twice the nominal annual GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few people believe that it will be for a long time, despite the fact that in the third quarter it remained at only 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates on such an unstable economic background can be risky and raises the question of “will this time be different,” Deutsche said.
Market participants are preparing to raise rates by the Federal Reserve throughout the year, while their eyes are riveted to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could have approved the rate hike at this meeting, futures trading is only a 25 percent chance.
“In our study, since 1950, all the cycles of rate hikes to date have been in a supercycle of increasing financial leverage with GDP closing the peaks pre-recession, very soon after the start of the recovery,” the report said.
By contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery from the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle is the longest that the Federal Reserve has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, in total it lasts for 74 months and is not yet over.
Fixed income has also become volatile while the market expects rates to rise, and this scenario is somewhat similar to the one that is being implemented for stocks.
The fundamental difference is that the effect for bonds will come faster than for stocks, when the Federal system changes the strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it seems that the yield changes the vector immediately after the first rate increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the rate hike cycle, bond yields immediately fall,” Deutsche said.
Strategy experts at Charles Schwab believe that raising rates will cause long-term and short-term bond yields to converge, making the curve flatter.
High-yield bonds often perform better in such a climate, though “we are still wary of yield swings,” said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expected results of the policy of the Federal system.
“In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of a tighter monetary policy,” she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have expanded, volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market with the tightening of the policy of the Federal system.
Generally speaking, companies doing their main business in the US will benefit from higher interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with a lot of debt will be in a worse position, as a growing dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space, and their debt is more expensive in the financial one.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks demonstrate above-market performance within three months of the initial rate hike,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Firms with a stable financial position outperformed firms with an average of 5 percentage points for each rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high returns on capital, as well as stocks with low volatility, also showed better efficiency than low-quality stocks, on average by 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt will be a big issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating-rate debt will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely exchange-traded transactions, consumers will benefit from a growing dollar.
Investors could also see profits through higher returns, although experts differ on how quickly this will happen.
‘BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM,’ Conservative MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the station for "lowering standards"
Proves that it is becoming less and less different from a commercial competitor
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, saying the award was simply torn from Brits.
Parliament colleague Damien Collins, who slammed The Voice with the same criticism, was not original
"BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM," the leader of parliament said, urging the broadcaster to prove that it is doing at least something that commercial companies are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that the public radio station appeared to be “stupid” and becoming less distinguishable from its commercial rival.
“Radio 3 seems — I don’t like to use the word ‘simplification’ — but it seems to be turning into Classic FM,” he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something else, here are two examples that came to my mind first, in which you’re really just copying what’s already on the market,” Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC’s director-general has denied the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and audience education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I don’t learn about classical music anywhere else.
And his devotion to live performances and making music is not really comparable to anyone else.
“It’s also really important, I think, that Radio 3 is interested in finding new music and promoting new works,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davy argued that the radio station has to work much harder to attract audiences than in the past because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only child of the BBC, which was attacked for stepping on the heels of commercial competitors during the hearings of the special Committee on culture, media and sports.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a music talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch Talpa Media for an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
See why this program is often discussed in connection with the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, which features Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges, was made in a "typical BBC style".
He added that he wants the Corporation to “find a hit in her own home stable” the next time she launches an entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent ordering new seasons of The Voice in the future or using the money of those who pay the license fee for other entertainment formats.
The growth of Internet sales slowed as much as possible in August, and the reason for this may be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, there was a 7% increase in online sales.
Last month saw the slowest growth since it was first observed in 2000.
Online sales increased three years ago due to the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts are convinced that the November Black Friday could contribute to the containment of spending
For about a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, turning many of Britain’s central streets into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs of a leveling off of online sales, after the latest data showed only a 7% increase during the first three months of 2015.
Total spending on online shopping in August showed a minimal increase since they began to be recorded in 2000, increasing by only five percent.
Experts say there are now signs of leveling online sales, after the latest data showed only a 7% increase during the first three months of 2015.
“If you look at the growth rates in previous years and go back to 2000, they’ve always found a reasonable explanation,” Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago when shoppers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that even more people were able to shop online, and that they could do so in any setting, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it comes out on the plateau, and you can see the decline (growth).
The phenomenon of Black Friday, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying on the eve of the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, buyers five times the average rushed to the computers to have time to take advantage of profitable offers, thereby crashing a number of sellers’ websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers enter into a real battle for profitable purchases, could make people refrain from shopping.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, just over <0xC2><0xA3>1 out of every 5 is spent online.
As for products such as televisions and washing machines, more than one-third of them are sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online more willingly than in fashion stores on central streets.
Muslims bury dead in crane fall in Mecca, and Bin Laden family sanctioned
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead on the streets, as the first funerals begin in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blamed the accident on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The health ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims flocked to the streets to bury 29 of the victims of the crane collapse at Mecca’s main mosque.
Dressed mostly in white, those present at the funeral filled the carriageway to pay tribute to the first of the dead who went on their last journey to the cemetery of Al-Moaissem.
A sad procession passed by the sacred site, where just a few days earlier a construction crane had pierced the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the parishioners.
The bodies were handed over for burial, and at the same time the King of Saudi Arabia fined a construction company owned by bin Laden’s family for an accident that also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 parishioners who died in the collapse of the crane in the Main Mosque were carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage trip when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was at the Main Mosque with his parents before the annual Hajj.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj in Mecca will continue, as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
King Salman said today that Binladin Group should not have left the crane arrow raised when the crane is not working.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
The English edition of the news agency did not tell about this detail, but reported that the company's leaders were forbidden to travel outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the reason for the fall of the crane in the courtyard of the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flocked to this month to go to the hajj.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the crane collapse, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The royal decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and improper coordination of actions with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the main mosque of Mecca, as part of the large-scale construction work carried out by Binladin Group.
The bin Laden family has for decades been close to Saudi Arabia’s ruling family and oversees major construction projects.
The late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was the son of a traitor whom the family disowned in the 1990s.
The accident occurred amid strong winds and rain just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to take part in a pilgrimage that is mandatory at least once in a lifetime for every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remained in the hospital.
Officials ordered one million rials (about <0xC2><0xA3>174,000) to be paid to the relatives of the victims, and the same amount irretrievably mutilated.
The rest of the victims will receive half of this amount.
The head of B&Q claims that the trend is explained by the presence of Eastern European masters working for little money
According to Veronique Laurie, the British are increasingly hiring repair specialists
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is growing
The result is the opening of more than 200 new Screwfix stores for specialists
Kingfisher to close 60 B&Q stores across the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, chief city correspondent for the Daily Mail
It is said that the British put aside hammers and paintbrushes, and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to perform work in the house.
If you know how to handle a hammer or skillfully paint walls, it seems that these days you are in the minority.
Because, according to the company-owner of B&Q, the British are increasingly hiring specialists-masters to perform simple housework.
Veronique Laurie, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns the home improvement services network, said that behind this trend is a significant influx of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe, offering services at minimal prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in goods for craftsmen, and at the same time close 60 B&Q stores.
Ms. Laurie said she would like to see more women in B&Q store staff, as eight out of ten store shopping decisions are made by women.
Currently, the majority of staff are men.
According to her, it is impossible not to notice the latest demographic trends, characterized by the growing number of households consisting of single women who are more engaged in the arrangement of their homes than in the past.
Ms Lori said: “Our stores are still staffed primarily by men.
Steps must be taken to achieve balance.
Overall, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of purchasing decisions are made by women.
Women play an important role in decision-making.
Ms Laurie, one of five women at the helm of leading UK companies whose shares are listed on the FTSE100, has also changed the composition of the top management team, achieving an equal number of men and women among directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which exactly 50 percent of managers are women, including the CEO and CFO.
Ms Lori said: “It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding suitable women on the board of directors was not difficult.
After the group took over the costs of closing stores, Kingfisher showed a decline in profit and sales for six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns the Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new stores
Time of decision on the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching a meeting held by the Federal Reserve Bank, which for two days is discussing the adoption of the most important decision - to raise the interest rate for the first time in the last decade.
A Reuters poll of 80 economists found that just over half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would go for it last week now believe it will still stall and keep the rate at the current range of 0.25%.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve cut the rate to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching the fact that the main bank can move from zero and begin the process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, lead researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is working efficiently, the economic upturn adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision will affect the global economy.
He warned the markets that they should prepare for change, but everything speaks to their confidence that all chances are against such a step.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
A new Balkan route: refugees go to the EU through Croatia.
"Open!" chanted hundreds of refugees at the Horgos checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed the border for migrants.
Asylum seekers are already starting to probe other options for routes to the European Union.
One of them bypassing the closed border with Serbia lies through Romania.
The other - through Croatia and Slovenia - to Austria.
According to some reports, buses carrying refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the town of <0xC5><0xA0>idu on the Croatian border.
The drivers were ordered by the authorities to follow without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Neboj<0xC5><0xA1>a Stepanovi<0xC4><0x87> assures that his country is doing everything in its power to help refugees, but its capabilities are limited:
Our job is to keep Serbia as safe as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people, ensure that they are treated humanely.
This is already a European problem.
To solve it is not easy, no country in Europe alone will not cope with it, and especially such a small country as Serbia.
Belgrade is asking Budapest to open the border to refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is adamant:
If someone calls himself a refugee, he must fill in the necessary documents in Serbia.
And if he does not do this, then he will not be allowed into our country, because it is quite safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already built a 175-kilometer fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop there: he plans to erect a similar fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already said that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Meimarakis: “Europe wants to help us”
Vangelis Meimarakis has been a member of centre-right governments for a number of years, leading the country into what the left sees as a financial crisis.
Now, as the interim leader of the New Democracy party, he is challenging Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with journalist Euronews.
Euronews: Mr. Meimarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a crushing defeat, losing to the SYRIZA coalition, but now, according to polls, New Democracy is on par with it in popularity.
What has changed in that time?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and economic growth prospects.
Now the country again has a budget deficit and a high unemployment rate.
The investors left because Mr. Tsipras drove them out.
Over the past nine months, the Greeks have had an opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January, and the false promises of Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare what was promised with what actually happened.
Everyday life has become noticeably worse compared to January, when the situation improved, and this affected the majority of Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you say that if you win the elections, you will seek alliances with other parties, including SYRIZA.
Vangelis Meimarakis: The fact is that, as we have realized in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still being implemented, the political forces and all the ruling parties have come together to implement the programme on which they have agreed, without renouncing their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at this stage only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in support of the agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the country’s creditors.
If you become the new Prime Minister on Monday, will you abide by this agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Meimarakis: In fact, we voted for Greece’s move along the European path, because we have a good idea of the disastrous consequences that a country’s exit from the EU would have.
Now Europe is helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, the Juncker package and help in the banking sector.
All this would have been lost if there had not been a treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures are the result of the way Mr Tsipras negotiated.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government during the first year in power wants to restore order, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue program, then, I am sure, all the commitments that can not be fulfilled due to the fact that they lead to recession can again become the subject of negotiations, but only after a certain time.
It would be a mistake to believe that in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they expect the agreement to be fully implemented.
If we want to restore their trust, we must continue the privatisation, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed, while continuing to enjoy the benefits of EU funding and the great investment opportunities that we must open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Tsipras government did not present any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we found out when discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
Let me give you an example of the income of farmers.
We have explained to our European partners that we are not talking about a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the ministers of Tsipras never spoke about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were not prepared and poorly informed, and therefore unsuccessfully negotiated and concluded an unsuccessful agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon find yourself at the same table with Mr Juncker, Hollande, Mrs Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them be different from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, told them?
Vangelis Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that until the end of 2014, we were trying to implement the 2012 agreement in the best possible way, bypassing the sharp corners.
We have moved forward with reforms.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in extraordinary circumstances.
The market fell, and no potential buyers were visible, ready to pay the price that satisfied the Greek government.
I was the speaker of parliament at the time, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups that constituted the government majority at the time.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working parliament, in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations taking place outside.
And we managed to bring the country to a normal situation that would have continued to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the early general elections that resulted from the December presidential elections.
Euronews: There has been a massive influx of refugees in Greece in recent weeks.
What do you think about this situation and the reaction of European countries to which these people aspire?
Vangelis Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a time bomb that we will have to deal with after winning the elections.
And the reason is that the SYRIZA government did not act in this situation as it should have done.
In such matters, you should act ahead of time, because if the problem overtakes you, then only emergency measures remain.
And that's exactly the situation we're in now.
Even the interim government that replaced SYRIZA did more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the interim government, which is provided with valuable assistance by the president of the republic, who called for the EU summit, will allow to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and notice that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
They are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some extraordinary events that happened to them.
There is a deeply humanitarian dimension to this issue, and we will stick to the position that European politicians must adopt in this new situation.
The relevant decision should be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border controls and reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to cope with this pressing problem.
Euronews: Mr Meimarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful city of Druzhkivka, Donetsk region, during the day, the officers of the criminal investigation of the Main Directorate of Police of the region, together with the military counterintelligence, identified and detained the suspect, who turned out to be a 34-year-old Ukrainian serviceman from the city of Krivoy Rog (Dnepropetrovsk region), who the night before in the joint use of alcoholic beverages.
A 22-year-old boy was reported injured from a hospital where he was hospitalized with through gunshot wounds to his legs.
According to Artem Vasitsky, deputy head of the criminal investigation department of the police chief of the region, during the operational actions, law enforcement officers proved the involvement of the defendant in another serious criminal offense - the murder of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
Operatives found that on the same day, a conflict occurred between the suspect and another local resident, as a result of which he inflicted a fatal gunshot wound to the man's head.
The investigative department of the Druzhkovsky NGO opened criminal proceedings under the articles "Intentional murder" and "Intentional infliction of serious bodily harm" of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The detainee faces up to 15 years in prison.
The figure was detained and placed in temporary detention, the press service of the Donetsk region police said.
Two residents of Novosibirsk, who painted several Soviet monuments in the colors of the Ukrainian flag, including two monuments to Vladimir Lenin, have been sentenced to prison by a Russian court.
Two other residents of the city were sentenced to restriction of freedom.
The residents of Novosibirsk were sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years in prison.
Two other convicts were given 14- and 18-month prison sentences.
The Leninsky court of Novosibirsk found four citizens guilty of vandalism in relation to the monuments to Lenin, which were located on the territory of the regional committee of the Communist Party and on the street Knikotazhnaya, as well as the memorial complex "Monument of Glory".
In the latter case, the Katyusha missile launcher and the T-34 tank were painted.
We will remind, on the night of December 12 in the Russian Novosibirsk, unknown people painted in the colors of the Ukrainian flag military equipment at the Monument of Glory.
The civil wife of the popular Russian actor Evgeny Tsyganov Irina Leonova gave birth to the seventh child.
The girl was born in one of the Moscow clinics.
The newborn and her mother are doing well.
We will remind, recently Gypsies and Leonov broke up.
Eugene declined to comment.
Irina blames everything on her husband and his ambitions.
Yevgeny Tsyganov is 36 years old.
He is an actor of the Moscow theater "Workshop of Peter Fomenko".
He is known for the films "Walk", "Space as a hunch", "Brest Fortress", the series "Thaw" and "Farts".
On September 8, Evgeny Tsyganov was named “Actor of the Year” and “Person of the Year” according to the Russian version of the popular magazine GQ.
The man who opened fire at Delta State University left a note apologizing
After shooting and killing his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning — and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was “sorry” about the first murder and wanted “everything back,” authorities said on Tuesday.
Police in the city of Gauthier, Mississippi, said a geography and social science teacher at Delta State University called 911 about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he reported that he had shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police needed to send people to his house.
He said, “I killed my wife last night,” and also mentioned that there was a “dog” in the house that “would not touch anyone,” but was probably upset.
The police asked the name of the caller, but he did not name him.
Lamb did not explain why he opened fire.
Upon arrival at the scene, police found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, which read: "I'm sorry, I'd like to take it all back.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
Writing a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on Monday evening, when he was surrounded by police, committed suicide.
The university’s rector, William Laforge, said he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but “Mr. Lamb clearly had something on his mind.”
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb was suggesting a romance between Prentiss and Schmidt, officials on Tuesday reported "no information or evidence" of a "love triangle".
Prentiss was referred to as a "good man" by Sean O'Stin, who reported that he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O’Stin said he and Prentiss had a daughter, 19, and that she was “inconsolable.”
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were “best friends.”
According to Lindsay Knowles, whom the newspaper “San Herald” calls a close friend of Prentiss, the latter worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles revealed that Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lightning, and that she had dated Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "She's always wanted to help people."
According to police, Lamb on Monday at some point called relatives to say that "he will not go to prison."
In the evening of the same day, when the police caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself there.
According to the summary posted on the university website, in the spring of 2015, Lamb received a doctorate in pedagogy from the University of Delta.
The Stars Who Lost Their Fortunes
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), went through several difficult years.
In 2001, he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his longtime life companion Farrah Fawcett, who died of cancer.
The actor also reportedly suffered from drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly played a role.
Luke Shaw has been out of Manchester United for a few months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during a Champions League match in which Manchester United lost to PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender is worried about not being able to go on the pitch for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during Hector Moreno’s reckless rampage in the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV penalty area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and given oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture and he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or the day after, and then operated on.
“It’s terrible – a young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcame a lot of difficulties and started to play fantastically, and then it happened.
There was an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's for six months, and the guy can't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky that he did not receive a red card and was not given a penalty.
The referee, Nicola Rizzoli, didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal believes that the Italian judge made a mistake.
Judge for yourself when I say it's worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad ride with two legs.
In a tweet, Shaw wrote: “Thank you all for your messages, words not to describe how devastated I am, my journey to recovery begins, I will return even stronger than I was.”
Manchester United suffers misfortune with Luke Shaw after defeat in the game with PSV
The defender of the English will have an additional incentive to recover to the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Koku, PSV coach, said: “This is a very serious injury.
When any player is out with a similar injury, everyone is very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to injure the enemy.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when he played for Mexico against the Netherlands under Van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup.
“It’s very difficult for him now because he had no intention of hurting the enemy and when you hear that it’s a very serious injury, you feel bad,” he said.
I couldn’t see the moment myself.
The only thing I could see was a ball that was flying in the other direction, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched it, but I didn’t see a run for Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to endure.
It's very hard for me, and I'm so sorry.
Andres Guardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after a clash with Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about the Lorax?
Every parent learns one thing very quickly: if your child likes a book, it will be a while before you know it almost by heart.
Unless, of course, you're David Cameron.
Answering a question from a company that organizes children's holidays, about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose "Lorax" - a fairy tale with an environmental bias, written by Dr. Seuss in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a comment posted on SuperCamps’ website, and continues: “This fun, touching, unusual story with a strong message I love to read to my children, because it always reveals some image or message that we miss.”
And everything would be fine, except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to retell the content of the book, but actually tells the plot of the eponymous film, shot in 2012, with new characters and details added to diversify the rather short original narrative.
“In the high-walled town of Vsemnuzhville, where there was no greenery and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, fulfilling her desire to see a real tree,” reads a description of a love story unknown to Dr. Seuss (real name Theodore Seuss in 1991).
If that doesn’t sound suspicious enough, Cameron’s text reads almost like a summary of the Lorax movie plot, posted on the Internet Movie Database website: “In the high-walled city of Vsemnuzhville, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams.”
It seems unlikely that Cameron, being admittedly an active parent, is so unfamiliar with the contents of the book, in which an unnamed boy learns about how the environment is destroyed by a greedy tree-cutter and a knitter of the "all-monkey" Nakhodkins, who, despite the protests of Lorax (whose name is removed from the book) is named after him.
Most likely, such a simple PR task was entrusted to the performer, who had never read a book about Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was allegedly received from Cameron's office in the electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron’s headquarters, but no further comment was made.
For Adam Lit, there was clearly a risk of not making the England squad, but it’s still a difficult question.
Winning over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the team that England selected for this tour, repeating the defeat in the test series with a score of 3-0 that happened last time, it does not seem likely to me.
I wouldn’t rule out winning on my own field either.
Alistair Cook’s team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but it’s got some players with a virtuosic ball-handling and a strong collective mindset; they won’t bring the scars of 2012 with them, only the youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moen Ali turns into a bowler passing the twisted balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
Adam Litt dropped out of the England Test cricket team and was replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to expel Adam Litt for me, his head coach at Yorkshire, of course, is difficult to analyze.
His seven test matches had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the obvious but cruel reality is that cricket players are judged by the result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I’ve said this before) players choose themselves best.
The couple is half a century old, and Lita could have waited for a longer career, but he was at the mercy of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more injuries for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The England manager, Trevor Bayliss, spoke well about his mood, even when he didn’t show what he was capable of, and that doesn’t surprise me; he’s a team player first and then everything else.
The question of how long it will be before a test cricket batsman makes an impression is a difficult one.
Litt played in seven games, as did Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton in nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and on someone else's field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Litt was in the best shape, but this missed opportunity is already in the past.
Alex Hales shows up, and he's a batsman that I appreciate very much.
He is an unpredictable cricketer, which we saw at the Yorkshire club earlier this season when he earned 236 in a match against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.
He should at least be given the same opportunity as those who were before him, but it will, of course, depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea of putting Moen next to Cook as an opening batsman, which would give the opportunity to introduce an additional spinner, while keeping four speed bowlers, is being considered, and I'm not at all against it.
I don’t see why a player can’t hit the ball there, and this left-hander has already shown that he’s a damn good cricketer.
Moen may not be quite what you need for his county of Worcestershire, but he has become the third number for them, and there is no big difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 test matches as a “third batsman” before coming out as an opening act in 2001.
He won three hundred and didn’t look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the national team as a backup spinner, and during my short communication with him, he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People may look at his approximate stats — an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball — and think it’s a risky bet, but among the spinners voting “yes” a little, and the takers chose youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the national team, England plans to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayauordin, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for test matches, could be a masterful move.
He is one of the best guys for the game, which will bring to it the richest experience, obtained in all possible conditions and in any attacks.
Paul Collingwood is included in those games where the white ball is used, and will provide both energy and merciless pace in the set-up.
I always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it’s playing or coaching, and like Mahela, he has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what has already been said before, can give new strength to the team.
Collie's Durham team-mate Ben Stokes has been left for a day's work, Ruth has been given a similar break in Australia, and I have no problem with that, for example.
While not everyone will agree, coaches and players’ pickers don’t set a schedule.
And you have to remember how players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never taken lightly.
Britain’s exit camp could win if economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron’s ill-conceived policy of resuming negotiations to keep Britain in the EU is getting more and more complicated every day, even without looking back at the election of the brilliant Jeremy – “Is it yes or no?” – Corbyn as Labour leader or TUC’s outrage over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbins and Nigel Faragie.
A friendly European diplomat explained the other day that, given the state of the EU, which is now experiencing a variety of crises – not all of them of its own making – some member states are fed up with Britain’s egocentric agenda of divisive concessions and disruptive changes they largely do not want.
Gathering in Brighton for the annual meeting, TUC decided it didn’t want them anyway if they were ruining social protection.
We might even call it “Dave and George’s selfie program.”
The prime minister and finance minister ride summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photograph themselves against the backdrop of a famous local monument, in the company of a local celebrity or without it, then come home and say that they are attracting allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants Britain interested in maintaining external contacts under the awning of the European Union — “Don’t leave us together with France,” Berlin says — is proposing that foreign ministers and officials in some capitals come to an understanding when they don’t care whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany’s very cautious chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before the situation for her worsens, as she worsened for those sitting in her seat Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French President Francois Hollande faces re-election or a replacement in 2017.
It also loses its power.
Poland may soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It’s hard to see them crawling out of their skins to help “selfie Brits” whose energy could be spent on preventing Scotland’s exit from the UK – which they don’t want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even be planning to issue deliberately useless SNP-style papers during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to spur the UK’s exit from the EU, a friend of mine suggests.
“The revision was a fixation idea” and “Britain got nothing of value from the renegotiations.”
Europeans know to their chagrin what a predator Fleet Street can be, and how sceptical the media tycoons are of the EU, as opposed to the time of Tony Benn’s 1975 referendum, which supported our accession in 1973 by a ratio of 2:1.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, an inveterate Euro-opportunist who became famous for his “direct EU bananas” as a Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
For all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a motley company of tax-scared crooks, phone-hackers, and pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair felt exactly the same way about them, but he was aware that when you’re in a cage with a wild gorilla, you have to give her bananas to distract her and keep her from eating you for lunch and tea again.
In fact, Milliband was a greater supporter of Blair than Blair himself in opposing Cameron’s idea of a referendum, as Blair ceded the principles in favor of the abolished EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him a winning ticket.
The press did not forgive him.
But milady Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me amicably on the back in Westminster on Monday — I told him he didn’t have time to spend it on me anymore — seems to risk repeating Neil Kinnock’s ‘boycott Murdoch’ strategy of the ’80s — a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he has to develop a consistent strategy for interacting with the press — not with me, but with Andrew Marr, on whose couch he sat on Sunday in the Air Force.
Corbyn’s official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditionalist tendency of Ukip and the wider circle of "little Englanders" among the Tories can probably say yes to this.
That’s the same thing Hilary “Benn, but not Bennite” Benn said on radio and TV this week, with his domestic boy scout struggling to admit that Corbyn’s appointment of the obnoxious John McDonnell as “shadow” finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father struggled to fight on TV for disloyalty to his colleagues in the Labour Cabinet without going too far or losing his post in the Cabinet.
Hillary's battle was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay “under any circumstances” – Benn’s phrase – is not what McDonnell said, nor is it what J.K. said to peers and members of parliament at a private meeting on Monday night, by popular opinion.
Whatever the Democrat and his “boyfriend” Corbyn wants to say — remember, he touched even me — the discipline of messages remains important in the age of 24-hour television seven days a week, and especially in the whirlpool of social media, the hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It’s wise not to let Cameron get rid of Europe so easily, allowing him to take for granted Labour’s support during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But the fundamental misconception of McDonnell and Corbyn about EU membership – within the framework of the “Benite” economy of the besieged fortress – is no longer a matter of esoteric debate among leftist dissidents, for whom narcissism, generated by minor distinction, is a central tenet in dogmatic disputes.
As for his misconceptions about NATO – Tom Watson is unshakable that J.K. will not agitate for an exit – foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to convey this to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital — they also have suspicious voters — on concessions to Britain when it might all be pointless?
The US is already very disappointed by the weak military actions of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Tory government in power is cutting spending, as I was reminded on Monday during lunch at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize review of e-cigarettes from Public Health England
The government-funded agency’s claims that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking were made at a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are associated with the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE released an important report — a “turning point” last month — calling it a “comprehensive review of the evidence.”
But some researchers have questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the connection of some experts with the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month criticized the “extremely shaky argument” on which PHE built its main conclusion.
In a BMJ article, two more researchers questioned whether these claims had “firm or skewed grounds.”
Martin McKee, a professor of European health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “The fundamental principle of health – rules should be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
According to them, the public expects PHE’s statements that “the current best estimate shows that e-cigarettes are approximately 95% less harmful than tobacco smoking” to be based on detailed evidence analysis and modeling.
In fact, this is deduced from a single meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a model of multicriteria decision-making analysis in order to generalize their views on the harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Capewell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed the BAT health certificates in the Sustainable Development Report.
One in 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the e-cigarette maker, without mentioning the funding he had reportedly previously received from tobacco company Philip Morris.
A reasonable explanation for the selection of board members was not provided, but among them there are several well-known e-cigarette advocates, some of whom also claimed to be funding the industry in the publication.
It is not known whether the other participants in the meeting have experience in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the head of tobacco at PHE.
The scientific paper published by the group “finely agrees” that there is a lack of “substantial evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria,” McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links and limitations were addressed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s statements that “there is currently no evidence that e-cigarettes are expensive, leading children or non-smokers to smoke” are premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Head of Health and Well-Being at PHE, said BMJ’s statements had previously been answered.
He said: “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco smoking.”
One of the two smokers died of his addiction all his life.
All the evidence implies that the health threats from e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the far-reaching consequences.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public as to what is and is not proven by this evidence, especially where the public has had doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people a year die from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
By clearly stating the obvious – that while e-cigarettes are not safe, they only do part of the harm that smoking does – we are doing our job before the nation.
The former head of Channel 4 believes that the BBC should stop the series EastEnders
Former Channel 4 head Luke Johnson believes the BBC should stop producing programmes like EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business rivals would pay a lot for such successful shows as the Albert Square soap opera.
Johnson noted that licensing fees should only be used to create programs that are not produced by other British broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service broadcasts, which probably only a small portion of the audience is watching, at peak airtime when competitors have high-rated shows, and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noted that he had been unsuccessfully trying to establish cooperation with the BBC for six years while working on Channel 4.
“I can’t shake the idea that the BBC is preparing to launch and broadcast programmes that could be shown by competing non-subsidized companies,” Johnson told members of the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of the BBC’s investigation.
If you keep the license fee, which I do not think is a good solution in the medium and long term, then the company should leave on the air only those programs that are not produced and are not going to be produced by other companies.
The Voice show is airing in the prime slot because the creators want to get the maximum possible support for the future.
The idea of no one showing it anymore is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: “I don’t understand why regressive taxes should go to fund transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is common knowledge that they are self-produced.
Other channels would undoubtedly give a lot for it.
I don't understand how this could be public broadcasting.
I don't think that would demean the BBC.
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of chasing ratings "because of the ambition of the staff and their belief that this is the best way to get support in the long run."
His comments about the most popular shows on the BBC echo those of Sky's CEO Tony Ball, who in his 2003 lecture in memory of McTaggart in Edinburgh, invited the BBC to sell series such as EastEnders.
Johnson noted that the BBC's more niche public service broadcasts "continue to go to BBC4, where it is often impossible to assess the audience, but the company's function is fulfilled, and this can be argued in the sermons justifying the <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion licence fee revenue: 'well, of course we do all these obscure broadcasts that nobody is watching.'
They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.
Regarding the licensing fee, Johnson told the committee: “I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the most out of it.
Of course, you all think, we all think 150 pounds a year is a huge amount, but for people for whom 150 pounds is a lot of money, I wonder, they think so because they don’t really watch and listen to the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 executive director David Elstein, who also spoke to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should reconsider Rita’s mission in favor of “inform, educate and entertain.”
He noted that only a small fraction of the BBC’s output is now formally classified as educational – 1% TV content and 0.1% radio content – and that the company should take up the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto “inform, educate and entertain”.
On the partnership, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as Promenade Concerts (only some of which he said are on TV) as well as enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for viewing online.
"Sonogenetics" allows you to control brain cells with the help of sound waves
The video shows how nematodes change direction of movement at the moment when they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using the pulses of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction when they are exposed to sound impulses that are too high for the human ear to hear.
The pulses act by activating neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Researchers are controlling brain activity with the help of light
Scientists said that the worms demonstrate the capabilities of a new technique called “sonogenetics”, the essence of which is to use ultrasound to excite certain cells of the brain, heart and muscles, while the source of ultrasound is located outside the body.
Shrikant Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that sends electrical impulses to the human brain and is used to treat Parkinson’s disease.
Nematode worms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they began to respond when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate into the body of the worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves act on structures called “TRP-4 ion channels” found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open and excite the cells that are associated with them, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To create nematodes that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications to the worms so that their motor neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
During the application of ultrasound to the modified organisms, sound waves were amplified by microscopic bubbles and injected into the worms, activating the modified motor neurons.
The technique is similar to that used in optogenetics, a new direction that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off using light pulses.
Chalasani argues that, compared to this technique, sonogenetics may have some advantages.
Unlike light, which is delivered to the desired area of the brain through fiber, low-frequency ultrasound waves pass freely through the tissues of the body, so for their delivery does not need to pass inside the cranium.
"We believe that for the treatment of some neurological diseases in clinical settings, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will be able to temporarily make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasound signal," Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the technique can be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
Prohibited torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
Advertisements mocking the British arms trade
Watch the Amnesty International video protesting against the arms exhibition.
Awesome Killer Drones!
Shaved iron shackles!
Cluster bombs!
Electric light and noise batons, causing unbearable pain, but leaving no traces!
The cheerful voice and the animated cartoon leave no doubt that this advertisement for the largest international arms exhibition is a caustic parody prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the British government’s intention to “push” weapons to repressive regimes, taking advantage of the exhibition of defense technologies and security systems held at the ExCeL center in Docklands.
DSEI Arms Exhibition: Authoritarian Regimes Go to London
But the special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of many posters at bus stops and on subway trains, which require you to look at them again.
"Important announcement on the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" - written on one of them in London subway fonts with the image of the DLR line turning into a silhouette of a tank.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers will attack the DLR line. Passengers are asked to help prevent the arms exhibition.
300 posters were painted by artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Park "Dismaland".
The group, called the Special Patrol Group, helped spread them across London using a “set of ad space breakers,” a 6-pound set of wrenches that reportedly “gives access to about a third of the advertising space at the bus stops of the planet.”
Transporters in London were not happy about such “vandalism” in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody ads issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and eager to bring political art to audiences outside the galleries.
Many artists begin to work with protest activists, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for the sake of their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the arms exhibition, welcoming passengers in the subway.
Amnesty’s video has been viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by VCCP, a pro bono agency, with the involvement of a graphic designer and voice artist also working for free.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Lever was struck by the publicity silence surrounding the arms show – with a gap in the ExCel calendar – and thought, “Let’s give them a campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They thought of creating more realistic and clever corporate advertising, but “filling her homes with bright colors and animation turned out to be a more exciting activity.”
“They have incredibly helped us draw attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition,” said Tom Davis of Amnesty International.
We now need the UK government to take action to ensure that this torture equipment is not sold illegally right at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art on the subject of the arms exhibition comes from within ExCeL, where participants trade fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed information about an order for the “AT4CS RS for shoulder shooting” received from the US Army.
It includes “an unparalleled cumulative warhead that delivers unrivalled reservation action inside the target.”

Eight golden rules of living in student dormitories
It’s been 11 years since I moved into a student dorm as a normal 19-year-old who still believes in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I recall the strained smiles of those I annoyed—and the numerous, long complaints I’ve made about others.
Basically, what I learned can be broken down into eight simple rules.
Moving to a hostel can range from slightly acting on the nerves to absolutely frightening.
He encourages people to chat: to tell people where you came from, whether you took an academic vacation and where you spent it, whether you support Corbyn and why you "honestly, neither love nor hate" Marmite, because, seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract of HAHAHA, I'll be at my place."
Take a break.
And help others to rest too - ask questions and show interest.
It keeps the conversation going and helps you find people you like, not people you wouldn’t even talk to, even if your eyelashes were on and they were handing out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People’s rooms often turn into drinking establishments, midnight cinemas, and places for social gatherings, but they’re also the place where people dress up and fix their underwear.
Don’t even think about starting college while you’re in a relationship.
Introverts are treated unfairly in universities.
Your room should be a refuge, but many dormitories form a culture of shatany from one room to another, which promotes friendship, communication and leads to long friendships.
It can be hell for someone trying to regain strength.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, “I like you, and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I can recover the energy that I spent communicating with you.”
Try to feel when a fellow student is tired of communicating - and do not knock on it, but send SMS.
By the way, about the knock: do it.
A guy in my dorm followed this principle: if the door wasn’t locked, he was invited in.
He saw something.
Make friends by baking.
As you begin your university life at the peak of Bake-Off's popularity, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself and present a plate of chocolate cookies is no longer such a strange action, not so reminiscent of the 1950s with their "Welcome, we're neighbors, I baked you something, and now smile, and I'll ask you personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel compelled to talk to you, and eventually your face will likely be associated with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good a baker you are.
Poorly bonded lumps of flour, sugar, and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on their door.
Theft of food is a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, stealing someone's chicken is stealing, but is it stealing to take a little milk for tea?
Talk to the owner of the milk.
Most likely, he will offer you not to be shy, even if the inside is boiling with anger.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I sympathize with you - but try to treat it more adult than my neighbor, who poured into his milk dishwashing liquid to take revenge on those who took it without asking.
She's in jail now.
You should not make noise that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you are the same people from the saying about glass houses.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbor to turn down the drum and bass, since it was 3 a.m. and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally fell silent at 5 a.m., she graciously allowed him to sleep for two hours, then cut down her music and locked the door behind her, going for a three-hour exam.
Would it not be romantic for your future spouse to live in the same dormitory as you?
On the contrary, wouldn’t it be extremely, before biting your elbows, clumsy if you took a neighbor for your future spouse, got carried away with them, broke off the relationship and had to see him every day, and perhaps watch him pull all your mutual friends to his side?
Of course, you can not tell the heart - but if the hot neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, try to slightly cool your own fervor.
In that thrilling moment when you realize that someone has left the keys inside their own locked room, the line between pranking and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is fun, but it turns into its opposite in a matter of seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something – but never pack someone’s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock someone else's door and put the keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not glue other people's things with Blu-Tack glue to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: how to install a new operating system on the iPhone after the release of the update from Apple
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, select General, and then - Software Update.
If it is ready, the phone will allow you to download and install it.
Some have encountered problems after installation when an error message appears telling them that "App update failed".
To avoid this, users are advised to either wait until the recovery subsides or try to update via iTunes.
The tips on the phone will allow you to go through the whole process to the end.
The process may involve removing apps to increase free space — but Apple has minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the size of the update, and has also made it easier to perform with a special utility that suggests uninstalling apps and reinstalling them once the process is complete.
It’s worth making sure that your phone is charged or next to the charger when performing the update to prevent the battery from draining.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, as discharging the phone in the process may cause the update to fail.

Washington responded to Russia’s military activity with a phone call.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his opinion, the military support that Moscow provides to President Assad only leads to the aggravation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not going to talk about it with a Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia’s military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
“Secretary Kerry has made clear that continued Russian support for President Assad risks exacerbating and prolonging the conflict, as well as negatively impacting our shared goal of countering extremism, unless we also continue to focus on finding ways to resolve the Syrian conflict through a direct transfer of power,” the State Department said in a statement.
They also noted that Kerry once again emphasized the US commitment to the fight against the Islamic State within the framework of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad will never be able to be a member of it.
In addition, the United States “will be pleased with the constructive role of Russia in trying to confront the Islamic State.”
Last Friday, White House officials said they did not know exactly what Russian troops were doing in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the issue with Moscow.
However, White House spokesman Josh Earnest noted that the time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet come: “When the president decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, then he will pick up the phone and try to make this call.”
Barack Obama himself considers Russia’s decision to increase support for the Assad regime a “loser bet.”
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him that it was a mistake, that continuing to support Assad would only make things worse.
“But he didn’t heed my warnings — and as a result, things got worse,” the president said.
Imported yachts will be exempt from customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sports from paying customs duties and taxes.
The relevant changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free import were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
This was reported to Izvestia by Assistant Minister of Economic Development Elena Lashkina.
In June 2015, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev instructed a number of agencies - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the FSB, the Federal Customs Service, Rosturizm - to prepare proposals to create favorable conditions for yachting in the coastal areas of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their ships abroad - about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 200 million annually go to the treasury of European states for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "On amendments to the List of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from customs duties and taxes", providing for the provision of full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sports.
According to the Ministry, this will certainly contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal areas of the country, - said Lashkina.
This issue was submitted to the Sub-Commission on Customs and Tariffs, Non-Tariff Regulation, Safeguards in Foreign Trade of the Governmental Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and following the discussion was also approved by the agencies.
As the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development noted, the proposed measure for full conditional release when importing is inherently a benefit.
Therefore, after the approval of the protocol of the meeting of the subcommission in the Government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the EAEU member states, Lashkina explained.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from payment of customs duties, taxes, includes musical instruments for the promotion of foreign economic activity and international cooperation, for applications in the field of science, culture, cinema, sports and tourism, for the provision of international assistance, etc. Among them - office equipment (personal computers, writing machines), drills and drills.
The press service of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation "Izvestia" told that they prepared mandatory regulations on the seaports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Evpatoria, which provide for a simplified procedure for registration of the entry and exit of small-sized, sports sailing and pleasure ships to the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport instructed the captains of the seaports of the Crimea to ensure the application of a simplified procedure for the entry of small-sized, sports sailing and pleasure vessels into the seaport and the exit of the listed vessels from the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport has also prepared draft decrees of the Government of the Russian Federation on the approval of the boundaries of the water area of the seaports of Crimea.
In relation to Yalta and Feodosia, the orders have already been adopted, the rest are in the process of approval, - noted in the press service of the department.
According to the Ministry of Transport, state supervision, classification and inspection, state registration in respect of small-sized vessels used for non-commercial purposes should be carried out by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia it is extremely difficult with yachting precisely because of the poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, then there is a whole constantly developing industry in which a large number of people are involved.
In Russia, in fact, everything is in place.
Our coast is of little interest, the only piece where you can operate yachts all year round is the Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But the big difficulty is that in this area extremely strict rules of the border service: in order to go for a walk on the yacht, you need to issue a lot of permits.
In addition, inside Russia, the yacht even has nowhere to refuel.
Two days it can go with its fuel, and then there is a problem where to get it, - says the company's sales director Denis Novikov.
As for places for storing yachts, Moscow and St. Petersburg now have special hangars for yachts up to 30 m. Also, yachts are sent to storage in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers are rich people, but with the onset of the crisis, the demand for yachts has decreased.
The World Bank has granted Ukraine a loan of $ 500 million.
The World Bank approved a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $ 500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
“The new financing will support a number of priority measures to implement reforms in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine,” the report said.
Tsimao Fan, World Bank Country Director for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, said the banking sector reforms would help revive credit in the real economy and stimulate a recovery in economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank is witnessing the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, Fan calls on the Ukrainian government to speed up reforms.
Earlier, the Polish government approved the provision of a loan of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 100 million to Ukraine, RIA Novosti reported.
Prisons are being asked to set up separate units for transgender people.
At the Public Council under the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) for the protection of the rights of convicts in October 2015, among other issues, the possibility of creating separate blocks for transgender people and transvestites in the colonies will be discussed.
About this "Izvestia" said the member of the Council Vladislav Grib.
According to him, depending on the total number of convicts in Russia who have not decided on gender, in domestic prisons it is possible to provide for separate cells, blocks or even (if there are many such criminals) in the future to create a special colony for transgender people.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that it is possible to determine the punishment of citizens in such isolated places only after the convicts undergo appropriate medical examinations, which will prove that the offender is indeed a person identifying himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that isolating transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving their sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice successfully operates abroad: in the SIZO (where the accused are before the court decision) there are separate cells for transgender people, and in correctional institutions - special units.
Today, this is the only way to deal with such criminals.
They definitely need to be isolated, since the presence of transvestites and transgender people in ordinary cells is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and a sea of problems for FSIN employees.
Humiliation of trances by cellmates is guaranteed, - says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how big the city is, how many criminals with an indeterminate sex, you need to calculate where to allocate them.
Prisons are not exactly needed - only cameras, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgender people.
According to Grib, the block can hold 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized corps is created in Russia alone, then transgender prisoners will be able to enter the prison from any region.
Citizens are held in a pre-trial detention center at the scene of the crime, so the receipts of transvestites or transgenders from other subjects during the investigation and trial are unrealistic, but to introduce such a practice for already convicted in a separate colony - yes, - says Grib.
We will remind, on the eve of law enforcement officers were unable to decide in which pre-trial detention center - male or female - to determine the detainee for drug possession of 24-year-old transsexual Dmitry Kozhukov (known as Alina Davis), because of what a man with a girlish appearance was not arrested.
He was released on a no-show.
This news has been widely discussed in social networks and media, since the mechanism of transgender people in pre-trial detention centers and colonies in Russia really does not yet exist.
Russian human rights activist, LGBT activist (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolai Alekseev supported the idea of creating special places for the punishment of transgender people, noting that abroad it is also possible to define people in the colony - male or female - depending on their own desire.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, this is a very small percentage, but the problem exists, as well as the issue of ensuring security in prisons for homosexuals, - says Alekseev.
Prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be made in the name of this and for homosexuals, especially since there are more of them in prisons than transgender people.
At the same time, Alexeyev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who are ready to impersonate transsexuals in order to get into a colony different from the usual ones.
Of course, it is possible to introduce a medical examination before placing people in a transgender colony, but not always everything is unambiguous.
For example, in the United States, one of the prisoners Chelsea Manning looked like a man, and already in prison said that he wants to change gender, — said Alekseev.
A person can feel like anything.
But as long as there are no separate places for transgender people to serve their sentences, I doubt that prison officials will think seriously about the safety of such people and delve into the intricacies of their orientation or gender identity.
At the same time, Boris Lordkipanidze, an international expert on reproductive health issues in the Russian Federation, noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transgender criminals in the colony could greatly delay the start of serving sentences by convicts.
A commission is created - this is a question of sexology, psychiatrists conduct long-term observations, this is not one test on the basis of which a high-precision conclusion is made.
The current state of psychiatry allows for this.
Therefore, before sex change, potential patients always undergo such examinations - they show exactly whether sex change with surgical intervention is a necessary measure, - says Lordkipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how to implement this system in relation to convicts, because on average such a survey takes a month.
The doctor, despite the fact that in general he supported the idea of creating separate blocks for transgender people, also doubts that in the current economic conditions it would be expedient to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations - transgender people in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate, there are no official statistics, but if we take into account that about 5% of homosexuals in Russia, we can say that there are even fewer transgender people, and those who have such a deviation and even commit crimes are not a small number at all, - Lordkipanidze said.
Now, at the request of the administration of the colony, homosexuals, transgender people can get separate conditions of detention.
Mikhail Antipov won the World Junior Chess Championship.
In Khanty-Mansiysk ended the world championship in chess among juniors up to 20 years.
The end of the series was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and it was the Russian Mikhail Antipov, who managed to catch up with the Polish Jan-Krzysztof Duda, who seemed to confidently go to the title.
The girls’ victory was celebrated by Ukrainian chess player Natalia Buksa.
The World Chess Championship, held from the beginning of September in Khanty-Mansiysk, by the middle of the tournament distance, seemed to have lost almost all the intrigue, since the representative of Poland Jan-Krzysztof Duda, who issued a series of four victories (competitions are held on the Swiss system in 13 rounds), confidently took the lead.
Given that Duda was the ranking favorite of the championship, and in general is considered one of the most promising young chess players, the probability that he will miss the extracted gap, seemed very small.
And even when Duda slowed down and allowed the Russian Mikhail Antipov to reduce the gap to only 0.5 points, he remained the obvious favorite in the fight for the title.
After all, Antipov, in order to catch up with the leader, it was necessary to win in the 13th round.
But even that wouldn't help you win Duda your game.
Plus, this mandatory victory, of course, could affect the game of the Russian chess player and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He confidently coped with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he had to wait for Duda, who met with Benjamin Bock, to finish his game.
Fortunately for Antipov, the Polish chess player drew a draw with the Dutchman.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional indicators.
That is why the leadership of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug, whose governor Natalia Komarova, traditionally pays great attention to the development of chess in the region, presented him with the main prize.
But in the competition girls intriguing ending did not happen.
The leader of the tournament - Natalia Bukse (Ukraine) - to win the title it was enough not to lose in the last round, which she successfully did.
Thus, the victory of the Russian Alina Bivol did not allow her to catch up with Bux.
The Russian athlete remained second with a gap of 0.5 points from the champion.
Vimpelkom changes the regional structure.
The company unites the Volga and Ural regions into one consolidated Volga-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East - into the East region.
The project will be completed by November 1.
As Mikhail Slobodin, CEO of VimpelCom, noted, the changes are being made in order to “remain a strong player in the market”, to develop the company “in new, not always favorable external conditions”.
In an interview with Rossiya 24 TV channel, Slobodin said that they intend to reduce “tens of percent” of personnel in Russia.
Rospotrebnadzor checked 78 Moscow Burger King and issued 367 prescriptions.
As a result, the restaurant on Volokolamsk highway was fined 50 thousand rubles, and the restaurant on Bolshaya Tula street was closed for 90 days, but resumed work after the elimination of all violations.
43 diners violated the requirements for the arrangement of premises.
Among other violations, unsatisfactory sanitary-technical and sanitary-hygienic maintenance of premises, non-compliance with the requirements for the ventilation device, bacteria of the E. coli group were found in some institutions.
The franchise for the Burger King brand belongs to "Burger Rus" LLC, the owner of the "Chocolate Shop" chain, Alexander Kolobov, there are 293 snack bars in Russia.
Igor Artemyev, the head of the FAS, said that the agency is against the indexation of 10% of tariffs for cargo transportation and the provision of state subsidies, as requested by Russian Railways.
At first they wanted 17% indexation, now they want 10%, and also multibillion-dollar subsidies from the budget, - he says.
We say: this is wrong, this is too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, give up expensive mansions, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money left and right.
He added that the FAS has its own, “much stricter” proposals, which are now being discussed in the government.
Polymetal is considering a net settlement option with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of executing a $300 million share put option, the gold mining company said.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the price of shares issued in favor of Sumeru and market quotations), which can be taken from the free cash flow.
Sumeru has until October 3 to either exercise the option or claim a surcharge.
The details of the negotiations in Polymetal are not disclosed.
The option was concluded as part of the purchase of Polymetal of the Kyzyl project in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stasishin, Director of the Department of Housing Policy of the Ministry of Construction, said that the Ministry, together with the Central Bank, is developing a procedure for the rehabilitation of developers.

The second draft is a more complete version of the script, the third is the final plan of the film.
The Ministry of Industry and Trade: targeted food aid will not become an analogue of cards in the USSR.
Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia Viktor Evtukhov said that the program of targeted food aid will not be analogous to the card system of food distribution that existed in the USSR.
We are talking about modern targeted food aid to the population and support for an effective domestic commodity producer.
I ask you not to speculate on the phrase "food card."
I would especially like to note that it is not necessary to confuse the proposed food cards with the echo of the past times of total deficit, a card distribution system in which the amount of products received is normalized.
We have so far proposed a concept, if it is approved, we will propose changes to the legislation,” Mr. Yevtukhov said.
Earlier, Kommersant wrote that the program for the introduction of food cards for the poor was submitted to the government.

This year, the survey of the Association of Russian Managers “Top-1000 Russian Managers” is released for the 16th time.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian managers of the highest echelon, the study summarizes the work of Russian managers for the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of last year’s ranking winners.
The winners of the last year are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate of the rating of the current year and nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates included in the initial list is proposed to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies, which it would be advisable to add to the overall pool of candidates.
It is possible to nominate the following heads of functional areas of the company: CFO, Commercial Director, Marketing Director, HR Director, IT Director, Director of Public and Corporate Relations, Director of Relations with Authorities, Director of Corporate Governance.
Each manager proposed by experts is sent an invitation to participate in the ranking and is given the opportunity to nominate his management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
Nomination of candidates on the sectoral principle is carried out on the basis of the industry classifier of the Association of Managers of Energy: information technology, commercial banks, forest and forest processing industry, engineering, media business, metallurgy, multidisciplinary holdings, professional services, communication and telecommunications, service and production of consumer goods, insurance, construction, trade, finance, pharmaceuticals.
Each participant is provided with a login and password to enter the site www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information about the other participants and can put their assessments on the criteria proposed for each functional direction.
The methodology of rating is based on the principle "The best choose the best": top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
This principle allows you to get the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at meetings of expert commissions.
To the full-time meetings of expert commissions are invited all willing candidates of the rating of the current year and multiple candidates of the rating of previous years.
The commissions are organized on a functional basis: a commission for the approval of the list of top managers and eight commissions for the approval of heads of functional areas.
At the meetings of the expert commissions, it is proposed to approve the submitted lists in alphabetical order (places are kept strictly in accordance with the Internet assessment and are closed information until the publication of the rating) or make updates to them according to the attached list of reserve candidates.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the norms of "Kommersant".
At the time of publication of the rating, changes in the status of managers and companies are possible.
The comfortable rate for an investment loan is 10-13%.
According to experts, the lending market for small and medium-sized businesses fell by 40% in January-April this year.
What do you think the situation is today?
After the panic of late 2014 - early 2015, the volume of lending to SMEs decreased significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
Loans under 25-30% per annum were not beneficial to anyone.
If earlier the bank could put in an increased rate all its possible problems in the future, from delays to non-returns, now it is impossible to do it: rates are so sky-high.
For businesses, the current level of SME lending rates is uncomfortable.
For a significant part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their payback.
A rate of 10-13% would allow a business to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns on them.
How well do you think the demand for loans is being met?
After the reduction of the Central Bank interest rate, the situation improved slightly.
Credit has become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers began to apply for loans much less often.
First of all, the business does not understand the prospects of its development and future revenues.
Today, business has one way out: it is necessary to learn how to work, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
It is necessary to monitor the current results more closely, to control the movement of funds.
At the same time, in the presence of financial resources, it is worth using new technologies that allow you to modernize equipment, reduce production costs and energy supply.
All this, in the end, allows the company to make products more competitive and keep the business even in an unstable economic situation.
What are the main trends in the SME lending market will strengthen and will affect its development until the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for a reduction in the average rate will largely depend on the policy of the Central Bank, and now the regulator demonstrates consistency in reducing the key rate.
However, a radical fall in the price of loans for SMEs should not be expected.
In the current situation, the problem, first of all, is inflation, which makes it necessary to increase the interest rate to obtain real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even with a decrease in the rates of the Central Bank.
If we talk about the level of delay, then traditionally small and medium-sized businesses, limited both in the possibilities of replenishing funds and in the options for correcting economic behavior, will certainly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I would not expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
This is how the word Mazda is written in Japanese hieroglyphics.
Beautiful, concise and at the same time quite difficult for those who are accustomed to Cyrillic or Latin.
So is the new crossover CX-5, as, however, and any other model of the brand: without pretentiousness attractive on the outside, technically perfect inside.
Japanese is simply due to its "Japaneseness" is able to bring the attachment to the products of the Land of the Rising Sun to a state of complete delight.
You can argue in favor of cars from other countries, and a person even in principle will agree with these arguments, but the whole conversation will crumble from the final phrase: "But this is a Japanese car!
There is nothing to argue about!
Such people should probably love not only the technique, but also everything else Japanese.
To quote from the course of Basse, to spice up wasabi food, to collect katanas and to dress your girlfriend - no, not in kimono, of course, but according to the canons of street Japanese fashion: cute, creative and very unexpected.
Perhaps the Japanese school uniform is the only form that girls wear with pleasure after school.
It has amazing properties: both sensual and strict at the same time.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of the CX-5 is the radiator grille with five horizontal lines.
But much more changes the appearance of the car a new pattern of headlights and taillights, by which the car is instantly recognized in the flow of cars.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.
The silhouette is harmonious, the forms are sensual, but the appearance at the same time has a touch of rigor.
You won't have to call the police.
At the wheel of the CX-5, one of the safest in the world, you can experience only stoic Japanese tranquility.
The 2.2-litre diesel engine delivers high torque over a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine with a capacity of 175 hp is only 5.9 liters. It is equipped with an exclusively automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.
Black shoes, black coat, black bag...
To add a little black humor to this image, you can choose leggings with a print from the Not Cross police tape.
However, Mazda made every effort to drive the CX-5 you did not find yourself in the place of your own accident.
To further enhance comfort, while maintaining excellent handling, the suspension has redesigned the design of the front and rear shock absorbers, as well as optimized the shape of the bushings of the front lower levers.
The all-wheel drive system is adapted to Russian conditions.
The noise level from the road and the engine at high speeds has been reduced by 13%.
A swimsuit in a flower or stripe is as boring as a budget sedan.
It is different if the girl is flaunting in a swimsuit with an original pattern.
For example, from a computer game in the genre of role-playing action.
It will then receive no less attention than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved design for both the front and rear seats, which provides the optimal amount of space for both wide shoulders and long legs – who has what.
Still long-legged will surely appreciate the fact that the stops in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not hit the ankles in turns.
The widest range of Mazda active safety systems is offered on the CX-5.
In order to identify a potential threat, radars, lasers and cameras are used here.
There is adaptive lighting, and a warning about leaving the lane, and monitoring of dead zones, and safe braking.
The Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in its class.
Comfortable, with a minimum of protrusions, it accommodates a load of 561 liters. The rear seats fold in a ratio of 4:2:4 - each section is equipped with a separate removable lever - and increase the luggage compartment to 1560 liters.
The costume of the cartoon hero in Japan is called "kigurumi".
The kigurumi pyjamas look especially enticing.
Everything is possible in it!
Sleep, of course.
But also to entertain small children.
Or just walking around like that on the street...
After all, it is so great when you have the opportunity to choose - cool clothes, behavior or car.
Thank you for your help in the preparation of the material shop Kawaicat.
Kiev broke the nuclear union.
Kiev has officially formalized the refusal of Ukraine to cooperate with Russia on the completion of the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.
The Verkhovna Rada on Wednesday on the second attempt still voted to terminate the agreement with Moscow.
Arrangements for the completion of the third and fourth blocks were signed in 2010-2012, but it was not possible to start the project.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law terminating the agreement concluded in 2010-2012 with the Russian Federation on the construction of the third and fourth units at the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.
The bill introduced by the government was passed only with a second vote, for the first time it was supported by 210 deputies with the necessary minimum of 226, but then 234 members of parliament voted in favor of the draft.
The Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant under the original project was supposed to have four power units of 1 GW with VVER reactors, but only two were built.
Negotiations with Moscow on the completion led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement in 2010, in 2011-2012 the Rada adopted the relevant laws.
Since there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, it was assumed that the blocks would have to be built on the credit of the Russian side, but the funds were never allocated.
After the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in relations between the two countries, Kiev began to curtail relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing its refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant and on the project to build a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only sphere where relations have remained, remained purchases in the Russian Federation of fuel for the existing Ukrainian nuclear power plants (provided about half of the electricity generation in the country), as so far the Ukrainian NNEGC "Energoatom" to replace Russian supplies nothing.
Plans to complete the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been completely abandoned: back in 2014, negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS were announced in Kiev.
UN Secretary-General against the use of military force in the settlement of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said during a press conference that it is impossible to resolve the situation in Syria by military means.
"There is no military solution," he said in response to a question about Russia's military support for Syria.
Ban also announced that he will hold a meeting with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council later this month.
“The meeting will be on Syria,” he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia Nikolai Bogdanovsky said that the General Staff does not exclude the possibility of creating a future air force base in Syria.
There are no such plans yet.
“Anything can happen,” Mr. Bogdanovsky said.
Earlier, Kommersant reported that the United States does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that military assistance to official Damascus is necessary to fight the Islamic State terrorist group banned in Russia.

The OSCE PA reported a possible meeting of parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine to the Parliamentary Assembly (PA) of the OSCE Artur Gerasimov said about the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian colleagues-parliamentarians to discuss the situation in the South-East of Ukraine.
"What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, possibly between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," Gerasimov said.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and "return to the normal life of our countries."
Asked whether, in his opinion, a dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level is currently possible - in the Normandy format or in the format of a contact group at the OSCE PA - Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue was held, there are Minsk agreements.
At the same time, according to the politician, in Kiev support any kind of dialogue.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine at the talks, former President Leonid Kuchma said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics have not yet fundamentally changed their positions at the trilateral talks, but the tone of the dialogue has become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the election commission of Nizhny Novgorod summed up the results of the elections to the city Duma in the municipal district, distributing 12 deputy mandates, played out on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints about violations during the elections came from representatives of the Communist Party, accusing the electoral commission of “covering up forgeries”.
The opposition's comments were not accepted.
At the same time, the party “Communists of Russia” refused to organize a referendum on the abolition of fees for the repair of apartment buildings.
The City Electoral Commission officially presented the results of the elections to the pride of Nizhny Novgorod for the municipal electoral district.
In total, 1.03 million people were included in the voter lists in Nizhny Novgorod, 746.7 thousand people were issued ballots for voting in precinct commissions, and 268 thousand voters voted in the elections.
More than 11,700 ballots were declared invalid, and 24 were lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed among political parties, depending on the votes they received.
According to the lists of United Russia, six deputies in the pride rely on Dmitry Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizaveta Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorny.
The only mandate of the LDPR was given to the leader of the party Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
The two mandates of the Communist Party are distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and State Duma deputy Alexander Tarnaev.
The three mandates of “Fair Russia” go to Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalyugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates must decide whether they will work as deputies in the city Duma: in case of refusal of the mandate, he moves to the next candidate on the party list.
Chairman of the Goryzbirkom Alexander Makeev told the members of the commission that he is introducing duty for “sending telegrams to Zhirinovsky and others” for the rejection of mandates.
In approving the protocol on the results of the elections, the representatives of the CPRF stated multiple violations.
Leonid Krasnokutsky, a member of the Horizbirkom with the right of deliberative vote from the Communist Party, proposed not to recognize the results of voting in four districts No. 21-24, recalling that the entrance to the administration building, where four district commissions were located, was closed by order of the head of the administration of the Sormovsky district.
Neither the deputies of Gos Udma, nor the candidates themselves, nor the observers could go inside for a long time, and the resonant scandal with the storming of the doors of the district administration was shown on television.
All observers and members of the commissions with the right to a deliberative vote had the opportunity to be present at the meetings of the district commissions.
The head stopped access to them only when the voting ended and the precinct commissions had not yet come to hand over their ballots.
This was done in order to prevent various provocations.
"Then the head was corrected, and at all meetings interested persons could be present," Natalia Andryushina, a member of the electoral committee, said.
The Communists objected that in the blocked administration building, Lyudmila Aristova, a deputy of the regional assembly, was illegally detained for more than four hours, about which a statement was sent to the Investigative Committee.
The opposition was also indignant that in a number of polling stations on election day, they began sealing the ballot boxes at 6-7 in the morning, laying out ballot papers for early voting.
At the same time, no one notified the members of the commissions with the right to an advisory vote and observers, so they came to the beginning of the elections at 8 am.
The Communists believe that in the morning hours before the opening of the polling stations, ballots could be thrown uncontrollably into the ballot boxes.
However, the electoral commission, which has already considered more than 124 complaints on various occasions, according to Alexander Makeev, did not find any violations with the inclusion of unaccounted ballots.
The members of the commission did not support the proposal of their colleague from "Fair Russia" Maria Popova through an oblibirke to come out with amendments to regional legislation in order to clearly establish the time of opening of envelopes with early voting ballots, which then fall into the ballot box.
"In the order of your own initiative, at least contact the CEC," Alexander Makeev advised Mrs. Popova.
At the end of the meeting, a member of the CPRF, Sergei Samokhin, attacked the chairman with loud accusations, shouting that he ignored dozens of complaints and covered up electoral fraud.
"You are not here at the rally, be careful to declare!" - offended the chairman of the election committee.
As a result, the protocol was approved almost unanimously.
Until September 27, the electoral commission must approve the general results of the elections, after which the first meeting of the city Duma of Nizhny Novgorod of the sixth convocation will be appointed within three weeks.
In addition to determining the results of the elections, the city election commission refused the political party “Communists of Russia” to register an initiative group for a local referendum.
According to the documents, the party was going to bring to the discussion of Nizhny Novgorod two questions: whether they agree with the fact that the fees for the repair of apartment buildings should be “immediately canceled”, and tariffs for housing and communal services “freeze until 2020”.
However, the lawyer of the Duma Irina Maslova explained that the appeal of the “Communists of Russia” is contrary to the law.
FedEx’s revenue is mixed, with a decline in 2016 forecasts.
FedEx reported disappointing results last quarter, and the delivery service giant reduced its annual profit forecast due to falling demand for freight services and rising costs in its ground transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx said it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares fell about 2.5 percent in preliminary trading 45 minutes before the opening of the exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it plans to earn $10.40 to $10.90 in the fiscal year that ends next May, down 20 cents from its previous forecast.
Analysts suggested $10.84, according to a FactSet review.
The decline in the forecast is observed despite a rise in rates by an average of 4.9 percent, which will enter into force on January 4, and an increase in fees for land transportation of heavy or dimensional cargo, which begins in November.
The company said it is still planning revenue growth from last year due to cost reductions, higher gross revenue and growth in online commerce.
Fred Smith, chairman and chief executive officer, said the company “has been operating stably with weak economic conditions compared to the forecast, especially in manufacturing and global trade.”
The holiday hiring plans were announced the day after a competitor, UPS, announced they planned to hire an additional 95,000 employees, roughly the same as they hired last year.
For the quarter that ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than a year earlier.
Earnings per share were $2.42, close to the forecast average of $2.44 per share, conducted by Zacks Investment Research in a survey of 12 analysts.
Revenue increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks suggested $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a downturn in the express international transportation sector, which has led to a lack of growth in gross revenue in its express transportation division.
However, the boom in online shopping has dramatically improved results in FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenues from ground transportation grew by 29%, but operating revenues remained generally unchanged due to increased costs for large shipments and self-insurance.
The express division received higher income due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector, income fell due to higher labor costs.
In preliminary trading, about an hour before the opening of the exchange, FedEx shares fell by $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, falling 11 percent year-on-year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
At the most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week at a 27-foot redwood table deciding whether or not to raise the key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At one end of the richly decorated two-story meeting room will hang a wall image of the United States.
This card is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the country above all others.
The central bank has been given a double mandate by Congress to maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal System have acknowledged that there is a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate may prove to be an unknown factor in the near-forecasted decision to be announced on Thursday on whether the U.S. economy is ready to break away from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate since late 2008.
Even with most of the data showing strong economic growth, recent turmoil in global financial markets could keep already cautious Federal policymakers from adding volatility by raising the federal funds base rate — even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important consideration,” said Lindsay M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., a brokerage.
“However, I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise rates, the increased uncertainty around the global market would be enough to give them an excuse to wait any longer,” she said.
There is no consensus on what will be done in the Federal Reserve, which in itself provokes fluctuations in the financial market.
About half of economists recently polled by Bloomberg predicted interest rates would rise this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the federal system to hold off, with a key indicator showing only about a 30 percent chance of a quick recovery.
This could lead to a fall in the stock market if the Federal system raises the rate, provided that decision makers do not soften the blow by promising that the next hike will not be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The take-off was triggered by expectations that policymakers would leave the Fed this week, said John Lonsky, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research.
“It will be a surprise if the Federal system raises rates at this point in time,” he said.
If the leadership of the Federal Reserve System does so, “they will have to go far in approving their strategy in order to keep the financial markets in hand so that they do not panic.”
Other experts objected that a rate hike could reassure financial markets as it would remove uncertainty about how the federal system would operate.
Just a month ago, the federal system seemed to be leaning toward a 0.25% rate hike this month, taking the first small step in a slow tightening of financial conditions that could confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expected a rate hike this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed.
While job creation slowed in August, labor market growth has been steady this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest rate in more than seven years, and almost to what the federal system considers full employment.
Wage growth is showing signs of accelerating.
And while inflation continues to fall below the central bank’s annual target of 2%, the Federal Reserve said the key reason was the temporary effect of a sharp drop in oil prices.
The economy “can handle and needs higher rates, given the shrinking labor market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 16 percent from a record high in May as investors feared a slowdown in China’s economy could slow global growth.
The market has partially regained its position this month, and the Dow Jones index is now about 10% below the high May value.
For the leadership of the Federal Reserve, market outrage further complicates the difficult calculations of the term of the interest rate increase.
“In the absence of information about what happened in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would have been screwing up at this meeting,” said Steven D. Oliner, a senior researcher at UCLA’s Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve official.
Now, according to his forecasts, they will wait at least a month to get more control over the consequences.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty about what the consequences could be for the U.S. economy, and they have almost no reliable data after the recent events in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not the main concern of the Federal system, and it should not be technically taken into account when making these decisions.
But essentially, the Federal Reserve has become the world’s financial power.
The central bank’s influence in recent years has been enormous.
Just a hint from then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could “shut down” its monetary expansion caused shocks to markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, one would expect Federal Reserve executives to not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other central banks and experts to better understand the global economy.
Their decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Carabella, head of Envestnet Inc, a company that deals with global wealth management strategies.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that “there have been instances in the history of the Federal Reserve System of overreactions to financial market movements that do not appear to be related to economic principles.”
Lacker, a voting member of the influential Federal Open Market Committee who insisted on raising rates, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the federal system to lower its base rate by 0.75% in three sessions, “despite the limited identifiable implications for U.S. growth,” Laker said.
A year later, the leaders of the Federal system canceled these reductions.
The Federal Reserve should put stability first only in times of major crises, such as the 2008 market crash,” said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the interest rate committee at the Bank of England.
The last panic was nowhere near that level, he said.
“You certainly wouldn’t want to be in a situation where you’re scared of rising rates because the markets are going through a shock,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for the World Economy.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and makes no mention of financial stability, and until that changes, I don’t think they should be ahead of the curve.

State Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin admits that the United States deliberately destabilizes the situation in the Middle East so that waves of refugees flow to Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed this opinion to journalists in Ulaanbaatar during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
“I am not a supporter of conspiracy theories, but the question arises: is not Europe the ultimate goal of those who, with such maniacal persistence in recent years, destabilized the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East?”
“Someone must have assumed and known that the flows of refugees, these unfortunate and destitute people who are fleeing death, will rush to the prosperous countries of the EU,” he added.
Naryshkin asked: “Have many European political leaders openly spoken out about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees that is now literally engulfing their countries?”
“No, the old Europe, with few exceptions, prefers to remain silent,” he said.
According to Naryshkin, NATO violates many European values and norms of international law.
“Europe, unfortunately, has long and impartially looked and looks at how the military boot, sewn according to NATO standards, tramples and moral ideals and the basic fundamental principles and norms of international law,” – said the speaker.
Government troops and their loyal militias are opposed by rebels, mostly Islamists.
Later, the opponents of the Syrian government were joined by the Islamic State terrorist group, which is banned in Russia.
The U.S. supports rebels who oppose both Assad and ISIS.
Damascus considers the rebels to be terrorists.
The Syrian president called the reason for the West's hostility to Russia.
The West’s claims to countries like Syria, Russia, and Iran are actually that they are sovereign states.
This opinion was expressed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in an interview with RT, Channel One, Russia 24, NTV, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax and Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
According to Assad, the West does not accept partners and sovereign states.
In these countries, he would like to remove one person and put in his place another who will act in the interests of Western countries, and not in the interests of his homeland, he said.
Assad drew attention to the sharp turn of the Western media with the beginning of the coup in Ukraine.
According to him, for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin “has turned from a friend of the West into an enemy, a tsar, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, who came to power undemocratically, despite the fact that he was elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West.”
Putin called on the international community to join forces with Assad to fight the Islamic State.
Commenting on the constant statements of the West that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he leaves - then at the request of the people, and not at the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva communiqué.
“If the people want him to stay, the president stays, otherwise he should leave immediately,” he said.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and reminded that cooperation is carried out with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism with neighboring Iraq.
Speaking about military support from Iran, the Syrian leader noted that this country supports the Syrian state in politics, in the economy and in the military sphere.
He denied allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran is supplying us with military equipment.
“Of course, there is an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out,” he said.
As for the other States, we are open to cooperating with any of them if there is a serious desire to fight terrorism.
“We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-ISIS coalition led by the United States,” Assad said.
The death toll exceeded 230 thousand people, the number of refugees - 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was seized by the terrorist group "Islamic State", banned in Russia.
The international coalition led by the United States is carrying out air strikes on ISIS positions.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Politics: World: Lenta.ru
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry held a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
This is reported by Reuters with reference to the representative of the State Department John Kirby.
It is noted that the topic of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide further details.
At the same time, he said that the United States has the tools to “further isolate Russia” if it supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Lavrov, during a conversation with Kerry, again emphasized the need to create a united front against terrorist groups operating in the country.
They also discussed ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
In addition, some bilateral issues were raised.
Earlier, U.S. officials said Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria and expressed concern about Moscow’s increased support for Assad.
Washington said that if Russia continues to support Assad, it will be even more isolated from the international community.
In response, the press Secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov said that the country will not fall into international isolation.
The rebels are calling for the overthrow of the Assad regime.
Part of the territory was seized by the terrorist organization “Islamic State”.

Borodai called the information of the American newspaper a slander on Strelkov.
Former head of the government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic Alexander Borodai denied the information, which was published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said this in a telephone interview with the correspondent of "Lents.ru".
The Washington Post’s story is wonderful because it’s all over the place.
The former Minister of Defense of the DPR Igor Strelkov, of course, no one tied and "exited" him from the territory of the republics of Donbass in a very elated mood, without ropes, without three trucks of money, which are attributed to him by different characters," he said.
According to Boroday, the talk about Strelkov in a conversation with a reporter of the American newspaper really went.
“Yes, I said that Strelkov urgently needed to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic,” the former head of the DPR government said.
Boroday stressed that he does not know why the correspondent of the American edition decided to write that Strelkov was taken to the territory of Russia “related”.
I suspect this is a provocation.
If this is not a provocation, then this is surprisingly misunderstood words, since I emphasized that Strelkov left himself," Boroday said.
"This is a slander against me and Strelkov," he concluded.
Earlier, an article appeared on the pages of The Washington Post, which quoted Boroday’s words that he had taken Strelkov to the territory of Russia in a forced manner.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he was forced to tie his associate.
The Polish authorities began to search for a train with Nazi gold.
Polish loggers have started cutting down trees over an underground tunnel, where, according to some reports, there is a train with gold of the Third Reich.
Work began on Tuesday, September 15, Reuters reports.
According to military experts, clearing the forest is necessary in order to verify the veracity of rumors about the railway composition with treasures.
There may be weapons and valuable minerals inside the train.
On August 31, the governor of the Polish Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Tomasz Smolarz, suggested that the new evidence for the existence of a train with gold is no more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to cordon off the search area.
Three days earlier, Poland’s Deputy Minister of Culture, Piotr Zuchowski, said that local treasure hunters had “a 99 percent chance” of finding the same train with the gold of the Third Reich that is mentioned in the legends.
Zhukhovsky noted that if the assumptions are confirmed and the jewels are discovered, they will become the property of the state treasury, while the treasures will not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the law firm contacted the authorities of the Polish city of Walbrzych with a message that they found a train in a bricked tunnel at a depth of 70 meters.
The chief narcologist of the Russian Federation proposed to ban the sale of tobacco to persons under 21 years.
Russia's chief druglogist has proposed to ban the sale of tobacco until the age of 21.
Evgeny Brun noted that before this age, "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drug - acts especially harmful."
So he said live radio station "Moscow speaking", commenting on the information that the speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21 years old.
Humans mature unevenly.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, a person is physically ready for this.
Mentally, he is ready for a full life in society from the age of 21.
“It is known from scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry, is finally maturing only by the age of 21,” said Brune.
Earlier, a member of the Public Chamber and the head of the project "Sober Russia" Sultan Hamzayev told "Izvestia" that Matvienko supported the initiative to increase the age limit for the sale of alcohol and "agreed with the Public Chamber to raise this issue again on the site of the upper house of parliament."
According to the activist, a working group will soon be established in the Federation Council to develop a bill under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible was asked to check for compliance with the law on information protection of children
A resident of Novosibirsk appealed to the regional prosecutor’s office with a request to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law “On the protection of children from information that causes harm to their health and development”, the correspondent of Sib.fm read the statement on September 16.
The author of the appeal stated that on August 26, 2015, he purchased a Bible published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society in the "Chitay-gorod" store on Krasny Prospekt.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that, in his opinion, violate the Federal Law "On the Protection of Children from Information Harmful to Their Health and Development."
On September 16, the application was accepted for consideration by the prosecutor’s office of the city of Novosibirsk.
The response to the appeal of the resident of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, - the applicant commented to the Sib.fm correspondent.
In addition, this is a very serious problem that will stir the society.
He began to read the Bible, which he had never done before.
Brazilian Union of Pediatricians Rio Grande promotes healthy nutrition for breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a scandalous method by which it is going to convince women of the need for proper nutrition during breastfeeding: the method involves the demonstration of images of babies sucking their breasts, painted with images of harmful food.
The composition of breast milk includes various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Due to the high energy requirements, pregnant and pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study suggests that a single increase in calorie intake is not the only dietary change mothers should make.
In a recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, it was found that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects gene expression in children and prevents them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of unhealthy nutrition on the child’s immune system has been revealed.
Under Hamburg train rammed a school bus.
Near Hamburg, a train crashed into a school bus that got stuck on a train track.
A 23-year-old female driver, realizing that she could not move off the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
A minute later, there was a collision in front of their eyes.
It was filmed by one of the students.
Due to the emergency situation, there was panic among the students.
Some children began to cry and run along the roadside.
The route is still blocked.
According to the police, no one was injured, except for one passenger of the train, who was slightly injured.
Damage from the accident was estimated at 300 thousand euros.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The leadership of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) has called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died from injuries sustained in a duel with Filipino Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles according to the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category to 57.15 kg, held on Friday, ended with the victory of Magali by a knockout in the 12th round.
Brown was taken to the hospital with a brain injury.
His condition was assessed as critical and he was connected to a life support device.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 victories, suffered only two defeats and one fight ended in a draw.
He's got two kids left.
This is the second fatality among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, 23-year-old student Bradon Smith died from injuries sustained in the ring.
Now AMA recommends not to engage in this sport, but it is better, from its point of view, to ban it altogether.
“I understand that this is happening unintentionally,” said Stephen Parnis, the organization’s vice president.
But in the form in which boxing now exists, there will always be situations when an athlete receives a hemorrhage or brain injury, which leads to either death or severe damage.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with this.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional body that brings together medical practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against parliamentarians of the Russian Federation.
The speaker of the state Duma Sergei Naryshkin called unacceptable the introduction of sanctions against parliamentarians.
He said this while speaking at the session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar.
We regard this as an unacceptable act, as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
“And this should not be repeated, because it is a manifestation of political shamelessness and ignoring the principles of open international dialogue,” the politician said.
In addition, Naryshkin called on the participants of the OSCE PA to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let’s put morality back into politics.
Let us return dialogue and law to the practice of international communication.
Let us return humanistic ideals to a democratic world order.
“The duality never ended well,” he said.
Speaking from the rostrum of the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian State Duma called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on the members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security challenges.
“First, to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group,” Naryshkin said.
He also noted that the OSCE should be commended.
“This is almost the only common platform where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine,” the politician said.
Recall that the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, September 15, in Ulaanbaatar and will last until September 18.
Enjoyed the victory for a couple of days.
World champion in athletics Sergey Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumph for 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul Sergey Shubenkov.
He managed to win the European team championship at his crown distance of 110 meters with barriers, set several records, and most importantly - to become the world champion, and the first in the history of the domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final stage of the “Diamond League”, taking third place in the overall standings.
"New Izvestia" asked Shubenkov to share his impressions of the outgoing season.
Sergey, isn't the season over for you yet?
Yes, I am going to perform at the World War Games, which will be held in Korea in October, and then I will think about rest.
However, now I will prepare at home, in Barnaul, and being at home is still a completely different state.
It's easier than going around the world every week.
You once said that autumn is a favorite time of the year for you.
The end of August, the beginning of September is a wonderful time.
Passions after the main start of the season boiled, the burden of responsibility is no longer pressing.
You can compete in pleasure, on "relaxation".
Plus, you know, vacation's coming up...
Is there fatigue?
After all, the season is special, a lot of positive emotions...
Fatigue at the end of the season always builds up.
It doesn’t matter what you do, win or lose.
Every competition is stressful.
Constant flights, relocations - all this does not pass for the body without a trace.
You are tired physically and emotionally.
But now my emotions are definitely on the rise.
What the hell, I'm just happy!
By the time you finish the World Cup in Beijing, do you come back often?
It happens.
And you journalists don't let me forget that.
But in general, I think it’s bad for the athlete who lives by old victories to spin his successful races over and over again.
Enjoyed the victory for a couple of days - and we need to move on.
Was the preparation for this wonderful season very different from the usual?
I can’t say there was anything so special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter competition season.
He trained first at home in Barnaul, then at training camps, then again at home.
Same as usual.
But with the coach we set the task: to try to reach a new level, which I have not yet been.
Almost all the winter time was spent on laying the base.
We ran a lot of cross-country skids, did general physical training exercises, which included traction, squat, and we pumped our backs.
Then we took up barrier training, did a lot of technical work.
Did you see how the competitors were doing?
I always try to do this, the good in the age of the Internet with this there is no problem.
I watched the Winter European Championship, and there in the barrier sprint the whole pedestal was occupied by the French!
I also thought: you need to do something, dilute this company.
With every start this season you have added and added to the results.
Did it give you confidence?
The last few seasons have been pretty much the same way.
There's no way I'm running first at 13.20 and then at 13.50.
I always change my form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was to run out of 13 seconds.
All the work was aimed primarily at this result.
But the paradox is that you seem to feel that you are ready for feats, and it is not always possible to show your readiness at competitions.
What was it like at the Olympics in London?
I, to be honest, that semifinal race (Shubenkov could not get to the final. - "NI") tried to forget immediately.
He was really good, he could have run for 13 seconds.
And even if he had repeated his best result at that time, he would have become a bronze medalist of the Games.
But no luck.
Do you remember your first world championship?
What's the point?
It was in Taegu.
I really wanted to get into the final, there was such a program-maximum.
And fell right out of the morning, in the preliminary races.
Then I realized that tearing and carrying a broken head means that there is nowhere to run.
Two years later, at the World Cup in Moscow, he reached the final with the best time.
I remember well my feelings before the decisive race: I really wanted to win the “gold” even then!
How do you manage, developing a decent speed, not to lose your head, not to turn off?
And that's the hardest part.
You need to be very careful, focused on the technique, so as not to break down the barriers.
I noticed that when you tune in not to the result, but to the process, it is much easier.
And the most high, when you have a feeling that you are running and everything seems to work out by itself!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the hinterland after the first serious successes tend to move closer to the capital.
Have you ever had such thoughts?
It's better at home anyway.
I have no idea where I am without my coach, who needs me?
Maybe it would be good to have better conditions, but I try to be happy with what I have.
How long have you been together with Klevtsov?
Since I was 12 years old, ever since I got into athletics.
More precisely, first I trained with his wife, who worked with children, and then she passed me.
I started with a sprint, then a long jump, triple.
Children's all-around was - it's when they throw the ball, jump long from the place ...
At 14 I tried to run with barriers, and I liked it.
From the very first race it was possible to fulfill the standard of the second adult category.
That's the way it is.
Have you ever been afraid of barriers?
I was able to reach an agreement with them immediately.
I have always had to work a lot on technology.
He has suffered so much over the course of his life!
There is no escape from this routine.
The technique needs to be honed constantly - in order to wake me up at night, I would immediately get up and run through the barriers.
Everyone who has seen your race in Beijing claims that it was a very beautiful run.
Oh, thanks.
I liked it myself.
I don't usually go through my races, and I can't keep up.
But there is still work to be done on efficiency – there is no limit to perfection.
Aren’t you afraid now that the victory a year before the Olympic Games will fall on the shoulders of a heavy burden?
As they say in such cases, I will try to live up to expectations.
If he chooses this path, he must go to the end.
My coach likes to repeat: if you’re not weak, you shouldn’t feel any extra weight.
And I totally agree with him on that.
Otar Kushanashvili
Well, I’m not naive enough to be surprised by the reaction to the interview that took place in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, do not feed them bread - give, throw the enemy.
And although I didn’t wave the flag, and I said the same thing a million times here, and I didn’t call anyone a bastard directly, something else struck me.
All my pseudo-friends were gone in a second.
The pressure I'm subjected to is so strong that even I, who've seen the kinds of guys, think people are white-faced.
It's like you're walking, you're walking, and you're attacked by a crowd and you're stuck with bars.
But you have to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'm going to hit a howitzer, I'm old, guys, I'm scared.
The other thing is no support.
I didn't have any illusions, but now...
The best thing about me has always been self-sufficiency, so bite.
And only assholes can give passports to freaks like Fred Durst or Monson.
I'd rather be the best journalist in the world with a shameless job.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili sharply described the Crimean events:
What they did to the Crimean peninsula is a crime.
This is what is called annexation.
I believe that the reference to how Khrushchev tried to sign something, in no way fits into the overall picture of the human hostel.
It's like coming to a neighbor and taking his living space...
The war has gone from the Kremlin, and it will end only there.
I am almost 100% sure that, as in the summer of 2008, it started with the call of some bastard from the Kremlin prison.
I have a guess who it might have been...
Kobzon doesn't have much to live for.
I don’t understand, he’s the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Putin’s hands.
Is he going to lose his apartment?
Well, they took down his monument.
Of course, people remember him as an insult to his small homeland.
And reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise of the Seventh Leads the Ranking Despite the Ninth’s Attempts to Cover the Leaders’ Loss on Today Show
Karl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson’s trip to Canberra to cover the aftermath of the Liberal Party’s announcement to vacate the leadership post failed to significantly raise Today’s rating.
The morning show of the Ninth was broadcast from the state capital after Malcolm Turnbull's defeat of Tony Abbott.
The competitor, Sunrise, with its hosts David Koch and Samantha Armitage, is stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international broadcasts that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This long-distance torture didn’t seem to matter much to Australian viewers, with Sunrise’s audience of 397,000 in the five biggest cities compared to Today’s 339,000.
Today scored slightly higher than its ranking on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000 compared to Sunrise’s 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
As of September, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers compared to 314,000 for Today.
That's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the clarification!

The big news for Seventh was the stunning debut of 800 Words with former Packed to the Rafters star Eric Thomson.
A new drama about a recently widowed family father who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with his two children has gathered an impressive audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics speculated whether Thomson could handle the popular show alone, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result was a loud "yes" answer.
The X Factor 7 remained strong with an audience of 1.136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For the Seventh, luck and failure mixed on the second night of Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (from 17:00 to 17:30) of the new TV quiz, which was conducted by Andrew O'Keefe, gathered 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) the figure jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of Chase Australia drew 520,000 viewers, and the second half-hour drew an overwhelming 720,000.
Hot Seat raised 620,000.
The fall in Chase Australia ratings on the second night will make the Ninth quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute, which failed to outperform the McGuire show.

The three finalists are unanimous that "The Bachelor" Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
Is the secret revealed?
Lana Jevon-Fallows, Sarah McKay, and Snow White may have accidentally made it clear who would win in The Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood will eventually stay with in The Bachelor is surrounded by a veil of mystery.
And the three girls who reached the finals, of course, remain silent about which of them received his last rose.
But when we met with Sarah McKay, Snow White Marcoschi, and Lana Jevons-Fallows on the eve of the day when two of the three girls must be left, they may have inadvertently given a hint about the winner.
Sam Wood will remain silent until the final on Thursday.
All three women come into a lyrical mood, telling why Wood is the perfect man, while mentioning his sense of humor, dedication, family values, cheerfulness as the reasons why each of them would be happy to become his companion.
However, with their answers to the question "If not you, then who should get the last rose of Wood?" they could involuntarily suggest which of them really won the heart of "The Bachelor".
Jevons-Fellowes and Marcoskey no doubt called Mackay the perfect couple for Wood.
Sarah and Sam had a good relationship from day one.
“From the moment I was on the show, I felt Sam’s energy and Sam’s energy and I knew that they were very close and I had no doubt about that throughout the show,” Jevons-Fallowes said.
“Sarah is a very open person, she is easy and fun,” added Markoski.
I saw them together, there is a real attraction between them.
They feel great and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood will make a great couple.
McKay herself said that thanks to home visits last week, she realized that Wood may be “the same person.”
“As soon as I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized that it was definitely not just a game – I believed him with all my heart,” she says.
To the question of who should choose Voodoo, if it is not her, she answered mysteriously.
“I don’t know if I can talk about it,” she said.
I like both girls equally, and Snow White and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor show airs on Wednesdays at 7:30 p.m. on the Ten channel.
Originally published under the title "Sarah - the best choice of Sam Wood?"
Jarrett Hayne had several options for starting a career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle took a keen interest in him after his move to the U.S. — as did a host of other clubs that sent out inquiries after an impressive open training day late last year.
But Hain chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsoul and it seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball, which the former player of the Australian rugby league allowed on the first return of the hinge in the winning game with Minnesota with a score of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayne another chance to regain the hinge, and also involved him in the game after the injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula proved himself on the good side and after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of giving the rookies a break in the presence of the team, he cheered them up.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hain at a press conference after the match.
49ers special reporter Cam Inman said that Hain also received support from special teams coordinator Thomas McGoey, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarrid Hain lost the ball on the return of the hinge team "Minnesota Vikings" during the first quarter
This is the beginning of the debut in the NHL Hain and his numerous Australian fans clearly did not count.
He was seen scolding as he left the field after losing the ball, and later told the presenter of the show "Hamish and Andy" on the Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have imagined a more unsuccessful start for a career in the NFL.
“It happens, you just think about the next game and that’s it,” Hain said.
Hayne compared his miss to his debut in the Origin series in 2007, when throwing a ball in his scoring zone brought an attempt to Queensland.
In the end, this experience turned out to be very useful for the 27-year-old player.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under the threat of using weapons at a Siberian airport.
Openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated, and his attempts to develop democracy were thwarted.
On the border of Hungary there were clashes of migrants with the police.
Refugees staged protests on the border of Serbia near the Hungarian settlement of Reske, which escalated into clashes with law enforcement.
As a result, Hungarian police used water cannons and tear gas, Reuters reports.
Migrants throw stones at police officers and try to demolish a fence at the border.
Reinforcements are being sent to the scene of the clashes, and police are taking action in response to the aggressive actions of migrants and their attempts to violate the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, the refugees managed to break through the police cordon, after which dozens of migrants fled to the territory of Hungary.
Some refugees are leaving the Serbian-Hungarian border by bus towards Belgrade and the border with Croatia, the BBC reports.
The authorities of the country allowed migrants to enter the Croatian territory and ensure their transportation from there to the desired country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On September 15, the Hungarian parliament toughened legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provide for the participation of the army in the protection of state borders, criminal prosecution of those who illegally cross the border, as well as an accelerated procedure for the consideration of asylum requests.
A Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, and he will therefore be deported and will not be able to return to Hungary within one year.
Also, the Hungarian Parliament intends in the near future to consider the transfer to the armed forces of Hungary of the functions of border protection by the Parliament of the country.
In late June, Hungarian authorities began building a 175-km barbed wire fence on the border with Serbia to curb the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
The Russian admitted to committing the largest cyber attack in the history of the United States.
Accused in the largest cyber attack in U.S. history, Russian Vladimir Drinkman admitted to stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers, reports Reuters.
During the trial in the federal court of the state of New Jersey, Drinkman confessed to conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian told about the collusion with three citizens of Russia and a citizen of Ukraine, who are accused of cyber attacks on 15 companies.
The total damage from the actions of the defendants was estimated at $ 300 million.
“Counters like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack into our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, privacy, and national security,” U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said in a statement.
Drinkman faces 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine.
When sentencing, the court will take into account the confessions of the Russian and, possibly, reduce his term.
Drinkman will be sentenced on January 15.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitry Smilyanets, was taken into custody.
The latter denies his guilt in the crimes he is accused of.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risk of the Russian-backed regime of Bashar al-Assad.
During a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia’s support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is exacerbating the conflict in the country.
“Secretary Kerry has made clear that Russia’s support for President Assad risks exacerbating and expanding the conflict, as well as undermining our shared goal of countering extremism, unless we focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power,” the State Department said in a statement.
Kerry reaffirmed the US commitment to fight the Islamic State group (which is banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) as part of a coalition of more than 60 states.
According to the secretary of state, Assad “will never be able to be a reliable member” of the coalition.
During a telephone conversation, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria can be resolved only through a political transition from Assad.
The White House has threatened to isolate Russia because of its support for the Assad regime.
White House press secretary Joshua Earnest threatened Russia with isolation if it did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest suggested joining an international coalition that is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media often report the presence of Russian troops in Syria.
The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Sergei Lavrov, said that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and are helping Syrians to master the technique to use it against Islamists.
Four killed when police opened fire on protesters in Nepal with rubber bullets
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police fired rubber bullets at a crowd protesting the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandei district, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the country’s capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, the head of the district police, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered at a police station, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that police officers used tear gas, then fired into the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill, but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such a high mortality rate.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in southern, flat Nepal, where representatives of the Madezi people say the new provinces formed under the new constitution will reduce their political influence.
Protests have also taken place in western Nepal, among Taru citizens who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent clashes, starting with 10.
August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, was a crucial step towards a new constitution, but a highly contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for several centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers voted for articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said a new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create a company with 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 70s of the last century as a center of the chemical industry, has a developed infrastructure that requires system support.
A year ago, Sayansk was headed by a new mayor - Oleg Borovsky.
About the results of the first year of work, about new projects and prospects, he told the correspondent of "Regional".
Oleg Valerievich, how did you start working as a mayor?
First of all, I got acquainted with the results of audits of financial and economic activities, initiated an independent audit examination of the spending of local budget funds.
The municipal property was then audited.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the document flow to five days.
Previously, the papers on the instances could go for months.
Measures have been developed to increase the income base and optimize costs.
In November last year, a visiting meeting of the government was held in Sayansk, where issues of socio-economic development of the territory were considered.
In the city there was no design and estimate documentation (PSD) for any object.
Without this, Sayansk could not take part in federal programs.
We started with the preparation of the PSD for roads, kindergarten, northern sewerage and water supply.
Road works on two sections are already underway.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens implemented in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
Such a positive demographic in the city has not been observed in the last 27 years.
So the issue of providing places in kindergartens today is one of the most urgent.
Since September 1, the kindergarten No. 10, designed for 320 seats, has been closed for major repairs.
The estimated cost of repair is 86 million rubles.
The city has never received such funds.
Last year, after the renovation, kindergarten No. 23, which is now attended by 200 children, was opened.
The repair was made on the terms of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, its cost amounted to more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the help of the regional government, funds were found for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and the People's Initiatives program also helped.
There are plans to start building a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the order of children aged from one and a half to three years.
There are no waiting lists for children between the ages of three and seven.
Are investors interested in the area?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city should be engaged, first of all, in Sayan enterprises, it is they who need to be provided with work.
Already in October, a 60-apartment house for orphans in the Leningradsky microdistrict is put into operation.
As for construction, I will add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of the Angara region, which is included in the program for the construction of economy class housing.
All the necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 blocks will begin soon.
In total, we announced the construction of 10 thousand square meters of housing for those wishing to participate in the program a lot.
One of the conditions - housing should be no more than 30 thousand rubles per square meter, this cost includes a turnkey finish.
If we manage to cope with the set volumes, we will continue to participate in the program.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
At one time, the Sayan pork complex was being built on the territory, which in 2004 was sold for a pittance.
We are working with the prosecutor’s office to challenge this deal.
Especially since the land under the object is federally owned.
Work is underway with Moscow, the issue of transferring 88 hectares to the regional property is being resolved, with the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor who is ready to invest 1.5 billion rubles in the reconstruction and launch of the project.
With the launch of the pork complex, we will have 900 jobs, which will be a great help for the city.
Is the institute of social partnership developed in Sayansk?
We have concluded about 140 social and economic partnership agreements.
Many projects have been implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Substantial support is provided by such enterprises as JSC "Vostok-Center", Novo-Ziminskaya CHPP, LLC "Sayan Broiler", LLC "PC MDF", the management of these enterprises responds to all appeals.
Immediately on the Day of the city LLC "Sayan Broiler" gave the city a children's town, the company "East-Center" carried out the repair of the equestrian courtyard, where specialists deal with children andtherapy, spending more than 1 million rubles.
Thanks to sponsorship funds, it was possible to improve the territory of the city registry office.
Sponsors helped to celebrate City Day colorfully.
As in the good old days, a parade was held with the participation of city groups and organizations.
A chronicle of the city, a book of Sayan poets, was published.
The first builders and people who made a serious labor contribution to the development of Sayansk were awarded commemorative medals.
Patrons also participate in the work of the city charitable foundation.
The very first step was the acquisition of instruments for young talented musicians.
For nine months, more than 800 thousand rubles are aimed at supporting talented children, helping children in need of expensive treatment, and supporting children from low-income families.
How are human resources problems in the social sphere solved in Sayansk?
There is a shortage of doctors and teachers in the city.
Providing housing specialists is of great importance for resolving the personnel issue.
Over the past year, we have allocated five apartments for doctors, official housing received four teachers.
We have a program for the allocation of housing with the possibility of privatizing it in five years.
The plans include redevelopment of the building, in which eight more apartments for teachers will be built.
Also, teachers and doctors participate in the program "Housing for the Russian family".
In the future - the construction of a house for employees of the budget sphere.
Most importantly, the city has a workable team with which I can solve the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region is great.
The Duma introduced a bill on the indexation of social pensions, taking into account the increase in prices.
The State Duma introduced a bill providing for the indexation of social pensions annually from February 1, taking into account the increase in prices.
The author of the document - a deputy from "Fair Russia" Alexander Lomakin-Rumyantsev - also proposes to conduct additional indexation of pensions on April 1, if the growth rate of the subsistence minimum exceeds the growth rate of prices for goods and services.
The indexation of social pensions, according to the current legislation, is carried out annually from April 1, taking into account the growth rate of the subsistence minimum of a pensioner in the Russian Federation over the past year.
The draft law, introduced in the lower house, provides for the introduction of indexation of social pensions, taking into account the growth rate of consumer prices.
At the same time, the first indexation is postponed to February 1, and the second one is held on April 1.
The head of the OSCE PA told Mogherini about the inadmissibility of imposing sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs Federica Mogherini, the speaker of the OSCE PA Ilkka Kanerva said that sanctions against legislators participating in the events of the Assembly are unacceptable.
This was reported by a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar Nikolai Kovalev.
According to TASS, in support of Kanerva’s position, the signatures of European parliamentarians were collected, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, and Greece.
“There is already strong support,” Kovalev said.
Earlier, he said that the head of the OSCE PA expressed the intention to collect the signatures of deputies, which indicated the inadmissibility of imposing sanctions against parliamentarians.
In particular, Kovalev noted, Kanerva promised to raise this problem to the level of the leadership structures of the European Union and "send an appropriate petition."
The NHC reports that the probability of a cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands is 60 percent.
A broad front of the low-pressure region about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of Cape Verde islands has a 60 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure area roughly in the middle between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of forming a tropical cyclone in the next two days, weather forecasters from Miami say.
Google Launches Campaign to Double Donations to Raise $11 Million for Refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has announced a campaign to double its donations to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping displaced Europeans fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google took an uncharacteristic personal approach by announcing a fundraising campaign on its blog.
Instead of a statement from one of the executives, Google employee Rita Masood, who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
“We got on dubious trains and buses, endured hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has intensified, many people like my family are in desperate need of help.
The donations will go to four non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Médecins Sans Fronti<0xC3><0xA8>res, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would double the first $5.5 million in donations until the amount on the Google.com/refugeerelief page reaches $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, triggered largely by a four-year civil war in Syria that has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics with low obesity may be helped by obesity surgery
The beneficial effect after obesity surgery in people with low obesity who have type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say that diabetics with low obesity live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
“The mortality statistics don’t show up right away,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery, who wrote about the new study in a column for the editor of JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses a variety of techniques to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the ability of organisms to digest food.
Bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes for several years, but major studies have been conducted among people with morbid obesity who have a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight relative to height, is considered normal at 18.5 to 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates that a person is overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery — gastric bypass surgery and sleeve gastrectomy — with medical treatment for type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The average BMI of those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, BMI in those who received non-surgical treatment for diabetes remains at about the level of 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% were completely cured of diabetes, and partially - 28%.
In the group receiving medical treatment, for comparison, only 1% had a complete cure for diabetes, and only about 2% had a partial cure.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and “bad” LDL cholesterol were “generally better in the surgical group,” the authors said.
The researchers also monitored hemoglobin A1c levels in the blood, which reflect blood sugar levels in dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is better to keep below 7%, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, at about 8%.
But better glycemic control scores, reflected by good hemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce the death rate in five years, according to research leader Dr. Chi-Cheng Su and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of the two types of surgical treatment.
In the fifth year, compared with the arm gastrectomy group, the shunting group lost more weight (18.7 kg vs. 14.2 kg), achieved a greater reduction in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and was also closer to complete remission of diabetes (46.9 vs. 16.7%).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of surgery in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgical treatment does lead to an increase in life expectancy, according to Blackstone from the College of Medicine in Phoenix, University of Arizona.
According to a Swedish study for obese people who chose bariatric intervention, the likelihood of dying within 15 years was about 29% lower compared to the group that used more traditional methods.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this encourages people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in such a procedure.
“The report is very important here because it claims that such surgery is safe in a low-BMI group where there is no increased risk of mortality or kidney disease,” she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as a patient’s BMI falls in the range of 27 to 30.
“I think we’ve been waiting too long to get people to take this seriously,” she said.
It seems to me that once they accumulate the genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it’s very difficult to reverse that.
In Mytishchi, the robbers took out of the house fur coats and 9 million rubles.
In Mytishchi, the robbers attacked the residents of the Moscow house and stole from them 9 million rubles and three women's fur coats.
This is reported by "Interfax" with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident occurred on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown through the open front door entered the house located on Gorky Street, tied up the 20-year-old son of the owner of the house and, threatening with both knives, stole 9 million rubles and three fur coats.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles, a criminal case was initiated under the article "Robbery".
Fans in Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 St. Petersburg hotels have the right to host tourists who will come to see the World Cup in 2018.
The rest of the hotels are in no hurry to get a permit.
According to experts, this is a very alarming sign.
On the eve of the world championship, the authorities will urgently have to come up with how to resettle all the guests of the city.
The interlocutors of Rosbalt believe that due to the tournament, the cost of renting rental apartments will increase by 10-30%, and after the championship for rental housing will have to overpay.
The World Cup forced the authorities to pay attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to the law, written specifically for the championship, each hotel in St. Petersburg must pass the classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of service.
It is already clear that not everyone will be able to do this: hoteliers are so afraid of inspections that they often do not even send documents to the requests of the Federal Antimonopoly Service for St. Petersburg.
According to the head of the UFAS Vadim Vladimirov, the agency studied 138 hotels and now plans to start 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond to antimonopoly.
There are signs that the leadership of three dozen companies deceived citizens by placing a certain number of stars in advertising, Vladimirov said.
The problem is that now literally every number on the account, not one can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship fans will occupy all St. Petersburg hotels.
Now in the city tourists can count on 30,500 rooms.
According to Smolny, in St. Petersburg 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100 - two- and three-star, 550 - one-star.
According to the First Deputy Committee for Tourism Development of Nana Guichia, at the moment, only 23 hotels have been classified - so many inspections have been carried out by companies accredited in St. Petersburg.
But whether any hotel ordered a similar procedure from regional enterprises, Smolny is not known by an amazing coincidence.
That is, there may be more who have passed the classification, but no one knows about it.
“The last six months hotels are not very eager to pass the classification,” – said the Director of the North-Western branch of the Russian Union of tourism industry Ekaterina Shadskaya.
This is due to the high season, during which hoteliers earn the most money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason is the budgets in which the costs for inspections were not laid down, while the procedure can cost the hotel depending on the status of 30 to 100 thousand rubles or more.
But still, in recent years, hotel managers have become more active and began to apply for classification, assured Shadskaya.
Hotels need to have time until July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine, but also not get the right to work at the World Cup.
It is already known that, depending on the star rating, a fixed fee for a hotel room will be developed for the duration of the tournament.
The formulas by which the cost will be calculated will be published next year.
This is done in order to prevent the rise of prices by 200-300%, as it happens, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
It is necessary to have a conscience and not to allow an increase in two or three times, but hotels need to be given to earn.
“I think the growth will be up to 50%,” said the president of the Russian hotel association Gennady Lamshin.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not sure that price fixing corresponds to the understanding of the market economy.
I do not know how far this fits into the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
“It’s better than an unbridled trip,” he said.
It is not clear what will happen to popular cheap hostels.
Deputies of the state Duma introduced a bill according to which hostels should be banned in residential buildings.
We very much hope that this law will not be adopted or will not concern St. Petersburg.
“We will defend the view that hostels should be preserved,” Nana Gvachiya said.
However, according to her, the owners of mini-hotels in any case should be ready to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State Duma approves the bill, approximately 80% of hostels in St. Petersburg will be closed, and at the moment there are 1,500 rooms in them.
According to the President of the Federation of Restaurateurs and Hoteliers of the North-West Leonid Garbar, in St. Petersburg there is a shortage of two- and three-star hotels, which are just in demand by football fans, but there is a skew towards hotels with four and five stars.
This state of affairs is similar to the situation when "75 thousand VIPs sit in an 80,000-strong stadium."
This can be done through mini-hotels.
The expert considers their possible ban "idiotism": "I think it strange that some people can live in apartments, but for some reason visitors can not."
If the hostel is used as a hostel, then I agree that this is wrong.
But if it’s like a hotel where guests come for a short period of time, then why not?
Mini-hotels are at risk of missing the World Cup and because of their inefficiency.
Hundreds of small hotels simply do not have time to pass the classification, and the hole is digging itself.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will order works.
“Companies that can carry out this procedure are not so many, so they will refuse less paid orders from mini-hotels, and will choose those that will travel,” said Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, the rates of passed inspections at the moment are much higher than those of St. Petersburg.
The reason for the St. Petersburg delay is associated, among other things, with constant rearrangements in the government’s tourist block, which does not contribute to coordinated work.
According to experts, if St. Petersburg hotels are not enough for everyone, it is likely that you will have to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday homes.
According to the example of the celebration of the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg in the city can mobilize the river fleet, that is, the guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many fans are prepared to come in vans, in which you can spend the night.
“The main thing is not to set up so many hotels so that they are empty afterwards,” Gennady Lamshin is sure.
Also very popular during the football championship will be rented housing.
Most likely, a reserve of rented apartments will be created in the city.
Rent rates will increase by 10-30%.
"From the obvious - the first will leave the housing near the stadium," - said the specialist for rental Agency for development and research in real estate Larisa Bragina.
Moreover, the rental price may not return to its previous level after the championship, especially in sleeping areas.
This will be facilitated by the construction of new transport interchanges on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
Do not forget about the human qualities of citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is sure that St. Petersburg has always been a hospitable city in which people do not just tell the way, but can also hold a mini-excursion.
There are complications.
In 1970, my father met a family from Murmansk in the yard - father, mother and two children.
They had nowhere to sleep: it was difficult with hotels at that time, it was difficult to sleep at the station.
"And Dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," the interlocutor recalled.
However, he added that now there are no such features in the residents of the city - to call home is fraught with consequences and is scary.
But maybe in 2018, after the unsuccessful decisions of the State Duma, the mistakes of hoteliers and governments will have to remember the past?
Zhirinovsky "merged" the Amur region.
With admiration today looked at the clown Zhirinovsky in the state Duma.
He did things like that when our generation was just learning how to trade newspapers, and he's still in great shape.
The theme of the speech, it seems, is "the protest of the LDPR against the results of the elections in the Amur region."
Protocols do not shake - for there is nothing; other protocols, except those signed by election committees, the LDPR, apparently, does not.
Here he picks up the runner-up Ivan Abramov and shouts something like: "Here is the winner of the election!"
And then suddenly rushes to Rodnina, and then, after an altercation with the chairman, withdraws the faction from the conference room, shouting literally "You are all with the fronts of your crooks and thieves."
The press, of course, does not focus on Abramov, but on the scandal and the demarche of the faction as a consequence of this scandal and insult.
In reality, Wolfovich beautifully and elegantly merged the Amur region with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is another Zhirinovsky's "Socks!"-style prank, and not a protest of a political party against the results of a specific election.
And the faction has formally scandalized, and the elections, if you believe the party website and Facebook Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the leader obviously gets off the topic.
He allows the dead on the Amur to bury their own dead, and he preaches against "United Russia" in general and in no way an innocent relative.
An elegant solution to not lose face, and in a real, not ostentatious scandal not to go.
Another thing is that now Abramov himself is in a strange situation.
Except for the screams from the authorities, he did not wait for anything, there are no alternative protocols on his hands.
He is not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, and on the other - for a narrow circle, it was he who became a formal occasion for insulting the respected champion, and, even more importantly, Ham attacks on the EP and the ONF.
And then, of course, he needs to seriously think about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the elections, the politician number 2 of the region and the candidate number 1 for the only regional single-mandate district, it can turn into a pariah, which has been successfully used by its own party leadership and super-irritant for the same ONF and the party leadership of someone else.
Certainly - there would be no Zhirinovsky, it would have to be invented and respectfully observed.
Trump is still growing and growing.
There was news that the LDPR will return to the hall during the next plenary session.
The bathroom fell out of nothing.
The only thing is, Abramov buried the topic under himself.
Beautiful indeed.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists has called for an end to violence in countries that are home to refugees.
The Dalai Lama touched on the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama’s Compassion Center in Oxford, dedicated to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that in the current circumstances, the interests of humanity should be higher than the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that while this is admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate to the situation.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama spoke highly of the actions taken by Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, he stressed that this is only a temporary solution.
“Taking care of thousands of refugees is fine, but at the same time you have to think about long-term solutions to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries,” he said.
After all, we have to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
Speaking about the violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George W. Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying that the harsh reaction of the United States launched a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that a solution to this problem was possible through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force and it caused unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who swallowed hand sanitizer in the last 4 years
Toxicology centers in the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age who swallowed an alcohol-rich hand sanitizer since 2010, according to the Georgia Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Toxicology Center, cases of children under 12 years of age ingesting hand sanitizers reported to toxicology centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children come into contact with these substances more often, and unfortunately some percent of them go to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink the disinfectant fluid on purpose, and some do it to impress their friends, or to argue for social networks.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking disinfectant liquids as cheap drinks.
The teenagers reportedly mixed a disinfectant liquid with an alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted by the pleasant smells of disinfectant liquid.
“The child doesn’t think it’s going to hurt him,” Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (disinfecting hand liquids) are those that are flavored.
There are hand sanitizers with the smell of strawberries, grapes, oranges, which are very attractive for children.
Hand sanitizer contains anywhere from 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, especially a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
“It’s a high-concentration alcohol,” said Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief physician of the Toxicology Center at the University of Kansas Hospital.
You wouldn’t just leave a glass of whiskey, but people keep these hand sanitizers in sight, and if kids get to them, it’s a quick way to consume large amounts of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed a strawberry-flavoured hand sanitizer in school, was sent to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice that of an adult who is legally considered to be intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naija confused words and could not walk when she was taken to the emergency room.
Doctors watched her through the night in a separate children’s clinic to ensure she didn’t miss any signs of brain injury as the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchie said.
“It was very scary,” Ortoria Scott, Naiji’s mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic substances or disinfectant wipes, in addition to removing hand sanitizers from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant liquids have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than the ethyl alcohol that was listed as the active substance.
In January, three fourth-graders in upstate New York conspired to poison their “bad” teacher by “spreading antibacterials in the classroom,” according to a police report.
The teacher has a strong allergy to hand sanitizers, and she forbade keeping them in her class.
Police believe the failed plan was “empty talk” and address disciplinary issues to the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the regional children's library named after N.K. Krupskaya sad cast-iron owl.
The kids who come for the books are trying to feed her sweets.
It has been in the library for 95 years.
The very first readers in the twenties of the last century arranged loud readers here, staged performances based on Mayakovsky’s poems, conducted literary quizzes and corresponded with Lenin’s wife.
The correspondence lasted four years, and, as the newspaper "Young Stalinets" wrote in 1939, every day "the friendship between Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya and friends of the children's library of the city of Barnaul" became stronger.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna even once sent her children’s photo to distant Barnaul friends.
And when the Barnaul people asked whether Nadezhda Konstantinovna did not mind that the library be given her name, she wrote that she did not mind.
Letters have long been dusted in the museum, and the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the first readers have to explain whose severe profile adorns the bas-relief on the library building.
In the years of perestroika, different people often called, indignant: why is the children's library not renamed?
Let there be a library named after some good children's writer, without political coloring!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it is.
"Krupskaya" is perhaps the most famous and favorite library in Barnaul, as a "leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby is a path of yellow brick.
"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is the favorite theme of the artist Olya Moskovka.
Previously, Olya was a manager in a law firm, came to work at eight, left at five, and from all other managers differed only love of drawing.
And then I found an ad on the Internet that said, "I need an illustrator for a book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "My mother has cancer."
Olya did illustrations, and thought that life could end at any moment, and there would be no miracles in it if you did not create them yourself.
Now she works in the library, illustrates children's books of writers around the world and writes fairy tales herself.
Traditionally, it is believed that children lose interest in the book, that they are increasingly living in some kind of virtual space.
But reading children come to us, and their parents understand the importance of reading, - says Tatiana Kushvid, the director of the library.
In recent years, we have even had such a moment of confidence that the children's library is needed, and it will live - the kids are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is back.
In the lobby of the library hangs a large exhibition stained glass with an updated photo exhibition.
Once a quarter are posted new photos of readers who go to the library with the whole family: mom, dad and children.
The library is pleased that with the children more and more began to come dads.
If at two years the child was read all Chukovsky, then at an older age he needs books more difficult.
But now there is a law according to which an eight-year-old prodigy is forbidden to issue books from the category 12+.
To get such a book, the child must bring his parents with him - they come, then return again, and gradually "Krupskaya" becomes for them something like a family club.
There are treasures in the library - a pre-revolutionary collection of epics with hives and eras, the story of Korolenko in the appendix to the magazine "Niva", the lining of "Murzilki" for 1936.
After all, we are now not only the conceptual space of the “temple of the book”, we are now open to movement, we are trying to become a special place: not a home, not a job, not a school,” explains Tatiana Kushvid.
You can come to us to read, play, draw together.
We made a play area for the kids - the child comes just to play, and the hand is still reaching for the book!
Some of our readers are carried away by their parents, and they resist with their feet, do not want to leave.
Often come moms with strollers - and we are pleased that they put the library in the first place among all the other places where you need to come with the kids.
Tatiana Kushvid says: modern children, as well as we once loved classical children's literature:
“Publishing is now evolving, and a lot of attention is being paid to authors who are the link between generations.”
And if we talk about small children, it is important for them that there is some kind of hero who travels from one book to another.
Kids don’t like to break up with their heroes.
The library constantly produces booklets for parents, in which it tells what is happening in modern children's literature, which books are worth paying attention to and why.
The booklets are so fascinating and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
It is forbidden to take books outside the reading room for adults.
This magical privilege is only available to children.
In the farthest room of the library there is a square hatch with an ancient wooden staircase to the basement, to the book depository.
The steps will creak under your feet - this is a very old time machine.
With the book of your childhood, you meet like an old friend: hello, it's good that we do not change.
Ellie is still having fun walking along the road paved with yellow bricks, the lazy Tola Ryzhikov steals magic matches, and the Kid-Kybalchish has never told the damned bourgeois of the Military Secret - he has such a firm word.
Such books are like passwords, you can recognize your own anywhere by them.
There are also real book rarities in the vault - for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of biline with hives and eras.
Or take Korolenko in the famous appendix to the magazine "Niva".
Or the 1936 Murzilki liner.
Time has aged the pages, painted them in tea color.
These books are no longer available to readers.
These are fragments of our future collection, I dream of everything - I will retire and do rare children's books.
But the children are already, so to speak, will not do it: and the colors in the old books are not very bright, and the themes ... open the first page, and there - Lenin, the party, the Komsomol.
Now it seems: why did we all write this "Pioneer's Truth?"
But it was still interesting, - tells "Russian planet" Galina Ilyasova, head of the library.
The pages of "Murzilki" have darkened from time to time.
Galina Vasilievna has been in charge of the library all her life.
She knows what colour Buratino’s cap is, what school year Harry Potter became the captain of Gryffindor’s Quidditch championship team, in what situations Carlson uses a silencer for a motor, and who Alice Selezneva’s father works for.
Librarians are paid little for their work, and all who can live without these books quickly find another profession.
Only the most convinced remain: educators, educators, employees of the cult of the book.
They can also be recognized by a smile - it is believed that this is a professional trait of a children's librarian.
If he smiled at you in the first minute of the conversation, he is a professional.
I love children's books in general: as a librarian I like them to be, to stand neatly and beautifully on the shelves, and I also love to read them, - says Galina Vasilievna.
I read everything: military, historical stories, fairy tales, fiction.
I read modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think everything was different in my childhood.
The books were the most interesting and exciting of all that was happening to me then.
And because I loved them so much, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone is sitting and reading.
I hope that books will always be, despite the riders.
And I am glad when our former readers bring children, or even grandchildren...
Rumor mill: In "Seltika" there are no disagreements
Griffiths has denied talking about disagreements at Celtic after admitting to Dale that Hoops is in a bad position, but he will fix it.
Harts will protest the Scottish Football Association's claim to Neilson, and Warburton is afraid of signing contracts in January that could break the team's unity.
"Dons" increased the advantage over Celtic to five points
Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half gave Aberdeen a small advantage over Hamilton in Pittodry, which allowed Dons to break away from Celtic by five points.
Griffiths denied the talk of disagreements
This sparked rumors of a dispute in Celtic, which was cut short by Griffiths, who said he and his teammates were not suffering from any increased criticism as they prepared to meet with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don’t think we’re feeling the tension, I think the players are striving for it.
The Dutch are bored, because the Scots are not in the fight for the title - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team member Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because he is not competing for the title with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an Ajax spokesman, said: “In Holland, the most attractive moments of the Celtic games are no longer shown, but why?”
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together, and that’s what they’re interested in.
There’s a lot of tension in the Old Firm games, and it’s not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," Dale said.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Celtic was going through difficulties, but the Norwegian coach vowed to change everything.
The defeat from Malm<0xC3><0xB6> and, as a result, the withdrawal from the Champions League was soon followed by the loss of 10 Aberdeen players, who now, having broken away by five points, occupies the top line of the table.
However, Dale said: “Selitek had bad periods before, and we will come out again.”
We want to get out of this as quickly as possible.
I understand that it’s very annoying, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what’s going on.
So do we, but we have to keep going.
And we really, really need the support of Celtic, because that makes the players much better.
Staying together is so important now.
Warburton looks forward to January transfers
Despite opinions that emerged just a couple of weeks ago suggesting that he had identified some of the goals of the January transfers, Ranger boss Mark Warburton is suspicious of the January campaign, arguing that he does not want to destroy the unity of the team.
A former Brentford striker said: “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the start of the season to adapt them, which you have seen in our own group this season.
The team is working really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Michu, who is interested in Celtic, hinted at the end of his career
Swansea striker Mitchu, linked to Celtic during the transfer window, hinted that he could leave football after his contract with the Swans ended.
The 29-year-old suffered from ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
Harts are going to confront the SFA about the statements of Neilson
The Harts led 2-1 when Patterson was removed, and lost 3-2, but the defender's red card was later cancelled; this was Collum's third red card to be cancelled in eight months.
Neilson does not give up on his words, stating: "I did not question ethics, I did not comment on the game."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tyncastle
Stubborn player of the team "Hybernian" received a reprimand after admitting that he sang a song with offensive words about the former player of the "Harts" Rudy Scatzel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before the start of the Edinburgh derby on Tynecastle in March 2014.
“It was a derby and it was hot,” the striker said, adding: “I can say with confidence that I wasn’t going to return to Tynecastle if he didn’t play for Celtic.”
Donnelly: Tannadis board confident in Dundee United management
Simon Donnelly argues that Dundee United's board of directors remains confident that the management team will change the situation for the better, but agrees that the deterioration of the situation on the field should end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare the guys to come out again,” Donnelly said.
McInnes is pleased that “ugly” won at “Hamilton”
Derek McInnes admitted that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against Hamilton Assisi to achieve a seventh consecutive league win, putting them five points above Celtic, at the top of the standings, thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half.
McInnes said: “There is no team here that has won anything – a cup, or a league championship – that has not won a meeting in this way.”
The unemployment rate among Scots does not change, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is growing.
Unemployment in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9%, was higher than the UK rate of 5.5%, according to figures from the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, with 2,612,000 now employed.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0% for the quarter, above the United Kingdom average of 73.5%.
David Mandell, Scotland’s minister of affairs, said: “The government’s long-term plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy.
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen a further improvement in the Scottish labour market, with employment rising and unemployment falling.
Why I Witnessed the Oklahoma Execution
Today, evading legal intervention at a late stage, I will watch a man be executed.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn’t, I’ll be sitting on a death row viewing gallery in Oklahoma State Prison when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The first time this request was made was back in January, through a close friend of his, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As that day drew near, I became afraid.
Then why do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed story about the death penalty.
This would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since there are often more people willing to attend than seats, the results of the grim lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press seats was reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will look at it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I’ll be sitting with Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and he and I started our own relationship after months of phone calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I cannot be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to write down what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of giving in to my impartiality.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have formulated it better," but still believes that I am wrong in what I do.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of what I said and wrote.
He didn’t tell me what to write, and I wouldn’t do it even if he did.
I told him he could cross me off his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that publicity will help the movement for the abolition of the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I recorded.
I will not go into detail here again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip isn't guilty.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treese make him guilty of aiding and abetting the crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that the evidence for the death penalty was not enough.
I think his execution was wrong.
And from that perspective, I'm gonna watch him die.
I can’t say I’m completely objective.
There will be other reporters that you can reach out to.
You will learn from me what it is like to watch a person I like die needlessly.
A man being chased by the police was persuaded to get out of the Canning River
The constable from the town of Cunning Vale managed to persuade a man to get out of the Cunning River, and himself to stay dry.
A resident of Perth intended to leave the police, but could not, stuck in dirty water in shallow water a few meters from the police officer, trying to "softly persuade him to go ashore."
Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday to investigate an illegal break-in in Buckingham.
When the police spotted the suspect, he tried to get away from them, rushing into Canning.
But he didn't go far.
“He was standing in the water and saying, ‘I’m not going to come out, come on, grab me,’” Sgt. Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Lachlan Perchavets did not want to wet his uniform, so he used a safer method - "negotiating with a good policeman."
“Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape,” says Sgt. Castledine.
Football champion Ben Cousins is what he remembers.
In 2006, Casins drove into a ditch to avoid meeting with a police patrol to check for alcohol, and tried to swim over to Swann.
His efforts proved to be in vain, but prompted locals to invent the comic "Ben Casins biathlon".
Peter Moody Accuses Stewards of Attempting Espionage and Threatens to Quit Equestrian Sports
Peter Moody has accused Racing Victoria stewards of trying to smuggle a spy into his stable last year and has threatened to immediately abandon the equestrian sport.
He was targeted by stewards and employees of the Racing Victoria ethics department, whom he accused of organizing a campaign against him personally, and the removal of Lady Tatai from the start due to a violation of the rules of use of drugs on the day of the start, on Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always makes every effort to participate in the races, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of Lidari’s test for cobalt, which he cannot explain.
He kept his mouth shut about suspicions of espionage for a year and a half and didn’t want it to “look like a green grape.”
“I wasn’t going to say anything about it, and I’ve put up with it for a long time, but sometimes it gets you so out of line that you can’t hold back,” Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to go through the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
Today I will go home and sleep soundly.
I want to walk with my head held high and I want my owners to know that I am doing everything I can for them.
When they start to think that’s not the case, then I’m going to have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody sensationally stated during an interview on racing.com that the ethics department tried to spy in his stable.
“A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a person I would name if asked and offered him a job in my stable to pass on information about what I was doing in my stable,” Moody told Racing.com.
They clearly think I'm a fraud.
If this is the case, they should all undoubtedly file applications, as they failed to catch me.
Robert Rolston, the former chairman of RVL, David Moody, the current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondry, RVL’s current CEO, knew about it all along and know it now.
Shouldn't that make me think it's personal?
Shouldn’t RVL have the courage to hold people other than coaches accountable for what’s going on in this business?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think it is.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now may make them think about it.
But I've come to a point now where I don't care, and it makes me sad.
I'm really sad about this.
I will put pressure on them and give them the responsibility to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The coach’s annoyance only grew in the course of a long investigation into the cobalt and Lidari case, and the latest horse removal from the start made him say he could “throw his license on the table.”
Moody, best known for preparing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the requirements for the use of drugs on the day of the competition "ridiculous" after a clay compress was applied to the horse's legs, which is a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the rules of the race.
“I have to take full responsibility for this,” he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put a compress on her leg.
She could have gotten a compress last night.
She could have gotten it yesterday, just like she did.
She was with him the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months under competition rules for the use of a compression garment on the day of the competition, which the stewards have opened an investigation into.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
“We all understand that we need rules, but it’s gone too far,” Moody said.
Driver who drove and fled from the scene of the incident in Cobram arrested
Police arrested a man who shot down a motorcyclist in Cobram over the weekend and fled the scene.
The motorcyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of the city of Natalia surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with leaving the scene, failing to provide assistance and violating other traffic rules.
The motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Cobram, remains in the hospital in stable condition.
Coach “Melbourne Storm” Craig Bellamy trumps the accusations of rivals in the use of hard power techniques
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called criticism of his team's interception of the ball an "imposition of an agenda" by two NRL championship favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm to "fight" his team during a sudden Storm victory in the final of the qualifying game in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a clear reference to Storm after his team won the final of the qualifying tournament at the Northern Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game "typical" for the rugby league and said two of the Queensland team were not "successful."
Bellamy defended the interception of the ball by his team and stated that they were just focused on "contact" by intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was reassured by the criticism of his team from the two leading coaches, as this means that they are worried about a possible defeat from the “Storm”.
“It keeps popping up – I didn’t hear Trent Robinson talk about tough moves when they beat us 24-2,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we have not changed anything in our systems or defense techniques for a whole year, just in the last six weeks we have paid special attention to the contacts when intercepting the ball, and this was a turning point for us.
Trent has been there for three years and he’s obviously coaching a great team, so he’s probably not used to losing and it’s been a bit of a shock for him.
It’s funny how this always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea of "impressive football", reminding his teacher that the St. George-Illavarra Dragons won Bennett's championship in 2010, showing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night, and see how impressive their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember back in 2010, St. George got a lot of criticism for being a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can show what he considers impressive football, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
It’s the kind of football you want to play when you have players like that.
He made that remark in 2010 and now he wants everyone to play football in his style – not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they’re a bit worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably weren’t thinking about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the game "Storm" and "Rusters" was a competition with more points than the game "Broncos" and "Cowboys".
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven’t seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game he was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and what, this is impressive football?
Or to consider impressive breaks and unsuccessful attempts?
It's routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can meet them there.
Storm will have a weekend at the end of this week, as they won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Kronalla Sharks next Saturday night at the preliminary finals at AAMI Park Stadium, tickets go on sale next Tuesday morning.
Accused of drug possession, Serb released on bail of 200 thousand dollars
A man facing life in prison for trying to appropriate 40kg of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on the Solay yacht, which was sailing from South America through Vanuatu and moored in Kumera in August.
Throughout the morning, Maksimovich and his accomplices were seen on the pier, and later he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kg of the drug in the Toyota Echo car.
Despite the fact that Maksimovich faces a life sentence for trying to appropriate drugs in an amount sufficient for sale, Maksimovich’s lawyer claims that there is no evidence that the latter tried to get the whole lot, and that the man could be in the cafe without any intention.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximovich should have been released on bail.
The latter has links with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maximovich’s mother and stepfather were offered a $200,000 bail for his release.
“From the testimony of both, it is clear that the $200,000 bail is too much of a financial burden for them,” Judge Flanagan said.
But this measure alone is not enough as a guarantee that it will not disappear, the judge added.
Maksimovi<0xC4><0x87> was allowed to be released on bail on the condition that he surrenders both his Australian and Serbian passports, is registered with the police daily and observes a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotis Katsikaris: “I am proud of Greece, which fought until the last seconds.”
The head coach of the national team of Greece Fotis Katsikaris paid tribute to his team after the match of the 1/4 finals of the Eurobasket-2015 with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game was decided by individual mistakes.
It was a big game," Katsikaris told AFP.
We were preparing for a great game played by the Spaniards.
They tried to work out in defense, but mistakes in defense determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: "In CSKA I will be entrusted with the functions of Kaunas."
CSKA newcomer Joel Freeland said that he does not believe in the curse of the army.
The Briton also expressed confidence that his new club will be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I spoke with coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, I will actually be assigned the functions of Sasha Kaun, who left the team, both in defensive constructions and in the attack from the three-second zone, and I think I can deal with that.
Yes, I will need some time to rebuild to the position of the center, after all, in the NBA, I played more as a forward.
Now it will be necessary to confront the big centers of the opponent more, but I have already done this before, so I think I can handle it now.
The last time the army won the Euroleague was in 2008.
Since then, they have made it to the Final Four six times, but each time they couldn’t show their best basketball.
There is an opinion that the team was looted.
That's the game, you can't win forever.
“Of course it’s difficult, I understand the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we are capable of, then we have a good chance to win the Euroleague, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, Muscovites have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of CSKA.
As for the evil eye, I am not a superstitious person and do not believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you put these two things together, anything is possible.
I don’t have any specific rituals before the games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Luis Enrique: “For me, the match against Roma will be special.”
The head coach of Barcelona Luis Enrique did not hide that he returned to Rome for the match of the 1st round of the group tournament of the Champions League with Roma with special feelings.
According to the mentor, the face-to-face fight of his current and former team will be far from ordinary for him.
Recall that Luis Enrique trained "wolves" in the season 2011/12, but failed to prove himself from the best side in the capital of Italy.
I returned to Rome after a few years, during which I gained some experience. - quotes the official website of UEFA the words of Luis Enrique.
I have very fond memories of Rome.
It’s going to be a special game for me, but it’s not that important.
The main thing is to start in the Champions League with a victory.
The August meeting at the Cup of Joan Gamper will not affect the actions of the teams in the next match.
I expect Roma to play in Serie A against Juventus.
“It’s a strong team that knows how to press and knows what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: Krasnodar has different options for attacking actions.
Acting head coach of "Ural" Vadim Skripchenko on the eve of the match of the 9th round of the Premier League with "Krasnodar" noted the variety of attacking schemes of the opponent's team.

The fight will take place on September 21 and will begin at 16.30 Moscow time.
How we will play with "Krasnodar", we will see, - the official website of "Ural" says Skripchenko.
We have a whole week of preparation ahead of us.
This team has different options for attacking actions, multifacetedly carries out its attacks, at the same time and we are not a slow team, so I think it will be a very interesting game.
On the eve of this game, given that Krasnodar is holding a Europa League match against Borussia Dortmund, we will try to prepare very well to win.
Roger Ca<0xC3><0xB1>as: “At home, Astana can take away anyone’s glasses.”
Astana midfielder Roger Ca<0xC3><0xB1>as after the match of the 1st round of the group tournament of the Champions League with Benfica (0:2) expressed confidence in improving the quality of the game of his team in the future.
According to the midfielder, in their field, the Astanais are able to take away points from any opponent.
Despite the fact that the match turned out to be difficult for us, I can say that we played well, - quotes the official website of UEFA words Kanyas. - We did not have enough courage in the attack.
“Benfica is above class, but in the home game, I think we can count on taking away their points.
It's quite real.
But first you need to think about Galatasaray, and then about Atletico.
In home matches, we can take away points from anyone.
Rafael Ben<0xC3><0xAD>tez: “I’ll say it as many times as I want: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world.”
The head coach of “Real” Rafael Benitez expressed satisfaction with a major victory in the match of the 1st round of the group tournament of the Champions League with Shakhtar (4:0).
The specialist paid tribute to forward Cristiano Ronaldo, who became the author of three goals.
The match was not easy, because Shakhtar knows how to own the ball, - quotes the official UEFA website the words of Benitez.
The opponent did not have many moments, but their counterattacks are always fraught with danger.
I won’t say that Real Madrid played perfectly, but we had plenty of opportunities.
I’m happy that we didn’t miss the ball and scored four.
Cristiano Ronaldo has confirmed his level.
He's the best player in the world, I'll say it as many times as I can.
Jordi Alba: "Cristiano Ronaldo can not be compared to Messi".
Barcelona defender Jordi Alba believes that his team-mate Lionel Messi can not be compared.
According to the Spaniard, the Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo can not do it either.
"Messi is five goals ahead of the rest," Le Figaro quoted Alba as saying, "What Leo can do, nobody can do.
Not even Cristiano Ronaldo.
With Leo on the field, everything changes, I can’t compare him to anyone.
Daniele De Rossi: “Barcelona” has not only a unique style, but also bright personalities.
Roma midfielder Daniele De Rossi on the eve of the Champions League group tournament match with Barcelona noted the importance of compactness and safety in the game with such a strong opponent.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, the beginning - at 21.45 Moscow time.
We will remind, "SE" will hold its text broadcast.
"Barcelona is a special rival, a good team with great players," De Rossi said.
It is difficult to play with blue-garnets, because they have not only a unique style, but also bright personalities.
To leave them, we will have to plow throughout the match and protect each other.
Messi is almost always successful when it comes to the cover, so we need to keep it compact and organized.
Yezhov hopes to get out in the starting line-up of the SKA in the match with Slovan.
SKA goalkeeper Ilya Yezhov stressed that he hopes to enter the starting line-up of the army in the next match of the KHL championship.

The next match the team will hold on the road against Slovan.
I hope to get out in the next match in the starting line-up, - quotes "R-Sport" the words of Yezhov.
I’m not an expert on goalkeepers, I’m a goalkeeper myself, we don’t show repeats of missed goals, so it’s difficult to track down.
“Dynamo played well, everyone has bad matches.
The team lost anyway.
I would have missed more, but the team won.

Stephen Hogg used a girl’s phone to force paedophiles to send photos
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to solicit images of child abuse.
Stephen Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, registered with the Internet messaging service, where he received a number of obscene images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found the missing phone and found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She checked it out and found shocking photos, then immediately drew her mother’s attention to it.
The police arrived and saw five images, after which they examined the computers found at that address and found “relevant” search queries using words to detect obscene images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he did it because it could “attract paedophiles” and then he would “pretend to be a policeman to scare them.”
Commissioner Ailee Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff’s Court: “He said it was an addiction, he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he made requests on the computer, but said that it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about a conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and that he asked to send more photos.
He said he was doing it to lure them.
He said he had problems with his head when he was drinking and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: “When the girl found the photos on her phone, she called her mother, shivering and crying.
She saw the obscene images on the phone, and then a full-time bet was made with the accused.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the defendant used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges of making obscene photos of children on June 14 last year, violating bail conditions on January 25 this year and failing to appear in court for a hearing on March 24 this year.
Defendant’s lawyer Gregor Sim requested that Hogg not be included in the list of sexual offenders, as it could be proved that there was no “significant sexual element” in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October, before receiving a certificate from the social services.
Hogg was released on bail in the case, but was taken into custody prior to hearings on other remaining cases.
He was listed as having committed sexual offences before the date of his conviction.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe gives the wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell from the podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video with the scene of the fall instantly spread on social networks.
The opening of the parliament was also overshadowed by statements by parliamentary oppositionists that they had received anonymous threats warning them against booing Mugabe at the time of the address.
A month ago, they booed the president during his address to the nation in parliament, a speech that Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
Mugabe’s deputy for the Movement for Democratic Change, Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interrupt Mugabe’s speech.
“The message came from a number that is not displayed, but it is entitled ‘Death,’” he told reporters at the end of Mugabe’s speech.
Noted members of parliament it warned that immunity ends in the Parliament building, and as soon as they leave, parliamentary immunity does not apply.
A member of parliament said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was “concerned” about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and service cost reduction program.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will split into two listed companies, separating the production of computers and printers from the more rapidly developing sectors of hardware and service operations.
The deductions resulting from the projected job cuts will amount to approximately $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, Hewlett-Packard said in a statement.
“Such restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, which will lead the organization after the split.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than Hewlett-Packard currently, and the business portfolio will be broader and deeper, which will help the company transition to a new style of business,” said Whitman.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and “will focus on providing previously unattainable end-to-end technology solutions” to companies, the company said in a statement.
This is how the company, formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard for the production of electrical equipment, is divided; their garage in Palo Alto was called the "birthplace of Silicon Valley."
Hewlett Packard is in the process of a major reorganization with the aim of moving from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
Such a move by HP, the world’s second-largest PC maker and one of the largest tech companies in the U.S., is the latest development in the sector based on the belief that highly specialized companies perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says his teammates should support the injured Jack Wilshire before playing with Dinamo Zagreb
In a conversation with Wilshere, Wenger also stressed that it is only September and that provided Wilshere’s recovery goes as planned, nothing will prevent him from returning to the game by Christmas.
At the most favorable development of events, Wilshire will definitely miss at least four next games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains in question.
The most unfortunate thing about this recent problem is that Wilshire confidently ended the previous season with a single ankle injury and was going to return to the usual aggressive style of play during pre-season training.
Wenger: “This injury doesn’t threaten his career.”
It's just not a fully healed bone.
It's nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or injuries he's had before.
These may be medically related things, but as Wenger also admitted, there is a risk of additional injury for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavorable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has recorded 23 different injuries that have happened to him in the six years since his debut.
In addition, he has only played in 65 of Arsenal’s 157 league games in the last five seasons.
If you look at the schedule for Arsenal wider, you can see that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two clubs in the Premier League, which account for the most days missed due to injuries.
Wenger admits the possibility of getting stuck in a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe that the improvement in injury statistics in the last season will continue.
“Sometimes, when you get back in line after an injury, you’re vulnerable for a while — during that time you need to regain strength and gain a competitive advantage,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to do it.
I hope he recovers physically, I’m sure of that, as well as that his career will be the one he deserves.
Arsenal starts their Champions League campaign on Wednesday with a match against Dinamo Zagreb and will continue it on Saturday with Chelsea and next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the squad.
Hector Beljerin and Aaron Ramsey did not come to Croatia, so most likely in the starting lineup will play Mathieu Debussy and Arteta.
Perhaps Wenger will also include Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep the balance and give a bit of a break to the players who need it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are the clear favourites in Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is among the most disappointing in Europe.
Dynamo have not lost any of the 41 matches since they managed to spend last season as the “Invincibles”.
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was hit by an earthquake of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal have learned the lesson they learned last season when the team was defeated in a Champions League game by Monaco, and remains with little hope of leading the club to victory in the Champions Cup final.
"It's an incredible drive," Wenger said.
Arsenal have never done this before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but on the other hand, I am a realist with experience.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons of male friendship
The lack of such stories is striking, especially considering how desperate men’s need for frankness has become, now more than ever, with the suicide rate among young men at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the single largest cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and men are three times more likely to die than women.
In an effort to understand the issue, the Campaign Against Unhappy Living declared 2015 the Year of Men, with the aim of challenging a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the center of this battle to take on this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression found that if a patient has a sufficiently large number of friends “in a normal mood,” the chances of a cure double.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends halves the chance of mental disorders.
But, of course, for friendship to work, first of all, it must be.
In an age where communication is driven by social media, where style is preferred to content, speed of response is often valued more than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to appear strong, fun-loving, and successful, even if the reality is loneliness.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a stronger impact on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire video game creator recently pointed out, money doesn’t really buy happiness anymore.
The advantage of Friends is that they attract attention to it.
Each of the characters was determined not by his work, but rather by the personality that manifested itself in communication with friends.
Joey’s humor and Chandler’s constant hugs, moments of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross sighing at Rachel – all come from understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As a Samaritans employee told me, “...my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal underscores how even the smallest communication between friends can be beneficial.”
Often, those men who turn to us feel unable to talk to friends.
The old teaching of “live with it” is strong, as is the feeling that talking openly about problems can be perceived as weakness.
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-running coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the subtle moments of male friendship.
As for my task, the status of an outsider talking on the phone helps people in moments of despair, while long-term support comes from the inner circle of family and friends.
So, if you’re visiting FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where the set has been completely restored for the holiday, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk.
Or better yet, if you see a single person at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
It is impossible to predict in advance what benefits friendship can bring.
Friends show on Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, under the tag #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored a goal, helping PSG to defeat Malm<0xC3><0xB6>
Angel di Maria, along with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani, celebrates the goals scored at the Malmo goal.
Angel di Maria, making his Champions League debut, scored a goal that allowed PSG to easily overtake Malm<0xC3><0xB6> on Tuesday.
Here's the report on the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel di Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a and Edinson Cavani did their job when Paris Saint-Germain started their Champions League game with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malm<0xC3><0xB6> at the Parc des Princes stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after his first Champions League game as a PSG player began to set the direction for the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Cavani scored a goal in the 61st minute.
Along with Real Madrid and the Donetsk Shakhtar in Group A, Paris had to take a good start in the game against the champions of Sweden, as they aimed not at qualifying for the playoffs, but to continue the series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they reached the quarterfinals.
They earned points, but at the same time it was not the best decision on the part of Laurent Blanc to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in the attack and later replace him on the field in a game against a team from his hometown and the club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so to win 2-0, to give the opponents problems and to play well in the defense is a good start, even if there are still moments that we will need to finalize during the season,” said Blanc.
That's promising.
We wanted to win and we did it, although I regret that we didn’t score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after an injury in one of the substitutes in the Paris team, which brought her a draw with a score of 2: 2 in the match with Bordeaux in the First League this weekend, but he was pushed to the background of Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine striker has been hailed as a player capable of taking PSG to a new level in Europe after being bought out of Manchester United last month, and he proved why when he ran a pass from Marco Verratti behind Malm<0xC3><0xB6>’s defense and beautifully completed the attack by sending the ball past Johan Willand’s goal in the far right.
However, if someone expected then from PSG easy and big victory, they had to be disappointed.
Malm<0xC3><0xB6>, which beat Celtic in the playoffs to get to this stage, having nine world-class players on the pitch at the start of the game, five defenders and two supporting midfielders in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But, with the exception of the blow of Nikola Djurgic, in which the ball flew past the long bar of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute, they attacked quite a bit.
But PSG at times failed itself with ineffectual transfers and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who only in the first half could not implement at least five attempts, and then could not handle the ball scored by Cavani immediately after the resumption of the game.
However, he proved to be much more skillful in precision passes, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, receiving which, Di Maria sent the ball with a twisted kick, which passed close to the bar past Wieland in 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth ball of the season after Ibrahimovic adjusted the ball sent to the center of the field from Maxwell's left flank.
This put an end to any ideas Malm<0xC3><0xB6> had about returning to the game, and only the close-range interception of the ball by Wieland did not allow David Louis to increase the final score before the substitute Essequiel Lavessie scored at the very end of the match.
Malmo coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, with the Norwegian saying: “Our last Champions League game took place in December last year.”
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, and this is not the level.
Qualifying is not enough.
Glory to "Money"!
It was a wonderful match with them.

White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The White House confirmed Tuesday in an official statement that Chinese President Xi Jinping will arrive on an official visit to the United States later this month.
The visit — Xi’s first visit to Washington — will take place on September 25 and will be a return visit to President Barack Obama’s visit to Beijing in November last year, the statement said.
US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, at a government dinner on the same day after the two leaders hold bilateral talks.
“The visit of President Xi Jinping will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on common, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, as well as allow the presidents of the United States and China to constructively address controversial topics,” the statement said.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle to meet with executives from several leading U.S. tech companies en route to Washington and then travel to New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to discuss a number of contentious issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyberespionage and China’s growing assertiveness over the disputed South China Sea.
The man who shot down the biker in Kutuzovsky received 2 years in the colony.
In addition, the court partially satisfied the civil claims of the victims to Denis Mirzoev in the amount of 1.2 million rubles.
The Dorogomilov court of Moscow sentenced Denis Mirzoev, who shot down the motorcyclist to death on Kutuzovsky Avenue in Moscow.
According to the “Russian news service”, Mirzoev received a sentence of two years in prison in the colony-settlement.
He was found guilty under the article "Violation of traffic rules and operation of vehicles" of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
In addition, the court partially satisfied the civil claims of the victims in the amount of 1.2 million rubles.
During the hearings of the parties, the prosecutor asked to sentence Mirzoyev to three years of imprisonment and to recover from him the claims of the victims in the full amount of eight million rubles.
The accident in question occurred on May 22 at about three in the morning in the area of the house 30 on Kutuzovsky Avenue.
The BMW car, which Mirzoev was driving, crossed the opposite lane and hit the rider standing on the side of the road.
From the injuries received, a man born in 1989 died on the spot.
Friends of the deceased in social networks reported that the driver of the BMW was driving at high speed and before the accident drove to the opposite lane.
Fearing that the driver will try to escape from responsibility, the bikers organized a motorcycle ride from the Sparrow Mountains to the building of the Moscow police department at 38 Petrovka.
Shortly after, it became known that the investigation following the interrogation detained the alleged perpetrator of the accident.
A naked man was arrested in Moscow.

More than 40 decrees and orders were signed by Vladimir Yakushev.
More than 40 resolutions and orders were signed by the Governor of the Tyumen region Vladimir Yakushev at a meeting of the Presidium of the regional government.
Some of them concerned the allocation of funds for educational and medical institutions in the municipalities of the region.
In particular, funds are allocated for the purchase of a bus for one of the schools of the Nizhnetavdinsky district, for the overhaul of the regional hospital in the Kazan district.
According to the accompanying documents, the money will be used to complete the overhaul of the second floor of the therapeutic department.
Repair of hot and cold water supply networks, water disposal, power grids and electrical equipment, ventilation systems will be carried out, the facade of the building will be put in order, the premises will be repaired, a set of measures for fire safety and energy saving will be carried out.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
On September 17-18, the second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi, in which the Tyumen delegation headed by the governor will take part.
The Honorary Consul General of the Republic of Belarus in Tyumen Vladimir Shuglya, who was part of the official delegation, tells about the upcoming event in Sochi and the interim results of cooperation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what tasks does the Sochi forum set?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is based on the fruitful cooperation of the regions - important links between the two states.
It is planned that Russian President Vladimir Putin and President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko will take part in the plenary session.
In the framework of plenary and sectional sessions, we will talk about the experience of regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, regulatory and legal support and programs of the Union State.
The governor of the Tyumen region will speak at the forum.
I think that this testifies to the successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of relevant ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also come to the forum.
There will be trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including those from the Tyumen region.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new profitable contracts and agreements.
I would like to add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk in June last year.
It was attended by more than two hundred delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia.
At the same time, a very important agreement on cooperation between the Tyumen and Minsk regions was signed.
The importance of our achievements is also evidenced by the fact that a meeting of the permanent seminar at the parliamentary assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus was held in Tyumen.
In addition, the delegation of the agro-industrial complex of the Tyumen region visited the Republic of Belarus in order to study the experience of Belarusians in training personnel for agriculture, identify additional points of contact and organize new investment projects in the field of agro-industrial complex.
You recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with the Governor of the Tyumen region Vladimir Yakushev, it was about the cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus in modern difficult conditions.
The issue of supplies of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms will be raised - they are needed to reduce the cost of machines for the end consumer.
The problems in the work of the Tyumen trading house "Belshina" and options for preventing losses were discussed.
Issues are important, as investment projects should work clearly and bring profit to the region.
They talked about further deliveries of passenger and cargo equipment of OJSC "MAZ", the development of the service center of OJSC "MAZ", which was created in Tyumen on the basis of OJSC "TPATP".
The conversation also touched upon the preparation of the visit of the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus before the end of this year.
Another topic of the conversation was the completion of the agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation between the Tyumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of relations promises to reach a new level.
These issues also concerned the regional center.
During the meeting with the head of the Tyumen city administration, Alexander Moore, we talked about updating the Tyumen bus fleet.
About 100 buses are already “breathing on incense”, so a new batch of cars from Belarus is needed, which will work on gas, environmentally friendly fuel.
Another aspect: the Tyumen elevator plant cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of elevator products of JSC "Mogilevliftmash", receiving components.
In my opinion, this activity could become more active, given the programs for the installation of new elevators in the regional center.
I will add that within the extended powers of the consul, a meeting was held with the Governor of the Kurgan region Alexei Kokorin, during which the issue of increasing trade turnover and the supply of modern Belarusian equipment in the Trans-Ural region was discussed.
A meeting with the Governor of Omsk is scheduled for the end of September.
The expanded consular district includes five constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called a kind of headquarters of the district.
The region is a testing ground for many promising projects, including the work of the honorary consul general.
In general, such meetings are significant and good because they allow you to directly and quickly solve many problems, removing their sharpness and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current conditions, it is extremely important not to destroy the reserve, continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon against focusing on the ethnic diversity of people engaged in film production
Matt Damon had an argument with African-American producer Effie Brown, saying behind the scenes that it was not necessary to take into account the ethnic composition.
During the Sunday airing of Project Greenlight on HBO, the famous actor interrupted Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative points of view on the main black heroine in the script chosen for the project.
“Diversity is appropriate when you’re casting for the film itself, not the show,” Damon insisted.
Frightened Brown, not believing her ears, insultedly shouted "Wow! Wow. Well, well" all the time, while the actor from the "Martian" gave comments live.
To discuss the finalists of the show, Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farelli brothers.
“I would like the participants – no matter who the director is – to think about what interpretation of the image of Harmony they are going to adhere to,” Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who is beaten by a white pimp.
The film's producer, Dear White People, advocated that the film be directed by Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon was strongly opposed, saying that "in the end, we may not get what we want."
After this discussion was shown on television, social media exploded with disapproving comments against Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni angrily commented on what was shown in the video: "Explaining the essence of diversity from Matt Damon to the only black person in the room is SO WHITE that it hurts."

Damon’s statements appear just when competent coverage of a racial topic in the media is the most pressing issue on the agenda of public discussion.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot dead by a police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained popularity across the country, calling on lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, the singer Prince mentioned this movement during the presentation of the contenders in the nomination "Album of the Year" at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
“Albums still matter,” he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
More recently, the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement issued an official statement in response to a question from Fox News employee Elizabeth Hasselbeck about whether this group would be considered a hate group.
“The Black Lives Matter network is a group of love,” the movement’s leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon is on the list of show business figures, producers and media tycoons invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation and whether he met with the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" awards the first champion
Professional climber and assistant waiter Isaac Caldiero on Monday night became the first winner of the show "American Ninja Warrior", taking home the prize of $ 1 million.
At this sports show, the 7th season of which has just ended, none of the participants has managed to go through all the stages of the track with obstacles.
In the season finale, two contestants, Caldiero and cameraman Jeff Britten, made it to the final round.
The final task involved climbing a 75-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to complete the task at the set time, becoming the first athlete in the history of American Ninja Warrior to go through the grueling stage 4, but Caldiero managed the task as much as three seconds faster, making him the winner.
After the victory, which came with incredible difficulty, Caldiero, who was shocked by the fact that he won a million dollars, gave an interview to E!News.
“It’s incredible to think about it, I’ve never earned or lived on more than $10,000 a year,” Isaac told E!.
And suddenly this... I never even imagined how it happens... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed met with The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the finale and why Britten, who was the first to go on the track, would not receive any cash prize.
According to the rules, the fastest participant gets the money.
“If there’s more than one player who finishes, the prize is the fastest,” said Weed.
Although money is a wonderful reward and life-changing, it still receives great satisfaction.
I don’t think he feels offended about that.
He's happy with what he's done.
He received tons of rave reviews from fans.
He is a wonderful man and family man.
He is a hero to his wife and children.
Jeff told me, "If I'm supposed to lose to someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we switched roles.
"America Ninja Warrior" will return for its eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tigers are quietly going around the Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS – The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers now take last place in the Central Division of the American League.
Claiming only to be a hindrance, the Tigers brilliantly won Tuesday at the Minnesota Twins with a score of 5-4 at Target Field.
"Twins" missed the chance to reduce the half-game gap from the "Houston Astros" and take second place in the playoffs in terms of the number of points after the winners.
For Detroiters, even for one night, it was a return to the F-word that eluded them for most of the second half of the season.
“All winnings are fun, no matter how they happen,” said Tigers manager Brad Osmus.
The Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon contributed to supporting the attacks, resulting in Detroit scoring three points in the first two innings, then adding another in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pitcher in 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
It was only his third quality start in nine exits.
“I just want to end the year with good numbers,” Simon said.
Pitchers can’t be replaced in every game, so I want to get deeper into the game.
The Tigers' designated rebounder Victor Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez managed to fight off three blows and scored two wounds - the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three strokes since four strokes in a game against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He did a good job with the bat," Osmus said.
He performed well in (better quality), was noticeably better in batting and retained that quality for the game.
Having scored three shots in the second half of the seventh inning, the Twins got their best chance to return to the game.
Central host Byron Buxton opened the inning with a double on the left line of the field.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks, having made a bow, took the first base, and the second baseman Brian Dozier received a strike-out from Simon, before his place was taken by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy overtook Moer, the only player on the way, ahead of newly appointed rebounder Miguel Sano, who knocked out a two-shot "single" to the left of right-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners out of the way and a comparative wound at second base, VerHagen managed to bring third baseman Trevor Pluff to a double-play.
It was the 27th time for a top-flight player this season when Pluff kicked the ball into double play.
After Detroit added collateral damage in the first half of the ninth inning, Moer earned an RBI "double" in the space between outfielders against the closing pitcher "Tigers" Bruce Rondon, and the score became 5-4.
However, the right-handed player knocked out Sano after three strikes and got his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of Phil Hughes, who was temporarily out of practice at the start of the game.
The Tigers scored three shots in the first two innings against the deserved pitcher, who was on the injured list until the game itself, missing for more than a month due to lower back inflammation.
“It’s definitely not the start I wanted,” Hughes said, “but as the game progressed I started to feel more comfortable and so I was able to do some pretty good shots in the third inning.”
After the first batter reached the first base, Hughes threw the single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
Wok at the two outs of Wrightfielder J.D. Martinez led Victor Martinez, who made the single in the middle for the first wound in the game.
Victor Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez finished his series "0 for 21" with the runners in the scoring position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos then made a "single", bringing another wound, but Victor Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez was knocked out in an attempt to approach the third base, thereby eliminating the threat.
The Tigers increased the score in the second inning, receiving a one-out "double" from catcher James McCann and a two-out "single" of central rebounder Anthony Goose, and that became 3-0.
“It was a powerful hit,” said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit particularly well, but he got right to the point.
Hughes, whose throws were considered, threw in the undefeated third inning, after which he was replaced by the right-handed reliver A. J. Achter.
Hughes counted three wounds for six hits and a wok with four strikeouts.
Comments: Pitcher-right "Tigers" Anibal Sanchez dropped out of the players due to the stretching of the right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed surgery on Sanchez’s shoulder back in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August, is scheduled to start on Wednesday.
In Sanchez’s absence, pitcher-leftist Daniel Norris will leave the injured list and go up against the Twins.
Norris, who has come out with the Tigers in four starts since his acquisition in exchange for pitcher-left David Price on July 30, has 1 win and 1 loss.
He hasn’t played since August 20 due to a stretch of the oblique muscle.
The Tigers and Twins will complete a series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will play pitcher-right Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original complaint of Kadyrov on the book "Prayer to God" was submitted to the South Sakhalin court.
The Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk city court received the original appeal of the representative of the President of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov on the decision on the recognition of the book “A plea to God: its meaning and place in Islam” as “extremist material”, reports “Interfax” with reference to the chairman of the city court Alexander Chukhray.
Now the court is waiting for possible objections of the participants in the process.
Chukhrai refused to comment on the statements of some deputies of the state Duma of the Russian Federation on the need to check the city court for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence services and ISIS.
"Let them comment on such nonsense themselves," he said.
On September 11, the South Sakhalin City Prosecutor’s Office filed an appeal against Judge Natalia Perchenko’s decision to recognize the book as “extremist material”.
The South Sakhalin prosecutor’s office filed an appeal on Friday evening.
There are nuances: the prosecutor’s office believes that they asked the court to recognize extremist only the opinion of the author of this book, and not the verses from the Koran.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the judge made the wrong decision,” Chukhrai said.
The decision to recognize the book as “extremist material” was made on August 12, 2015.
In particular, "extremist" were called quotes from the Qur'an - "We worship You and ask You for help", "So do not call on anyone besides Allah."
Kadyrov called the decision-makers on the book “shaitans and provocateurs”.
Deputies of the state Duma, he called for a legislative ban on judicial decisions concerning the texts of scriptures.
“I am firmly convinced that the State Duma should adopt a law, according to which it is forbidden to take judicial decisions directly related to the texts of the Quran and other Divine Scriptures,” Kadyrov wrote on his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments insulting migrants and refugees
Facebook employees intend to remove posts and comments that give a negative assessment of migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints about illegal content.
To combat the manifestations of xenophobia and racism in the network, the leadership of Facebook intends to work together with the Ministry of Justice of Germany.
So, on the eve of the head of the department Heiko Maas said that at present, the Ministry of Justice together with experts of the social network is engaged in the creation of a special group of moderators.
Its participants are obliged to monitor and remove comments that are incorrect in relation to migrants and refugees.
According to Heiko Maas, it is assumed that the authors of intolerant posts will receive notifications indicating the reason for deleting their record.
To facilitate the prompt blocking of illegal content should also organizations whose specialists are engaged in collecting complaints from users of the social network about offensive posts.
The management of Facebook intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative statements about migrants and refugees, the leadership of the social network and the Ministry of Justice of Germany was made after the German segment of Facebook sharply increased xenophobic sentiment.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented scale of the migration crisis that engulfed the EU countries some time ago.
Germany is already overcrowded with all the points intended for accommodating refugees.
On the eve of the authorities decided to temporarily settle migrants in the territory of the former concentration camp Buchenwald.
Forced migrants from the Middle East and Africa are placed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
In Moscow cemeteries there will be zones for relaxation.
In the near future, several of the capital's cemeteries will be equipped with specialized zones for relaxation and psychological rest.
Among the first will be Butovskoe, Domodedovo, and Shcherbinskoye cemetery.
The first zone for psychological recreation has already appeared at the Troekurovsky cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, similar sites will appear in other parts of the city.
About this portal m24.ru told Artem Ekimov, occupying the post of head of the State budget institution "Ritual".
The relaxation areas will be small green areas resembling parks.
According to experts, in such "corners" visitors of cemeteries will be able to relax, be alone with themselves and restore psychological strength.
In the near future, relaxation zones will be built in Domodedovo, Butovo and Shcherbinsk cemeteries, and then in other areas of the capital.
According to the head of the GBU "Ritual", if there is a need to expand the area of the cemetery, the builders will try to preserve the existing forest areas to the maximum possible extent.
Green plantations will serve as a living fence, which will separate the recreation areas and areas designated directly for burial sites.
Experts of GBU "Ritual" also announced their intention to make a proposal to abandon the fences at the graves.
New cemeteries can indeed become barrier-free.
In addition, the GBU "Ritual" told about the readiness to engage in the installation of electronic terminals, with the help of which visitors to cemeteries will be able to learn the GPS coordinates and license plates of burials.
In June of this year, Ritual also offered to adjust the cost of burial services depending on the time of year.
So, digging a grave in the summer will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, weeks in winter, when the ground is frozen.
It should be noted that over the past year, prices for all types of ritual services have risen by an average of 10 percent.
In the forests of Elnin five days later found a lost mushroom.
The elderly man was alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without food.
The Mushroom Mountain was discovered thanks to the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "79-year-old pensioner from the Tambov region spent five days in the forest."
Without food and water.
He was sought by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even cynologists with dogs, but there was no result.
It was possible to find the man after the helicopter connected to the search work.
That day, Vitaly Alexandrovich, as usual, went to the forest for opiates and podberezovikovs, but did not return by the evening.
Relatives immediately asked for help, and the next day on the search for the mushroom were raised rescuers and caring residents from the neighboring village - only about 30 people.
On the fifth day, a helicopter of the fire and rescue center joined them.
Andrei Seletkov, head of the search and rescue team of the fire and rescue unit of the Smolensk region, said: "The helicopter was attracted, the man was found."
He went far, far away, in a different place.
It was about 12 km from the search site.
He walked a great distance at his age.
Miraculously, he survived.
Hrybnik was taken to the Yeltsin central district hospital unconscious, in an extremely serious condition.
Doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and hypothermia of the body.
How an elderly man was able to stay alive after five days in the forest, doctors do not imagine.
Valentina Nepsha, head of the therapeutic department of the Yeltsin CRB: "Appointed examination to the patient, treatment."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Considering all his chronic illnesses.
The patient's condition improved in the morning, remains severe, but with positive dynamics.
Pensioner Vitaly Alexandrovich every year comes to Smolensk region from the Tambov region.
His grandson says that his grandfather used to go to collect mushrooms, but he never went far into the forest.
Alexey Spitchenko, grandson of the found mushroom picker, shared: "The forest is not far from the road, he is not local in principle."
He literally came to visit relatives for several years.
Well, go get the mushrooms.
Apparently, he went too far and got lost.
With the beginning of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all parts of the Smolensk region.
In the last few days alone, there have been five similar cases.
Rescuers remind: in the forest you need to go in bright clothes, with a small supply of food, matches and a compass.
In addition, it is desirable to leave traces behind, so that later you can go back.
Emergency An-2 sat on the average in the fraternal taiga.
Right on the average sat in Siberia emergency An-2.
An emergency landing of the aircraft of the Krasnoyarsk airline "Yenisei" made 68 kilometers from Bratsk.
No one was killed or injured, but the plane itself sustained significant damage on landing.
An-2 made a service flight.
On board were three crew members - the commander, the co-pilot and a flight mechanic, Interfax reports.
The emergency aircraft made a flight on the route Zheleznogorsk-Ilimsky - Achinsk, where the airline is based.
The crew of the plane has already been delivered to Bratsk.
The Bratsk transport prosecutor’s office after the crash landing of An-2 began checking compliance with the legislation on flight safety.
The investigation team of the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor’s Office went to the scene.
In September 2010, the crew of the Tu-154 landed its aircraft with passengers due to a technical malfunction at an abandoned taiga airfield in Komi.
Engines and onboard electronics failed on the liner, but the crew did the impossible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board.
No one was injured during the emergency landing of the plane.
Economics <0xE2><0x80><0x95> Nobel Laureate: Globalization
The processes of globalization were supposed to contribute to the reduction of inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation is different, the difference in incomes of the population in developing economies, on the contrary, is growing.
Eric Maskin.
To correct this, it is necessary to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers, said the chief researcher of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Solutions of the HSE, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2007, Eric Maskin.
In the last twenty years, the world has experienced an unprecedented growth of global markets.
The trade borders between the countries became more and more open.
Proponents of globalization predicted great benefits for emerging economies.
"And these predictions have largely come true," Maskin said.
For example, China and India have experienced strong per capita GDP growth.
However, not everything is so rosy.
Globalization was expected to reduce the gap between the “haves” and the “have-nots” in poor countries, which is manifested in large income inequality, or rather, wages.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, says Eric Maskin in his article “Why Global Markets Haven’t Reduced Inequality in Emerging Economies,” published in The World Bank Economic Review, which was translated and quoted by HSE.
Together with Harvard University economist Michael Kremer, Eric Maskin has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the income gap in poor countries is widening as globalization grows.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
To demonstrate them, Muskin allocates four levels of qualification of specialists - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, D specialists from poor countries lack the skill level to cooperate with A and B specialists from rich countries.
And if workers at level C from poor countries increase wages thanks to cooperation with employees B from the rich, then D workers do not feel the growth or their wages fall at all.
The net effect is that the internationalization of production will increase the wage gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and, accordingly, increase inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskin proposed a surprisingly beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage.
It allows us to explain why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fuad Aleskerov, full professor, head of the International Laboratory of Analysis and Choice of Solutions, head of the Department of Mathematics at HSE.
And like any powerful theory, I am sure it will lead to a surge of empirical work in this field.
The solution to the problem, according to Eric Maskin, is to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the workers themselves, as the scientist notes, do not have the funds for this, and it is unprofitable for companies to pay for their training.
In such a situation, governments, international agencies, NGOs and private foundations can play a significant role, Maskin believes.
The scientist notes that the developed theory in no way calls for a halt to the process of globalization, which has brought and is bearing fruit in the form of GDP growth of countries.
Derbent: The Living Connection of Time.
Derbent, one of the oldest cities in Russia, celebrates its 2000th anniversary in September.
The program of festive events includes a festival of national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and a fair in the style of past times, an exhibition of derbent carpets and the Day of Open Temples, a historical and musical show "2000 years in two hours" and excursions to the reconstructed museum of Peter I.
The medieval stones of the Naryn-Kala fortress, ancient Arabic inscriptions on the walls, narrow streets and palace gardens - all this seems to have come down from the pages of "A Thousand and One Nights".
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has been preserved in its place since ancient times.
Although it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Khazar Khaganate and the Golden Horde.
The age of the eastern plane trees, which grow in the courtyard of the derbent Juma mosque, is equal to several centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russian program "Trees - monuments of wildlife".
The shadow of spreading crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
Visitors to the mosque will be served with fragrant tea and Dagestan delicacies - honey figs, persimmon, musmula, miracle cakes, ayran and sweets.
For centuries, large samovars have been used in Derbent to make numerous guests drink tea at once.
The inscription above the entrance to the Juma Mosque says that the building was built in 115 AH.
That is, in 733 according to the Gregorian calendar.
It is the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is striking in scope and solemnity: arcades of domes and vaults rest on square columns and are illuminated by the rays of the sun from tiny windows.
The content and breeding of pigeons is a traditional hobby of the residents of Derbent.
Owners of poultry put pigeons in the yards, under the trees, in the attics.
An exciting sight is the ascent into the sky of a flock of white pigeons, similar to flashes of festive fireworks.
In order to defend against the enemy, the ancient Persians blocked the Caspian gate with a double stone wall.
Going 500 meters into the sea, this structure locked the harbor of Derbent.
In 2003, the fortress walls of Derbent were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best-preserved monument of ancient Persian fortification architecture.
Carpets in Derbent were woven in the 5th century, and to this day the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged.
In one of the streets adjacent to the city market, carpets for every taste are sold - strips of wool, cotton or felt of all colors and shades, with and without pile, with complex ornaments and bizarre border.
The construction of the city began with magals - neighborhoods with one-story stone buildings.
Over the years, the maggots have hardly changed.
Only satellite dishes, air conditioners on the walls and street lights remind you that you are not in a medieval, but in a modern city.
In the old part of the city, the details of the water pipeline, built by the Persians about a thousand years ago, have been preserved.
To this day, there are ancient sources in which the locals still draw water.
Many derbents prefer ordinary tap water from proven historical fountains.
In Derbent was one of the centers of pottery.
Irrigation and painted vases, dishes, jugs, cups were valued throughout the Caucasus.
The hands of potters and now make wonderful ceramic products for both practical and souvenir purposes.
On the days of holidays and festivals, crowds of spectators gather under a tight rope, which is performed by students of the Republican School of Circus Art.
The history of amazing and risky craftsmanship goes back several centuries.
A new trend - among the rope walkers more and more often you can see girls.
In the premises of the former Maiden Bath today operates the museum "Culture and life of the Ancient Derbent".
Previously, unmarried girls and brides were washed here, accompanied by friends, and now anyone can see the vaulted-dome hall, hot and cold pools, bath accessories that have passed into the past.
Most Derbent homes have hot water, but baths and steam rooms are as popular today as they were in the old days.
About the benefits of warming the body by steam is written in ancient books.
After the bath, blood improves, the muscles lose fatigue, the body acquires flexibility and lightness.
The festival "Commonwealth", which takes place on the territory of the Naryn-Kala fortress, is attended by ethnic courtyards of many districts of Dagestan.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk melodies, sing songs of the peoples of the Caucasus and treat visitors with delicious homemade cheese.
Kirkhlyar is the burial place of forty martyrs who laid their heads for Islam.
This is one of the most revered complexes for Muslims of the North Caucasus.
The yellowed sarcophagi are carved out of solid stone blocks and oriented, as is customary among Arabs, along the west-east axis.
Brothers Gabriel and Albert Yakubov cut and shave customers in a small salon near the Upper Bazaar.
The barbershop has been in this place for many years.
Hairdressing techniques are passed down from generation to generation.
At the same time, the Yakubov brothers can make not only traditional, but also the most modern hairstyle.
On one of the streets of the Old Town, a house was preserved in which the writer-decembrist Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinsky, exiled to the Caucasus, lived.
Having learned the Turkic language and collected ethnographic material, he described Derbent in the first third of the 19th century with its ancient monuments, life and everyday life of citizens.
Tchaikhana is a traditional club of the East, where only tea and homemade pastries are served.
Men come here to quench their thirst, talk to friends and solve some work problems.
As in the past, it is not recommended for women to cross the chaihana threshold.
Derbent dance ensemble "Caspian" was created three years ago, but has already managed to take part in events of the republican and Russian level.
The soloists of the ensemble rehearse every day, perfecting the folk Avar, Dargin, Tat, Armenian dances.
In the evening, when the noise subsides and street lights are lit, locals sit on benches near houses with protruding terraces.
As a rule, derbenttsy discuss household issues.
But on the eve of the anniversary, they are increasingly recalling episodes of the unique history of their city, which influenced the fate of the entire Black Sea-Caspian region.
In Domodedovo, a business "game to the airport" was held.
A new form of education is being tested in the capital.
Four hundred students tried themselves as airport employees.
To do this, Domodedovo assembled models of three aircraft harbors.
The young people not only inspected and registered the passengers, but also served the aircraft.
All this is in the form of a business game, but in complexity it was not inferior to reality.
Delayed flights, two passengers with fractures on board, the ladder was lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
For a real airport, hell.
For the one who settled in the Domodedovo hangar - a standard set of tasks to be solved by beginners.
In one hangar three large airports from different countries of the world fit at once.
Today, they employ four hundred students from metropolitan colleges and universities.
An unprecedented chance to learn all about the inner world of the airport.
Registration of passengers, aircraft maintenance, baggage turnover - they were entrusted even with buses on the flight field, ladders and searches of passengers.
Passengers are problematic.
One had a document mess, the other was late for his flight, and the third had filled his bag with suspicious items.
And to deal with all this, as in life - in the minimum time.
For each of these completed tasks, they are charged a certain amount, virtual money, as if the airline paid them the corresponding amounts for flight maintenance.
"For failure to fulfill the relevant tasks, they are fined," financial analyst Dmitry Hilko explains in an interview with the Vesti-Moscow program.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely monitoring what is happening.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try a new form of learning.
She has already found a place in the course of secondary vocational education.
“Six interregional competence centers will be formed, which will, in fact, become new models of the activities of modern colleges with a modern management system, with highly qualified staff, with modern equipment,” Natalia Zolotareva, Director of the Department of State Policy in the Field of Training of Workers and Additional Professional Education of the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia, said.
But students are not on the global agenda.
After three days of such training, they seem to need a day off.
But the grades for this exam were quite material.
The newest smart glasses, the best I've ever seen!
"I received them for having responded to the claim to our airport on Instagram in a timely manner," said Sergey Shuvalov, a member of the game and PR manager of the Frankfurt Airport team.
The best judges, as they say, were taken on a pencil to invite them to work by the time they finished their studies.
The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia expressed regret over the closure of the American Center for Foreign Literature operating at the Library.
The center has been operating in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the American Center of the U.S. Embassy at the All-Russian State Library named after M.I.Rudomino in Moscow.
“The unilateral steps taken by Russia recently cast doubt on the Russian government’s commitment to the ties between the Russian and American peoples, which have not been broken even during the Cold War and other difficult moments in the long history of relations between our countries,” U.S. Ambassador John Tefft said in a statement.
The American Center created deep and lasting ties between the people and culture of Russia and the United States.
It was a center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a meeting place for numerous American dignitaries, including cosmonauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
“Just last year, the American Center held more than 400 cultural and educational events and received more than 50,000 Russian visitors,” the diplomat said.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago, it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - the FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program) educational exchange program.
The Green Tribunal was quick to execute.
A typical situation: four officials stand before Judge Svatanter Kumar’s desk, listening to his claims to the work done.
The court is not satisfied with the quality of your work.
“We didn’t give you a 110-page order to make fun of it,” Kumar said.
If one more brick is laid, we will order the demolition of all existing buildings.
Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NZT), a judicial body established in 2010 to stop the rapid pollution that has accompanied the rapid economic growth of recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal has dealt with more than 10,000 claims related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two out of three cases, the court decides to stop construction leading to pollution.
The stakes are unbelievably high: In less than 60 years since India’s declaration of independence, India has grown from a virgin jungle to one of the world’s most overpopulated and polluted countries.
The problem is particularly acute in large cities, where infrastructure development is not keeping pace with rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from enterprises and households, and the few remaining residential areas are being cut down for construction with new residential quarters.
Despite the formal support of the green movement by the state, the NZT is regularly criticized by the government of Narendra Modi, as it often becomes the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
In May, the environment minister called the court’s rulings “extreme” and “unenforceable.”
Sometimes the court’s decisions are really impossible to comply with within the deadline set by the court, confirms environmental lawyer Raj Panjwani.
However, impracticable deadlines also have a positive side: at least they make the responsible persons move.
“His main goal is to shake up this system,” the lawyer adds.
The Green Tribunal has repeatedly cancelled major construction projects, including the closure of an airport, a power plant and hundreds of smaller structures.
At the same time, people are also trying not to forget: for example, during the discussion of the fate of a pharmaceutical company in Telagnan state, which polluted the local river with fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
“People will lose their jobs,” Kumar said.
However, such explanations are not always understood by ordinary people, whose lives can be changed thanks to a single stroke of the judge's pen.
Thus, in April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles older than 10 years from entering the capital, which caused public outrage.
Despite a sharp decline in popularity and a flurry of criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to cancel this decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics on incoming and outgoing vehicles from the Delhi government, and made an offer to purchase 10,000 additional buses, having previously learned from the factories whether they were able to fulfill such an order.
As pollution sources such as landfills, fuel quality and even road accidents began to come to the attention of ships, people’s anger began to subside.
But the most painful topic of the principled judge was the Ganges River Cleanup Program, announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges, a sacred river for the Hindus, the judge often stops restraining his emotions and proceeds to scream.
Do you know what the word “holy” means?
Someone poured water from the Ganges on the statue of God, and there were feces in it, - the judge is hot.
You keep polluting the river because you think: Gang is Gang, he will take away all our sins.
This is the river that we worship, and look at what you do with it every day.
The Ganges Cleanup is the most ambitious and costly environmental project announced by the new government.

Xi Jinping calls for an economy that is more open to the world
The economy must become more open to the world to spur its growth, President Xi Jinping said Tuesday in an address to a group facing the task of guiding reforms.
“China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and develop an open policy,” he said, addressing participants in the 16th meeting of the Central Leading Group Committee on Comprehensive Deepening Reforms.
According to him, expanding openness and deepening reforms will give the economy a new impetus and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The lead group adopted a number of directives, including the introduction of investor access regulations, changes to border control rules, the promotion of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that attract private capital, and the revision of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually debugged through trial programs.
This is an important step as it will give the market a more meaningful role in allocating resources, ensuring the rule of law in the business sphere and increasing openness, the statement said.
The government will also loosen control over the powers it grants to companies, ensuring that companies run their own businesses.
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to develop new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to enhance local growth.
Even more areas will be available to private investors in order to increase the openness of government-controlled sectors of the economy.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better conditions,” the statement said.
The procedure for applying for a permanent residence permit for foreigners, or “green card”, will be further facilitated by streamlining the requirements and simplifying the application process itself.
The meeting also discussed the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report issued after the meeting, it was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli.
