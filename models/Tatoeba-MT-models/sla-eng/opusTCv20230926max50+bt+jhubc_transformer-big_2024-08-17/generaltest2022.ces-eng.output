A great return of the Czech badger is coming.
Paul French has been drafted into the NHL.
Czech hockey goalkeeper Pavel French, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 31-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the bench and could soon get into the goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litv<0xC3><0xAD>nov, Plze<0xC5><0x88> or Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
He took turns in the middle of the game against Vegas, and has not appeared on the NHL ice rinks since.
The incident occurred at the moment when an experienced goalkeeper moved from one pole to another.
"Paul French will be out for about three to four weeks with a lower body injury," the Denver-based group said in a statement.
His return to the NHL goal was eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning, he was called from a farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he accounted for 94.5% of the interventions.
The Plze<0xC5><0x88> hockey player wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
In his senior year, he had hip problems and did not catch a single match in the shortened pandemic year.
In the NHL "Franc<0xC3><0xAD>k" caught 36 matches, his success rate is at 92.3%.
Charles on Christmas card puts Camille's face on, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain’s Prince William and his wife Kate have chosen a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as their Christmas wish this year.
Prince Charles also made his wishes public, using a photograph in which he helps his wife Camille wear a mask on the racetracks.
This was reported on the BBC’s website.
They send their wishes to friends, co-workers, and foundations they work with.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki color, and Princess Charlotte also has a dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, wears, like Princes George and Louis, shorts and a shirt with a collar.
Who took the photo, William and Kate did not specify, it is not clear exactly when it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed for a Christmas card photo on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood at their rural residence in Norfolk County.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also published by the heir to the throne Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them in June at the races in Ascot.
Charles, who has a hat on his head and a mask on his face, helps Camille to put on her mask in color matching the light dress.
Slavia, according to efotbal.cz, promised Berber a million for the title, Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k denied it.
Prague – Criminals in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr should have promised from Prague Slavia a million crowns for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
He informed the server efotbal.cz that he got to part of the police files.
Jaroslav Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Vr<0xC5><0xA1>ovice club, said that they did not commit any corruption in the red and white.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavia figures mainly its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended up at the championship club last summer.
According to the file, the former influential red-and-white official was in frequent contact with both Berber and the former sports director of the then second-tier Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the defendants in the case.
Criminals allegedly worked with information that Slavia promised Berbr a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, SK Slavia Praha won the first league title.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) should receive a million-dollar bribe from SK Slavia Prague officials for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to the criminologists, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of Slavia Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k.
According to the server, the file no longer indicates whether the police are still dealing with this information.
He rejected any form of corruption.
In the years 2015-2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We have never committed illegal conduct, we have not sought to influence arbitrators in violation of the rules of fair play, and we have not provided any financial performance in this regard to anyone," Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k told Seznam Zprávy.
In the wiretap, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some former Slavia players of dark skin and also slanders his former boss Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k.
The case of allegedly influencing matches through referees was opened in mid-October last year by a police intervention in several places, including the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R headquarters in Prague.
The highest-ranking player in the affair is Berbr, who no longer figures in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, Rogoz, like the former sports director of Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad, was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are the larping of the cold war.
Guns will be new, but in principle of the worse type (gunners must be out of the armored cabin and wear hubcaps manually without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, moreover, we have already managed to get rid of Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat- decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we do not have at all (but we produce and balance abroad)
Air defense: medium - cold war, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have such a story.
I have a chase right next to the city.
Nutria were coming out of the river and doing damage to crops, so I sat there.
When I arrived, I saw a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I had hoped he would leave before something came out, but of course the fox was gone in a moment.
I let her come within 40 yards of me before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost shit his pants, waved his head in all directions, so I called him to tell him it was for the fox.
By the time I got off the property, he was gone.
I mean, even a meadow can be a Prussiar.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you'd probably be seen in the thermovision that almost everyone has today.
So in a visible place, expensive things put your feet in a spacak and you should be fine.
It's a joke versus a hammock.
The interior got respirators much cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of face masks, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The iRozglas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that in one day the amounts per respirator differed by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities have behaved economically?
And why did others buy railways?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to iRozglas editor Dominika Kubi<0xC5><0xA1>tová.
I appreciate the soldiers and the army (I guess I am not affected by the memories of <0xC4><0x8C>SLA that have passed through the older generations), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory war.
We do not even have large warehouses of equipment that could be trained, we do not actually have modern technology for existing professionals, moreover, modern technology is becoming increasingly complex, so the skills of reservists will rapidly lose in time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to re-train someone.
Finally, reservists/territorial defense are of great importance for countries such as Ukraine, where mass guerrillas are going to lead, and it is also a pronounced necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic there will be a struggle only in a conflict of such scale and intensity, where the guerrillas will already be irrelevant, and we do not even have a suitable geography for this.
We don’t have an individual skill.
That's not the worst part.
The worst part is that half of them are playing like they have it.
Then there are situations when you see a guy who missed an empty gate two minutes ago, rushes into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss and you say to yourself, "tvl and what do you think is going to happen now?".
Of course, they will take him as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill of "watering the defender" is so terrible that I caught myself that I am honestly surprised to see that our attacker was able to beat one player of the opponent.
The first swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts are not expecting any major reversals in the coming weeks.
The pressure in hospitals, according to statistical models, will continue for some time, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently dominant Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, how much vaccination or post-infection immunity obtained by a previous course of the disease helps against it.
But this week, an unexpected plus-side phenomenon has also entered the covid equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug has arrived in the Czech Republic, the antiviral molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which from the results so far reports a success rate of as much as 85 percent.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how the local administration is prepared for incoming medicines.
As it was said, the first to reach domestic patients will be Merck's molnupiravir.
The company ended up on the tape first also because the drug began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find a suitable treatment for equine viral disease on the South American continent.
With this research, it is often overlooked that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
Eastern Europeans, and we Czechs in particular, are used to saying "how our beak has grown".
See, you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you no.
In the West, they will tell you how much they love migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist bastards.
And then they go and vote parties like the AfD.
He's afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means job loss and media lynching.
Then it looks nice in surveys, west good, east bad.
But he'll find out what people really think.
In France alone, Le Pen and Zemmour are both over 20%.
We even know that the objects in Czech are three and completely identical.
Identical due to the rotation of the units, so that the soldiers do not have to re-learn where everything is, so all objects are the same.
One of them is the Atom Museum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its territory either because of safety or the speed of deploying the warheads because of the more western location.
In these underground shelters (there are two in each maple) only the heads were kept, not the whole rockets as they say.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this warhead and mounted it on a carrier device.
In addition to the museum maple, the rest are in a desolation state.
In the second grade of elementary school we had a classmate Gypsy, we were with him for 4 years.
He was quite cool, he made good jokes, he often showed himself too much, but he was our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he often went and wanted to explain something, he missed a little, he went regularly, he played sports with us, he did not steal snacks or phones, he went dressed purely.
He also went to schools in nature, did various ape shops, but he was fine, maybe never any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies, entered the same grade, another class.
In short, they beat the teacher, the police often solved something there, threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something on the ad (old things, something I do not need, etc.) and I have often sold to Gypsies, they always had money, they did not try to stretch me on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold the car like this, the guy called a month later that he had already overwritten it on himself.
I say myself that I am not a racist, I don’t care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave as they should in a decent society (work, work, women don’t fight, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes in, stretches out his hand, houses and flats, he's got nothing but clutter, he's making trouble, so it doesn't matter what color he's got, but I'll be okay with it.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they get involved, start a business, work, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will be theirs.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachatice
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot," said Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokeswoman for South Bohemian paramedics.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was driving the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle probably drove in the direction from the village of <0xC5><0xBD><0xC3><0xAD>chov to the village of Bavorov and, for reasons not yet determined, drove in a turn in the opposite direction.
After a collision with the <0xC5><0xA0>KODA OCTAVIA, a Peugeot vehicle ended up on the roof off the road, South Bohemian police spokeswoman <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánka Schwarzová described the accident.
The young driver of the Peugeot suffered a very serious injury in the accident.
There were multiple injuries and he was wedged in the car.
After his release, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and in a stable condition he was airlifted to the hospital in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, stated the paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the second car suffered a minor chest injury and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from non-EU countries, customers often do not provide data about them
Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys collectible cards.
"Usually, it can be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars higher, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where mail is often free," the collector said.
Since October, ordering small consignments has become slightly more expensive for him, he must now add VAT and hand over the data to the customs procedure to the post office.
He receives an e-mail saying that the customs officers are expecting the arrival of the package.
Then it is enough to fill in the details of the shipment, and if the VAT was not already included by the trader at the time of sale, the customs office will measure it from the total amount for the shipment and for transport.
In the event that the addressee does not arrange the customs procedure himself, the carrier’s remuneration must also be added to the total amount.
According to Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two checkboxes, insert two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it’s usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
However, not all shipments are delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of received shipments from abroad fell from 60 thousand to 15 thousand at the international post office in Prague.
In addition, according to the Czech Post, the problem is that people do not respond to calls for data that are needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 shipments in the international mail that we have to process.
If people filled in all the data they needed and filled them in on time, we would be about halfway there, Czech Post spokesman Matyá<0xC5><0xA1> Vit<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
The solution to inflation
See the headline, how would you propose to address current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and are expected to continue to rise.
What should the state do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
In Poland, for example, we see a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen that's inevitable with where it's headed?
Prices are rising faster than wages, and I think it’s inevitable that people won’t be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (who is an employee)?
This year I was added 2% in gross, which is a mockery, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business that I run at work.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why convicted rapists are sent to prison for as little as six months?
I just can't get my head around how a court can send an animal like that to jail for six months just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, it will negatively affect her sexual relationships and relationships in general.
Not to mention the fact that the rape victim may never recover from it either.
Wouldn't that discourage a potential future report of rape?
The man from the grave “burned” his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from the Grave inadvertently helped the officers secure his state-wide wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, who had been ordered to be arrested.
He called them to himself.
But he did it in a roundabout way.
First, he approached the passer-by and made up a story that he had been robbed.
After calling the emergency line, the officers arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged “thief” told them that he had made up everything so that the officers would arrive at the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to advise the officers on how to file a report with the Police of the Czech Republic.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers found that the woman was on the wanted list, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant was issued for her.
The case is therefore handled by the PCR.
An honest question for the people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
Personally, I am of the opinion that we are no longer ethnically or culturally Slavs, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with the meme, it is a pity that Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague in the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
I don’t know, it’s quite a question whether a rational person can really believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
Personally, I would not consider such a case to be true faith.
I can’t agree with Pascal here, there are an estimated 10,000 different religions in the world, if I’m not mistaken.
Which god or gods should a person choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in one of the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
But even in the Ten Commandments it says that there is no god but Yahweh.
Would it not be more rational, then, to refrain from believing in any god than to risk picking the wrong one out of the thousands of gods, and the one true god I just missed will send me to hell or some such place?
Other: Voluntary training followed by inclusion in reserves.
The Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months for one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
All the ACR files could use something like this.
This could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can say the following: There is a constant talk of cooperation between the education sector and industry, companies are hunting in schools and there is a kind of intertwining, when the labor force migrates from educational institutions to employment relations.
Not only in adolescence, but this process takes place constantly, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
A similar interplay should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build some kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that a Russian, a German or a Mongol invader will never come here again.
I find it funny that you think NATO is something carved in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if there is a problem.
Well, please.
All it takes is one election in the U.S. to skew their budget and the whole of NATO goes to shit.
The British will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that they can show their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that has long been functioning as a guarantor of independence is the armed army and the population that can control the military equipment of their time.
And today, any teenager can pilot a remote-controlled device, so whatever.
We don't need a border wall, that sucks today, but the gritty teenager behind the remote-controlled device's knuckle can handle it.
How Not to Drown in a Boxed Tsunami
Do you unpack presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you are at home covered with boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is again used by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
This creates a map of the shops that will welcome your used boxes.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a pity to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the involved store (the map of the KAMsNIM.cz project contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The stores themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently lacking on the market, as well as the money saved, as the packaging carton has become more expensive by 50% in the recent period.
In the eyes of environmentally-minded customers, this also strengthens my brand.
One of such stores is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-drugs and eco-cosmetics.
Boxes and filling material are transported to Pop<0xC5><0xAF>vky u Brna by individuals who accumulate at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular collection of discarded cardboards.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, together we create a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for the next generations, says Petra Lopu<0xC5><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xAD>ková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only pick-up points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand over expired medicines, tires, used electricity, batteries, light sources, large-volume waste, etc.).
All garbage can end up in the right place, plus reusable items will find a second home.
In total, the map of the project already contains over 100,000 such places.
“Gradually, there are collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help to find use for things that would otherwise become unnecessary waste,” adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the association Ukli<0xC4><0x8F>me <0xC4><0x8C>esko.
Rather, I feel bad that nowadays the technique is so simple and stupid that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there was a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of components on the computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple applications on photos or actually mobile phones in general simply hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throw everything on one screen in the application.
Let them use technology from childhood, but above all, let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU Presidency before the weekend – starting in January – and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency’s logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many actions that they could not be done in six months.
French politicians love it, and so do the voters.
Macron’s supporters of the right-left divide agree on little, but they do in Europe.
In France, there will be a new presidential election in April.
The electoral calendar has also influenced the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write “a history of Europe”, and France is ready to create conditions for such a work of historians.
Many commentators immediately rushed to criticize Macron for pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, it is rather trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for President of France, <0xC3><0x89>ric Zemmour, is now circling France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is quite successful among the French.
Let’s try to take Macron’s idea of a history textbook seriously and not look at what’s happening in France.
Wouldn't that be necessary?
Students in European countries are often taught history as a story we versus they and never as a story as a whole.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs find out who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they do not have an enlightened cantor, they will no longer know what the broader context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
Czech "Mouses" did not win.
The story, which returns to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, also received awards for directing and for best actress Jasna Duri<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he held the first place in the audience ranking.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu/being sick" A few days I had diarrhea and didn't want to smoke...
It was worse than the common flu.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Personal experience only. I’m not saying that everyone has it)

Trains begin to run according to the new timetable, carriers will change somewhere
From Sunday, trains begin to run on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on some lines, for example between <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n, where RegioJet starts to operate instead of Czech Railways.
On most lines, only the departure time is adjusted, or their route is slightly adjusted.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The sale of tickets began in the autumn.
In the new timetable, Czech Railways plans to operate an average of 6,783 passenger services per day, of which an average of 478 long-distance trains per day.
The trains will run approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections, the new timetable will also include routes to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Together with the new timetable, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be dispatched by the carrier to North Moravia or West Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares by an average of 3.2 percent from next year.
Tracks take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the timetable of RegioJet is the entry to line R23 <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem – M<0xC4><0x9B>ln<0xC3><0xAD>k – Nymburk – Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n.
After the success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport, the carrier will be replaced by <0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 routes per day, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v Brod, <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ár nad Sázavou and Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n stations from Sunday.
Leo Express has retained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedla<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, despite the planned shutdown work, the carrier also tried to maintain the most similar driving times of its long-distance trains.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue.
The carrier will also be replaced on some regional routes.
Passengers are waiting for changes, for example, in <0xC4><0x8C>eskolipsko, where on the route from Mladá Boleslav through <0xC4><0x8C>eská L<0xC3><0xAD>pa to Rumburk, the trains of the German company Die L<0xC3><0xA4>nderbahn will run instead of the Czech Railways.
In the second year, passengers will also be able to use uniform fares on the railway.
As with the Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Don't we learn the other side's perspective?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work, they died.
I have never heard a teaching in my life from the point of view of the slave party or from that time, no one defends this, only condemns.
No one will ever tell you in school that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves, and that they were often the worst slavers.
No one at school will teach you that the colonists often bought land from the Indians, but everywhere they will tell you how brutally we Europeans murdered them, killing each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly in schools, both in the northern schools and in the southern ones.
I have not met with anyone deliberately concealing the facts, but I have heard before that this is happening and I think it is a problem, I do not deny it (for example, in Japan atrocities from WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's point of view, without understanding.
History is not interested in one’s feelings, it is simply what it is, and I think it is a fatal mistake to condemn it without looking at the things of that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never do that again.
By the way, since we are in those southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slavers there are quite popular, on the other hand, they also had some good successes, and I thought it absurd to reject them.
In addition, the North was not much better, as many people today idealize it.
And a lot of people forget that not everyone in the South was a slave, and a lot of things were against them, too.
I would not compare this with the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, moreover, maybe our view does not exist in them (there was also a video on YT from television, where they turned off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What struck me as ridiculous in U.S. schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I thought it was terrible at some universities, the students were quite radicalized and the schools supported them on many occasions.
And if I imagine that these people will one day be much older, then I'm a little sick of the fact that this could be the voice of the majority, because it is among the young and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that maybe feminism has already achieved what it had a long time ago and it is no longer about the same thing, it has become radicalized.
Currently, feminists are those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT, and this leads to radicalization on the other hand, when it often leads to resistance even in quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they can be heard.
In any case, I have also not met with anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
I had a bad experience, but it was mutual. :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do myself?
In addition, the concept of nationality in general I consider unnecessary from the point of view of some personal identity.
If something connects me to people so interests, views of the world and common experiences, not the place where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a very nice guy, he preaches more about theology than politics, but then he always fucks up some cock about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed of.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
They are officially Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholic modernity and are de facto Catholic without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but go to Hussite services because it's theologically very similar, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michael in the Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even every Sunday at 15:00 they make a mass in Latin, as it was done before Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
B<0xC5><0x99>eclav – The flame lit in Bethlehem, where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts did not go to Vienna for him because of the coronavirus pandemic, but in the morning they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal-B<0xC5><0x99>eclav border crossing.
They took it at the border last year.
Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which we participate in with the squad every year, I look forward to it very much.
It is an honor for me to be chosen, Amálie Bud<0xC3><0xAD>ková, a Girl Scout, told the journalists present.
While last year the transfer took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly at the border bridge, now at the Reintal-B<0xC5><0x99>eclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, however, scouts take the train to Vienna for him.
Nothing changes in the delivery of the flame in the Czech Republic.
With the light of Bethlehem, the scouts traditionally set off by train first to Brno, where they handed it over to the diocesan bishop Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cikrlem.
On Saturday, December 18, scout couriers will take care of the subsequent delivery of light, who will travel by selected express trains and personal trains.
From them, local scouts or volunteers will take the light in the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame throughout the Czech Republic and where the railways do not lead.
This year too, scouts must comply with the current measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
It's going on just like last year.
We give recommendations to both courier teams and organizers of local events, of course, to wear masks, try to keep the intervals, there were as few of them as possible, not to sing colleagues, just to behave in such a way as to be as safe as possible, described the spokesperson of the Bethlehem Light event Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the light of Bethlehem, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread simultaneously with the flame the idea of peace, friendship and peace.
The light of Bethlehem is for the believer a symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, it has been spread by scouts and scouts for more than 30 years.
The event is attended by hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health care and education will make proper use of this money, but I do not understand why this money is given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - an unnecessary product is produced and it disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I myself work in a factory where in the corridors a million signs are "xy funded/co-funded by project xy" and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This is not a support for a company that gives jobs to x people, this is a slowdown in development when this company is holding on and taking orders/employees away from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise.
Totally agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the Internet age, too, gets caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I think that internet ads will not move me, but then I catch myself that they also influenced me - it's just so tricky that you can't always avoid it.
That is why I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who currently want to ban programmatic (= targeted) advertising completely...
It's all crap, in the words of the classics - I would ban the Internet.
I have a feeling that this source has roots in (but mostly in point 1):
“I won’t believe something that most people believe and it makes sense, I’m not a sheep, but I’d rather believe something that’s less likely, it doesn’t make much sense, but it’s important that I have an original opinion of my own that I’ll say is critical thinking.”
“I don’t believe everything the media says.”
“I don’t trust politicians.”
Television has fallen on the trend of Christmas movies, the premiere of which this year have two hundred
Los Angeles – Cinemas, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have succumbed to the trend of Christmas movies, and this year they will present a record-breaking more than two hundred of them to their viewers in the premiere.
It was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDb.
In recent years, the genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring and significantly increasing the audience, which is why more and more films are being created.
This year, there were four times as many Christmas movies as in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database included only those images that have the word Christmas in their name, so there will actually be many more holiday films.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are especially associated with this period, and the films Home Alone, Love in Heaven or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular worldwide.
However, the real boom in Christmas pictures began only in 2009, when the American cable television station Hallmark came out with a special film series, BBC reported.
Her Advent project, called Countdown to Christmas, included four films and was a huge success.
This year, this station began to tune its viewers for Christmas on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
Competition station Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on the program this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix are also contributing to the total.
“In this magical period, the story doesn’t matter that much, the important thing is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and it’s snowing,” Brandon Gray, author of the Christmas movie book I’ll Be Home for Christmas Movies, said in a statement.
“For the audience, it’s a form of escape and a way to feel at least two hours of peace in the midst of all the holiday madness and madness of the world we’ve been living in for the last few years,” Gray said.
According to him, for example, TV Hallmark still uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there is about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding, which is solved successfully and the two kiss.
It’s like this over and over again, and as long as all the movies look alike and have a similar atmosphere, people are watching one after the other.
Mazepin tested positive for COVID-19 and will not be involved in the final race of F1.
Only 19 drivers will enter the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin has tested positive for COVID-19 and won’t make it to the final race of the season.
Haas will only send one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack a better position from the 20th place, which he drove in qualifying.
Russian Nikita Mazepin of the Haas Stadium, however, ultimately does not interfere in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It has been tested positive for COVID-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the grid, with Mazepin’s teammate Mick Schumacher going from the last run to the first Max Verstappen to face Lewis Hamilton in a direct title battle.
According to Haas, Mazepin is relatively normal and shows no symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all parties involved," its representatives told Formula1.com.
He will not send a replacement rider to the Haas race, nor can he.
Any substitute would have to qualify or drive in another part of the weekend.
COVID-19 does not affect the first driver.
At the start of the season, Kimi R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen had COVID-19, last year Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive.
You could get arrested for that, too.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze!
It is a bit like a portable jewelry store and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but with little experience, at home, sweaters have never worn much,” admits Lebanon, who spent over 3,000 hours over the course of half a year on his work.
Silk bought in Italy, 24-carat gold threads in France and 2000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
The silver stars were then decorated with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but silk gives the sweater softness," praises the creator of his work, which, of course, does not recommend washing.
And it's got one more catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as soon as possible," admits Lebanon.
If it succeeds, it will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater to date, sold five years ago, cost “only” 720,000 crowns.

The government has approved the deployment of up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Engineers, scouts and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help their Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially asked for help from NATO states in connection with the months-long actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with a false promise of easily crossing the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already operating on Polish territory.

Hygiene's looking into another case of Adam's baby.
“Currently, we have reported further suspicions of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from primary school Adamov is not proven," Ciupek said.
There were six cases in the county this week.
“We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague,” the director said.
She added that these are two nurses from one department of the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, as well as two 11-year-old pupils of the Adamov Elementary School.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
Three of them, according to the director, have mild symptoms, four are symptom-free.
No one with a suspicion of Omicron traveled abroad
None of them have traveled abroad, nor have any of their families come into contact with anyone who has stayed abroad.
The connection with the championship in the water polo is not in any of the above, said Ciupek.

California will restrict the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas in banning abortions.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to ban the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the nation’s most populous state through a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial anti-abortion law following the detection of an embryo’s heartbeat.
People would then be entitled to compensation in the lawsuit of anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and home-made firearms in California.
Newsom’s announcement came in response to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling Friday that upheld the Texas ban on abortions, though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent that established abortion rights across the U.S. by roughly the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court did not now decide on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on the technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
The enforcement of the prohibition was in this case transferred to the public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it in the ordinary course of justice.
“I am outraged by yesterday’s ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, which allowed Texas to maintain its ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas’ maneuver to protect its law,” he said.
“If states can now block review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use that power to protect human lives,” Newsom continues.
He instructed his subordinates, in cooperation with the state parliament and the Minister of Justice, to work on a measure that would authorize representatives of the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
These are home-made weapons that do not have serial numbers and that can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants “private citizens” to have the right to claim at least $10,000 in damages and court costs from anyone who would manufacture, distribute or sell assault rifles, ghost guns, or sets for their production in California.
“If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create a threat to private prosecutions, then that’s exactly what we should do,” he said.
California has banned the production and sale of certain military-style weapons for decades, but a federal judge blocked the ban in June as unconstitutional.
If the state actually reinstates the ban using the Texas template, the words of the liberal member of the Supreme Court Sonia Sotomayor, who in a dissenting opinion on Friday’s majority verdict warned against extending the legal mechanism to other US states, would be confirmed.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant the Texas ban full immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to pursue lawsuits against selected officials of the southern U.S. state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, where one gradually comes up with what the vaccination scheme will look like and also improves the vaccines themselves, based on the results.
For example, a large-scale study on the effects of 4 doses is already underway from Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients have up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which has already had the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule after a while, but it is too early for that yet.
Another fact is that soon a new vaccine based on an inactivated virus should come to the market, which, according to the manufacturer’s specifications, promises up to 10 times more effectiveness.

Poland Threatens to Halt Payments to EU Budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would act against the law if it used the new powers and stopped the payment of money to Poland due to a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of Poland's plan to draw <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36 billion from the EU's recovery fund for the economies hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to go ahead and use a mechanism that allows EU subsidies to be taken away from countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose a narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justified given that the EU unlawfully deprives us of funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes a more radical stance in its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish justice system has undergone under Ziobro threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobra, Brussels is creating “impossible conditions because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland”.
Warsaw faces “a political dictatorship carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles,” Ziobro said.
He said that Poland should be a member of such an EU, which is based on the partnership of sovereign states, and not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions to Brussels, as a result of which the sovereignty of Poland would be limited.
“We will never agree that Poland should have the status of a colony,” he said.
But let's face it... in Lidl, we have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I did not look for other things, I met one yogurt more times, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, that's right, in that narrow sector there were all the selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If there is an evasion, I will not go to any market anymore, no action, a gold store in the square, they may not have such a choice, but they usually have everything I need and it has some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a vacation.
And I don't care anymore.
For two years, I've been watching how the data here is treated like manure, and most vaccine opponents are just a little bit more out of the box than most vaccine advocates.

Ew, I'm relieved.
I'm sorry for the outburst and wish you all a nice day.
I was punished with a boil when I was a kid.
It was never about grades, it was mostly about me repeatedly refusing to listen and being angry (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always threatened that if I did it again, I would get a blow (sometimes even after the next "crushing" she just brought and laid it down so that I could see it).
It wasn’t until I repeatedly refused to listen that I was hit in the ass (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in reasonable execution and measure) are beneficial, because the child reacts to them much more than to words.
The important part, I think, is the warning part, because it gives the child a choice, in its own way, whether to disobey and get it, or whether to improve and not to be punished.
In the end, all I needed was a warning to start listening.
Defense of the system
When a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge, Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl, answered a journalist’s question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution means to him – whether the sacred charter he swears to and has been learning about since he was a child at school, or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he definitely adhered to the first concept.
Once in the Constitution, we agreed on democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and with changes it is better to save.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as the Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl asked at the time.
Recently, however, there has been an increasing opinion among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes.
For years it has been tested by situations that its creators (to which Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl belonged) could not have foreseen, for example with the behavior of a directly elected president.
In one thing, however, Cepl was right.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be considered.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to mastering most of the crises that societies have encountered throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of order of government consisting of individual rules that set the game’s limits for politicians.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so politicians are bound by prohibitions.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
COVID does not choose, they are fighting for the life of a several-month-old baby in Brno University Hospital
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder to children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with mainly recently.
“We know that children are at risk and less affected than adults, there is talk of 2 to 5 percent compared to adults,” Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the Brno University Hospital and the Faculty of Medicine at Masaryk University, told Novinky.
The course is much easier, lighter, often occurs without symptoms.
But there are children who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we have seen especially in the recent period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It takes place in the clinic of children's infectious diseases.
Indeed, very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently on the ARU.
Children with post-covid syndromes were in the ward according to the doctor continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, that is, pneumonia, which requires a stay on a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease affects both adolescents and several months of babies in addition to adults.
There are also children in serious condition in hospitals due to the coronavirus.
“At present, we have a child of several months and adolescence,” the mayor said.
However, he is pleased that no child deaths have been recorded at the Children’s Hospital of Brno yet.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominik, in the children’s hospital – not only in the coronavirus department – it is an integral part of the psychologist’s cooperation.
At the same time, it draws attention to the fact that, as in adults, so in children, vaccination alleviates the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
"That's why we recommend the administration of the vaccine dose to children," the doctor added.
In the quiet zone, you can walk only on the marked paths.
But the quiet zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
In general, in national parks outside the rest zone, you can walk anywhere (but do not climb over the fence to the field).
Skiing/biking in the forest outside the marked roads is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not very guarded outside the national parks).

China is building the impression of a managed contagion and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better
Sinolog Jirou<0xC5><0xA1>: China is building the impression of a managed contagion and that the authoritarian regime is better able to face the crisis.
China has embarked on a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing reflected criticism for failing to stop a disease that has turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports a zero increase in the number of infected.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are helping in many ways to fight the coronavirus, including in the worst-hit Italy.
How do you feel about Beijing?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says, “Hey, don’t you want an elephant?”
I have it and it's great.
The wife likes it because she saves the grass, washes the car with the trunk, the children play with it.
Well, that's great.
If you want $5,000, I'll sell you the elephant.
Let's go for it, it'll be great...
After a while, they meet and the guy who bought it complains: “Dude, what did you sell for an elephant?”
The lawn's torn up, there's huge shit everywhere, the car's all messed up, the kids are scared of it, and the wife wants a divorce.
The guy who sold it says, "You don't talk good about an elephant, you don't sell an elephant like that."
World affairs are controlled by the powers that be.
Although the equality of sovereign states is valid, they are the powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a power if it works towards its integration.
It still operates at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but there is still a lack of military integration.
Personally, I think that Europe is moving towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century the mood will be different and it will be successful.
I thought of that too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'll just say a few words.
I'm just assuming that the ellipse usually includes 2 different units at the same level.
Let me take an example from another comment on "Spanish oranges and tangerines", when it is clear that they are both from Spain, while "Spanish fruit and tangerines" is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
Moreover, I base this on the fact that the phrase is "all American forces" including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in this broad term and there is no need to specify it further in the case of American forces.
But again, maybe I'll just say it :D
Either way, it's a pointless request.

The terrifying footage shows the moment the frightened monkey crouched in the toilet bowl before its heartless owner flushed it down and laughed at her.
Holland's monkey also fed sausages, kebabs, and burgers, regardless of her actual nutritional needs.
The Gwent Magistrates’ Court has now banned her from raising animals for life, The Sun reported.
Monkey rehabilitation experts, who care for Milly after her abuse, said they had never seen such a terrified alien before.
Milly has spent nearly two years rehabilitating Monkey World workers in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The four-time mother has pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At the Gwent Magistrates' Court, she was sentenced to 12 weeks' imprisonment, with a suspended sentence of one year.
Hollande was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a lifetime ban on animal husbandry and has to pay 12,000 crowns in court costs.
The head of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: “Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue.”
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She crouched and hid from everyone she met, and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, when she has settled down and is satisfied with the male, the sight of new people can still cause panic in her.
The psychological scars from the abuse will accompany her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly’s abuse came to light after police in Gwent discovered horrifying footage of her phone after a robbery at her apartment over drug charges.
You can hear Milly swearing vulgarly in the footage.
The next video shows Holland offering cocaine to a monkey and saying, “Do you want cocaine?”
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox, 43, pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with the intent to sell it.
In her house was found cocaine for 1600 pounds (in the conversion of less than 50 thousand crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what wonderful concepts will you learn from that prehistory three times in a row when you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like when you're freshman year, you're gonna take the same stuff you took in sixth grade?
And it's all killed by the idea of bifling, where no one, honor the exceptions, cares if you can or understand.
Just write a test for 1 and then nobody cares anymore.
Go and randomly ask people on the street if you can determine the character of the roots of the quadratic equation and the coefficients.
They've all been through it, and the absolute majority won't even cross it off and tell you they're totally fucked.
So what the fuck is he learning?
I am a big fan of the general overview and the fact is that people do not want and do not need.
And in that moment, it's useless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
Part of it is learning for the many people who will need the thing.
But like, the note that you don't really need all this to stand at the machine, I meant it really seriously because you just don't need it.
In addition, we are slowly getting to the time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(Which is probably what our communist past and the persecution of the educated and the elites are also involved in) But the price of having barbarians stand by our machines is simply high.
If journalists could count, COVID would probably never have reached these dimensions.
Wedding at a glance: The war of Kadri and Andrey continues!
Which is the main reason why she can’t leave Switzerland right away,” Andrea said on Instagram in Stories, responding to the curious fans’ questions about what disappointed her so much about Kadri that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social networks.
It's been squeaking between Kadri and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move to her, at least until he returned to Bohemia permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! he was angry with Kadri's turn in response to Andrea's accusations of lying, gambling, and debt.
The alleged honesty of Kadri's now ex-wife didn't like his younger sister Linda either.
She decided to publicly stand up for her brother.
Normally, I don’t express myself at all about such things, and even in our family we never said such things much.
I certainly don't want to cause any regret.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and smear the name of someone I love so much, they just won't let me!
I am sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making a character out of himself and helping our family when we needed it most, despite how young he was.
All the more so when I have to read such false information, which is probably quite taken out of context.
I would like everyone to know Kadri as well as I, our loved ones and family, stand in the faith in response to Andrea's words.
I am truly grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and know the reality and know how it really was, she added vaguely.
A drunken thief climbed up the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Chao began his robbery in a parking lot in a residential neighborhood, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole less than CZK 330 from one vehicle.
Then he thought of nothing better than to climb up to the 5th floor and enter the apartment through an open window.
There he stole two bananas.
A security camera shot of him walking down the street away from the crime scene while eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were, and called the police.
She subsequently arrested Chao.
The man admitted to having drunk some alcohol on the incriminated day.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob in his drunkenness.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbs to the fifth floor, where he steals two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and effectively bound to pandemic emergency.
If it is repealed, the law will not be effective.
The law limits the scope of business.
Isn't that reason enough for you?
The right to collect will be limited, but not abolished.
More than 60 percent of voters came to the parliaments of four municipalities for Saturday’s elections
On Saturday, people voted in the municipalities of Kom<0xC5><0x88>a in Uhersk<0xC3><0xBD> Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>, Lu<0xC5><0xBE>ice in Mostecko, Nová Ves in Liberec and Rovná in Pelh<0xC5><0x99>imovsk.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has decreased under the law or the elected councils have disintegrated.
A total of 99 candidates applied for 28 seats on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday’s elections symbolically concludes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
There were four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, very closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said Eva Krumpová, Vice-President of the <0xC4><0x8C>S<0xC3><0x9A>.
She recalled that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding on equipment and personnel security.
On Saturday, the Association of Independent Candidates won 27.76 percent of the vote and two seats in the seven-member parliament.
The STAN candidate received 24.84% of the vote, which also means winning two seats.
Citizens for Kom<0xC5><0x88>a also won two seats in the parliament, with 18.52 percent of voters voting for them.
Jana K<0xC5><0x99>i<0xC5><0xBE>ková, the current mayor of the municipality, who is a member of the Privateers, also joined the council again.
One mandate in the parliament was achieved by the Kom<0xC5><0x88>ans – independent candidates.
75.48% of eligible voters came to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in the Pelh<0xC5><0x99>imov region, the association Pro Rovno won.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four seats out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 got to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62%.
Repeated elections in Lusatia in Mostecko were again won by the Association of Lusatia and Svin<0xC4><0x8D>ice led by Mayor Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich John.
It won 56.73 percent of the vote and, as in 2018, has four seats in the seven-member parliament.
The second place went to the candidate Municipal for the People, which was voted by 43.27 percent of voters, so it will have three representatives in the parliament.
76.7 percent of voters came to the polls.
The elections in Nová Ves in Liberec were won by independent candidates of Hope for Nova Ves before the YES Movement.
59.88 percent of voters voted for the association of independent candidates and won four seats in the seven-member municipal assembly.
YES received 40.12 percent of the vote and strengthened against the regular elections in 2018, won more seats and has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
On Monday, the results of the election will be discussed by the State Election Commission.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all the things that people write to you.
You're just playing dumb so you have someone to "fight" with.
If not, it is sad.
I'm not saying Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal to make them look good).
I don’t care who believes in what.
On the other hand, I don’t care how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it accumulated, suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she's caused, like that 30-year-old
Tl;dr: believe in a spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell head down from ten feet.
The impact on the concrete survived.
An incredible fall survived on Sunday night a man in Ostrava, who was intervened by rescuers of the Regional Medical Rescue Service.
The regional operations centre took over an hour after midnight on Saturday an emergency call with initial information about the fall of a man from a height.
Two ZZS crews immediately left for the scene – medical and medical.
Upon arrival at the scene, the paramedics found that a 27-year-old man had fallen from a window about 20 feet [12 m] high and hit his head on concrete!
Coal caught in the V<0xC3><0xAD>tkovice.
But not as it should be, and firefighters went into action.
At the time of arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The attending physician intubated his airways, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and after further measures within the pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to the further care of the Ostrava trauma center, said Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Humpl, spokesman for the ZZS Ministry of Health of the Region.
I am more concerned about the inadequate reactions of the public and the authorities than I am about the coronavirus.
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and medical staff are at the forefront of the fight against the disease.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We're asking military doctor David Rezac.

The legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of interesting results.
There was a lot going on in UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Pe<0xC5><0x88>ová managed to defeat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who has not found a slayer for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in the light weight, showed great strangulation against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
The victory was also won by Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept Cody Garbrandt away with a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also beat his opponent.
A surprise no one expected.
This brought a women's match bantamweight between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianne Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a.
The American entered the battle as an imaginary "dwarf", Nunes did not lose for seven years and grind her teeth for the next triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was carried in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the path to victory very actively and even gave the opponent a push kick, which she sent her to the ground.
Pe<0xC3><0xB1>ová, however, did not allow herself to be forced to make any further mistakes and tried unsuccessfully to attack herself with a lever on her hand.
The second round was exciting and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both rivals enjoyed a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
Pine got Nunes on the ground, where she started strangling her.
He had to give up and attack.
The American woman prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first, Poirier was doing better, but the card gradually began to turn.
In the latter he tried to be more active Oliveira, who tried to beat the opponent with a lever on the hand.
He didn't do that very well, but then he put a lot of pressure on himself, got his opponent on his back, and hit him with a series of wounds.
He won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to knock off the throttle.
The Brazilian defended the title, while Poirier lost two years later.
In the next match, he claimed a sovereign triumph Sean O'Malley, who already in the first round put a hard right back on Raulian Paiva.
He then took it with a series of precision strikes and scored his 15th triumph.
Kara-France was then able to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now after seven years, she lost.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, this is not complicated.
Most of the nouns in the Czech language express only one grammatical gender, so it is not difficult to determine whether this is a male, female or middle gender.
Then there is also a fairly large group of nouns for which the genus is not stable.
Such nouns vary between the two genera.
When tilting, they then acquire double tips and in some cases remain in an unbending form.
For example, the words "trouble" or "hip" are masculine and feminine, in the first they are inclined according to the pattern of "machinery", in the second according to the pattern of "song".
For another group of nouns, there are different shapes already in the first occurrence of a single number, for example: "row/row", "kedluben/kedlubna" or "potato/potato" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are written, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may differ regionally, for example "cucumber" in Bohemia and "cucumber" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is unscriptural, similarly there are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "trough" and "trough", "dough" and "doughnut" etc.
Some words that penetrated into the Czech language from other languages were initially reluctant, but gradually take over the Czech endings.
A typical example is the term "image", which is masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which remained in the middle line adamant, but in the male it has endings following the pattern of "castle".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation on the Greek border?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border over the growing number of migrants trying to reach Europe.
Thousands of people have moved to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped blocking them.
European politicians promise support to Greece, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What motivates refugees to take an uncertain path?
What does the situation look like on the ground?
For three months we didn’t see the blue sky and we were suffocating, says Sydney journalist
The devastating fires that Australia has been grappling with for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and residents coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison’s government have done more to prevent the drastic effects, critics say?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to Sydney journalist Ika Detrichová.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It is uncomfortable for people to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to prohibit it.
I don’t know anyone who has been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I have experienced how they are often treated by their surroundings or even the police.
Victims should always be trusted.
The trend is that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
But too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all the victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a big part of the accusation is made up" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping sexual abusers.
The Czech Republic is flooded with houses under construction, families do not have money to complete
Construction material prices have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
Many people have found themselves in a difficult situation because of this.
She does not have the funds to complete her family houses and the banks refuse to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to the price of the material, the price of construction work is also increasing.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to complete the already built family houses.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
At best, people move to undeveloped and undeveloped houses.
In the worst case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages and rents," says BHS economist <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pán K<0xC5><0x99>e<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
We will build two or three family houses in a year, and at fifty percent it happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult in that we have to keep some things contractually, even if the material has become more expensive.
So we do without earnings," said the owner of the construction company Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Slivo<0xC5><0x88>.
A lot of people are going to have financial problems.
If they were counting on building the house for five million, now it's going to cost seven.
I think some of them will wait," Sliven added.
From the material, copper, iron, as well as plumbing and heating equipment are the most expensive.
Construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
In the Czech Republic, graduates of construction disciplines are missing and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by the pandemic.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issuance of a building permit is more favorable.
"Building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," K<0xC5><0x99>e<0xC4><0x8D>ek said.
We're doing well, and we're going to get better.
But real visions are missing, says CRO commentator – mujRozglas
In addition to traditional celebrations, the New Year has traditionally been accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, in addition to Prime Minister and Chairman of the ANO Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> and the Christmas message of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman, the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also spoke to the nation.
What did we learn?
As in this, my diploma will be great right now, I have my own topic that I chose, I follow up on my bachelor’s, I always work on it all year round and then in a week or two I will write a written part.
The state authorities are quite calm in our country, if a person is not a total macaque and something is left in his head, then the commission will not unnecessarily suffocate him on the theory.
For example, I studied at the State University for a week, and when I was at the end, the Commission always tried to lead me to some logical derivation, which I immediately came up with and I was right.
Other than those projects, I know people who will pay someone to do the semester project for them (we have done it many times, really beneficial, they will learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they are old-fashioned.
In my opinion, it is great when at the end of the course there is an exam in which the knowledge gained within the project is reflected, not just a defense.
All right, but don't clutter up your e-mails and phones, and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be just as much a dick as they are.
The people at the embassy don't have anything to do with this.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can build a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Pooh Bear.
You might want to put it on Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta throws sticks at artists.
As soon as you don’t give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will be reduced to a bare minimum.
In addition, it still changes what kind of function is more important, whether like, comment or save.
It's been pissing me off lately, so maybe I'll have to get down to tiktok, where a lot of artists in my industry are successful and won't let it happen.
In the end, I might even be happy if something comes that is more user-friendly and doesn’t suck all the creativity and energy out of the artists.
Statement of the Party of Workers of Donbass
The union – yes, the breakup – no, the opponents of the breakup of the USSR express their opinion on the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in human history took place.
In the Bia<0xC5><0x82>owie<0xC5><0xBC>a Forest on December 8, 1991 Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal powers and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open leniency of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that "the Union of the ex-Soviet Union as an international subject"
With one stroke of a pen, they “abolished” a vast country of nearly three hundred million people.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Despite the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed what had been built in the previous seventy years in one session in the Bia<0xC5><0x82>owie<0xC5><0xBC>a Forest betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately carried out de-industrialization, curbed agriculture, severed from the world’s greatest power the fourteen republics that had previously been economically united in a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the impoverishment of the population, the disintegration of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the collapse of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the Arab Spring.
There is such a thing in political science as a “vacuum of power”.
Everything that was hastily betrayed and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by the NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken mainly because of the events of the late eighties and early nineties of the last century.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it by putting it in the fridge and making it into dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, in which I don’t buy the meat on Monday, the chain will reduce it to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday – describe to me the mechanism by which this meat will become a burden for my digestive system by changing its price?
Or do I wait until Thursday and the meat will be reduced to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the date of consumption - how would this meat be different from what I bought on Monday by 120 CZK per gallon and left it in my refrigerator for 3 days?
I'll answer for myself - nothing.
This shit about when something is cheap, it must be guaranteed to be bad, spoiled or of poor quality is terribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Now recently I went to Brno to Hlavas and in the subway the girls handed out some brochure, I always take similar things to help the brigade members, they can not throw it out...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but nowhere anything about God, I was confused, but I suspected that it would be some kind of agitation.
After reading it, I found out who published it and eventually Scientology came out of it.
Well, like it was good stuff, full of completely useless lessons, like I'm supposed to wash up and not be a dick.
It's a waste of paper, that's why the forests wouldn't have to be cut down.
I had a similar experience with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with that person because you love him without realizing how much the situation is in the [bleep] part.
She threatened to hurt me several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment early, she started crying and on her knees begged me not to go anywhere.
Then she began to physically block the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another six months passed, and she started to get whacked.
Then I ended the relationship by telling her I was breaking up and lying to her, but we can talk about it again next week to calm her down and not catch any amok again.
Such a person will suck feelings, emotions and overall joy out of you.
You better keep your distance
When the insurance companies are furiously stealing by buying a cloud of tests and chasing the positives, who wouldn't even know about this terrible disease if it wasn't for the test.
The only thing we are achieving is complications for companies, carriers and others, due to the fact that their employees in the random number generator fell five days of house arrest.
In the West, they had already given up on the ridiculous, and recognized that there was no point in dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and he has to steal something else and drive his ego by inventing faggots.
I see the good old bastard coming back.
After several years of suppression and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruiting is back in the spotlight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, freshman at university), the initial promises about training products and business skills quickly turned into "you don't have to care, just get people".
I was sincerely interested in the products that I offer, because I wanted to help people, but the trainings were more about how to scare a person and talk.
When the first money earned came, one quickly realized that if one wanted to make money, one had to pick up a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, so one felt like a door-to-door seller of pots.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, one has learned not to jump on every speck and thoroughly check the information.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw them all in one bag.
People in this business are successful and even beneficial to people, but they certainly will not boast of expensive consumer goods or a "fat" account.
I haven't seen a lot of that in the corporation where I work.
HR is calm, managers are watching their management and they don’t push us too hard.
Regular evaluation is somehow happening, in the form in which it is taking place in our country it is quite possible (set some goals for the next year, in a year we will see what has worked out and what has not) - it is more of a self-assessment than if someone would evaluate you by some numbers, and the like.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we are also a little unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes one feels that we are such a near-startup that squats in the offices of a large corporation.
But it works so don't bother us so much as long as there are results.
The Czech missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, British police searched unsuccessfully for the missing 32-year-old Czech woman, who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday, 12 December, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social networks that a woman from Uhersk<0xC3><0xBD> Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> had been found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed this afternoon to our representative office in London that they have found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not provide further information on the case.
My sincere condolences, said on Twitter Kulhánek.
The young woman was last seen on November 28 on the bus on the way from work, before she was supposed to pick up money from an ATM.
Her disappearance was reported by her colleagues five days later.
Police in London have been searching for her, and Interpol has listed her as a missing person around the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police arrested a man in this regard a few days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case and what he suspects, but did not disclose.
At the end of the year, four municipalities were granted new representative offices.
On Saturday, 11 December, new councils were elected in the municipalities of Kom<0xC5><0x88>a in Uherskohradi<0xC5><0xA1>t'sko, Lu<0xC5><0xBE>ice in Mostecko, Nová Ves in Liberecko and Rovná in Pelh<0xC5><0x99>imovsko.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has decreased under the law or the elected councils have disintegrated.
There were 99 valid candidates for 28 seats in the new elections.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the municipality of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men were elected.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate documents were registered for the new elections to the councils in the four municipalities.
Thirty-six women and 63 men applied for 28 seats.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest was 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday’s elections symbolically concludes a rather challenging but successful year for us.
There were four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, very closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
Most of the time we had to work in more difficult epidemic conditions, which put greater demands on equipment and personnel security, said Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last constituency was processed on Sunday, December 12, at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the voting will be discussed by the State Election Commission and, after approval, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the pandemic.
Dealing with the fact that we have a rather dangerous infectious disease at the very beginning took me a while, but it was possible without much hassle.
To cope with how idiotically a large part of the population in all its layers is taking this approach, I have a problem with it so far.
I look forward to getting vaccinated (tomorrow!) because thanks to it, I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not assholes.
He would be stripped of his presidency and his ability to re-acquire it.
The chances of this happening are very small, as others have pointed out.
Moreover, I am not sure that the mapping of the file could be considered treason at all.
High treason is an act by which the President of the Republic endangers the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who are without sex all year round is growing
More and more young adults in the U.S. are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious people, according to the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under the age of 35 who give up sex increased from eight percent to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 who say they haven’t had sex in the past year are more likely than ever to have had sex.
Other factors contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) has shown.
One of them may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher unemployment rate.
The presence of media, social networks or video games, which make sex less and less a priority for young people, could also contribute.
“Since 2010, there has been a rapid increase in the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who report not having had sex in the previous year,” Lyman Stone, an IFS researcher, said in a statement.
For married people, sexual activity is more common, with only 5% of them reporting having had no sex in the past year in 2021.
For single people, the figure was 29%, and Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious affiliation also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
Although spouses are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married people under the age of 35 continues to decline.
Young people share the opinion about premarital sex, about 30% consider it a bad thing, while about 70% think it is okay.
“It’s true that there’s a minority of single people in this age group, but their behavior is driving this trend,” Stone says of the 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, the abstinence rate for single people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month has increased from 20 percent to nearly 60 percent.
Among the “less religious,” the trend has risen from 10 percent to 20 percent,” Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and, above all, social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the probability of sex is lower in people without a job or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus “replace” this need.
This trend was mainly caught by the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole mandate of COVID-19 vaccination is about whether society should force a part of the population to behave in ways that they don’t want, but that can save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question on which I personally am most interested in the question of social conscience.
For example, the question is, if we don’t order them to do so and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly blame the death of an 80-year-old man who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it to him very well, heard some misinformation, and as a result, he didn't get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we are responsible for the death of a hardened opponent of vaccination, who shouts something about bullying and totalitarian state alongside the SPD and the Communist Party.
From the statistics I have mentioned, it is quite clear that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the latter group, so they will really be able to do it themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter sign up for a drought fight?
This year’s winter in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times.
Operators of ski resorts can not do without technical snow, the weather complicates even the preparation of cross-country skiing Jizera fifty.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will a little snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have a story, but it's not about a gentleman.
Once in high school, a teacher led us across town to a shipyard so we could take a boat ride on the river.
On the way there, we were walking along one such wide street, and we don't see anyone in the middle - adherents of the Hare K<0xE1><0xB9><0x9B><0xE1><0xB9><0xA3><0xE1><0xB9><0x87>a sect.
Of course they've fallen for us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but a friend and I had a conversation.
When she left, we asked her and her teacher what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
“I told them I didn’t have a soul,” she said.
Everyone, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We're so spoiled.
It’s not that much, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovic
The new German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where he was greeted with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the talks.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
According to the Chancellor, the crisis caused by the worrying movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian borders should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the “Normandy group”, bringing together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he briefed the chancellor on the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially triggered the migration crisis and uses people as living targets and weapons, as we record hundreds of attempts to (illegally) cross the border every night.
He and the chancellor discussed further sanctions so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin can finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU’s eastern border.
Scholz, according to the DPA, assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in its dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhuman treatment of the Lukashenko regime with refugees.
Drunk Polish nun blamed for accident, tried to cover it up
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but the car was driven by another nun, who was trying to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driving license for not giving priority to driving and driving away from the scene of the accident, she went out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun had run into the vehicle and asked for help.
Then the police came for Sister Celestina.
She was subjected to a breath test and, after discovering that she had over two-millimeters in her blood, her driver's license was immediately taken away.
At the same time, she was informed that she would testify in court about her actions.
Hugo the dog is doing what he can.
Juraj <0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D>, however, did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have looked up in American stories about dog pets.
But they forgot the essential thing: the laws of filmmaking.
After the kitschy film F. Brabce Gump - a dog that taught people to live, now another film is missing about the audience's emotions in the cinemas.
Co-author of the script and one-man director Juraj <0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D> Jr. loosely follows up on his previous film Here I Watch from 2012.
The talking dachshund Hugo and some familiar characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava boarding house, who are dying, begin to invite the dog owner, Julia’s father and partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz <0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D>ová (who is also a producer of the film) were struggling with the narration procedures in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog were having fun there.
This time, the creative couple wrote an even weaker script, which evokes a mixture of amazement and feelings of embarrassment.
Let's sum it up.
Julia, although a scientist, is subject to a family delusions in her desire for a child, and if the right “constellation” comes to her heart, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever she determines the coordinates – on the hood of the car or the church tower (of course, during the actual excursion with the local guide), the retired Myrtle’s flight attendant.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of animal pets.
The owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at what a content dump full of unbelievable situations and figures was needed for this message.
A couple of thieves from the staff, a competition of dog handlers, a <0xC5><0xA0>umava charlatan, policemen coming to pretend to look for “drugs” and discussing herbs about the festering power of bone meal – and which, of course, drunken family in the guesthouse.
When the heroine wakes up after a severe coma and immediately sits naondulated and dressed with a cigarette at the family table and demands her father’s whiskey and flask as a cured vegetarian, you can’t help but laugh.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that “this sometimes happens after a coma”.
<0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D>’s team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to build load-bearing situations, a sense of character and point and directional leadership.
The acting performances are uneven, the cut is helpless and the overall impression is dull.
No matter how hard Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Vacul<0xC3><0xAD>k, Jitka Je<0xC5><0xBE>ková or Nela Boudová try to hold on to their party, they have little to play.
The only positive aspects of the film remain the poetic shots of nature in <0xC5><0xA0>umava by cameraman Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to draw a few characters, a chatty plot and dog talk, let alone the more vulgar expressions that the characters indulge in.
The argument is not even the age of membership in the Dachshund Breeders Club - as in the case of the producer.
For good intentions to promote the nature and friendship of a man with a dog, there must also be a knowledge of the craft, if a man wants to tell a believable story.
This did not work in this case.
For a good family shot there is a little too much eroticism and a minimum of feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateurishly conceived piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant swearing exactly from jerks like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, and you can see how shitty you are, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he does not want, the answer will always be no.
If you'd listened to a kid like that all the time, you might have changed your mind.
It's a job like any other, in this case, a brigade for extra income.
The Middle East is plagued by unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"The near-total absence of precipitation during November, as we have seen at some stations, is unusual," the Israel Meteorological Service said in a statement.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term rainfall average for November.
This week’s two-day rain was an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a long time.
It is also the right Christmas scene, Wasim Ashkar rejoiced over the people of Nazareth.
Precipitation in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, is bumpy and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry up and are prone to fires.
It is not only about forests, but also about supplies of drinking water and irrigation for farmers.
Israel’s largest freshwater spring, the Sea of Galilee, was filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water managers have warned of drought for a long time.
“It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, precipitation may decrease here,” said Israel’s Water Authority spokeswoman Uri Schor in 2018.
Israel can help with technologies such as desalination or waste water recycling.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, there is an increase in tank cars.
Waterworks and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years," Imad Suleiman, a tanker driver, said in September.
Clashes broke out in Isfahan, Iran, between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The local riverbed was completely without water.
The region has had its driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military intervention against Iran
Israel’s defense minister said the Vienna talks had made “no progress” and that he had briefed Washington on preparations for an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for a possible military strike against Iran, according to Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who is in the U.S., is trying to persuade Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but has also briefed Washington on military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said the nuclear talks in Vienna had brought “no progress” and world powers “understand that the Iranians are playing with them.”
This happened to me about 3 years ago as well.
I patted the missus a little bit and grilled her during the interview to see what she really wanted from me.
In the end, I found out that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Since I don’t really like these scams, I gave the lady a few more doubts and questions and finally thanked her and left.
You can tell me I'm a bastard, but a pyramid is a pyramid, and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains on the weekend, there was enough snow and nice weather waiting for them
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major push of skiers this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started operating thanks to this.
The skiers were also not deterred by the obligation to prove themselves at the lifts with a Covid certificate.
While lifters do not complain about the lack of interest of customers, some ski equipment rental companies report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people set off to cross-country trails and ski slopes in the Liberec region over the weekend.
The skiers wished the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
“We are pleased that the opening weekend really came out from that Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill,” said Jakub Hanu<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the Je<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>d Sports Complex.
Hundreds of people went to Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>ky for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, the Karlov Ski Arena or the centre in Branná in the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk region were opened.
The weekend attendance was very decent, on Saturday and today came an estimated 400 people.
The conditions are awesome.
Today the sun was shining, it was about minus three degrees, so the perfect, did not spare praise representative of the ski resort in Branná Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can only sell a ski pass to people who are vaccinated or who are within the time limit after they have had COVID-19.
Except for the exceptions, people are ready for this and prove themselves with the necessary documents, René Hrone<0xC5><0xA1> from the ski center <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n told the Czech Press Agency.
"We only recorded units of incidents," he added.
Lower interest than before the pandemic is reported by some rental and ski equipment stores.
Fortunately, the interest in ski rental is there.
It is not the same as in previous years, but there are still a lot of customers, said Alexandra Boki<0xC5><0xA1>ová from the Opava shop Skiopava.
More pressure is expected in the period of ski courses.
David <0xC5><0xA0>inták, CEO of the Hradec Králové company Snowbear, also feels that due to COVID, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost broke.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, said <0xC4><0x8C>TK <0xC5><0xA0>inták.
People with the pandemic, he said, became lazy and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a large demand is recorded by the rental company in the Novako area on Bo<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Dar.
They started renting skis there a week ago and those interested must already order them in advance.
“We are starting to lend runs this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year,” said the site’s operator Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na Nováková.
Interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also about the ski school.
If we want the successful and the rich not to go abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to find a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart and skillful people go abroad who have no property here.
The owner of the company will not go abroad.
With the rest, I totally agree.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began with Orbán winning one beautiful day, ruling for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is elections.
If it's going to be a crappy life, some traditional V4 freak can win here, too.
The young and the educated will leave, his supporters and the people whose property cannot be put on the plane will remain.
Awesome photo!
Langmaier in blood for a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, in Thailand the crew of the film Island headed by Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Langmajer (55) enjoyed tropical weather!
The actor posted a bloodied photo of his face on social media.
Is this a real injury, or is this a make-up shoot?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech.
She was last seen on her way home.
“The disappearance of Petra is nothing like her behavior and we’re starting to worry about her a lot,” Lucy O’Connor of the Lambeth Police Department said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman left her job on Sunday around 7:45 p.m. and headed home to Camberwell.
She was last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
According to the British media, she worked as a "nurse assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Association.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," a group of medical facilities said in a tweet.
“We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that could help her find it to contact the police,” the statement continued.
Harriet Harman, a member of parliament, also called on the public to cooperate, drawing attention to the case of Srncová at a press conference on Saturday.
“She’s been missing for a few days, she’s only 32 years old, she’s from the Czech Republic, her parents are obviously worried to death,” she said, holding a photograph of a woman distributed by London police.
“I feel like we all have a particularly big responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her home country, away from her family and working here for our health care,” Harman said.
Police have previously detained a man who remains in custody in connection with the case.
According to the BBC news website, however, police have not provided any information about his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. ca 5 divisions).
I don’t underestimate Ukraine in this way.
This is not a "huge amount", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and it is starting to get tired of our entry.
I quoted above.
I don’t know what made him think that Russia wanted war.
War is a hell of an expensive joke, and Russia has Italy’s GDP.
The comparison with the situation in 38 is out of place in so many points that I don’t even know where to start.
I can already compare this to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it was not going to comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia would annex the ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what "concentration" at the border would be like.
What, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables apply in Prague from Sunday, they will mainly affect suburban connections
Passengers in Prague Integrated Transport (PID) are waiting for several changes from Sunday, which mainly concern suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed the route, and others, on the contrary, disappeared.
Mladá Boleslav region is newly involved in the integrated system.
In the capital from Sunday stop express trains from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice in the station Zahradn<0xC3><0xAD> M<0xC4><0x9B>sto.
In suburban train transport, the S7 trains run from Beroun to <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Brod via Prague <0xCC><0x81>s main railway station.
The R17 express train from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice and Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ov will stop in the recently opened station Praha-Zahradn<0xC3><0xAD> M<0xC4><0x9B>sto.
The PID will now expand to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go to Sv<0xC4><0x9B>tlá nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Staré Splav<0xC5><0xAF> and Turnov.
Buses will be included in the Mladá Boleslav region, including lines to the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be canceled, 37 new ones will be introduced and traffic will be adjusted to 12 operating ones.
A new bus line 405 will start from Prague’s Zli<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>n, going all the way to <0xC5><0xBD>atec.
A new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice near Rakovn<0xC3><0xAD>k was also established, replacing the cancelled S53 train line.
They will be reinforced in the morning rush hour and at the weekend with connections from Prague to Rakovn<0xC3><0xAD>k, when the 404 express line will be launched.
Newly included in the PID system are lines 400 and 410 running in the Liberec region.
They leave from the metro station St<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>kov, not from the station Nádra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
The backbone line 400 goes through M<0xC4><0x9B>ln<0xC3><0xAD>k, Dubou and <0xC4><0x8C>eská L<0xC3><0xAD>pa to Nov<0xC3><0xBD> Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 goes through M<0xC4><0x9B>ln<0xC3><0xAD>k and Dubou to Doks, Mimo<0xC5><0x88> and Jablonného in Podje<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>d<0xC3><0xAD>.
On the contrary, the operation on ten local routes in Central Bohemia is now cancelled or restricted, including to Mochov, Dob<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xA1> or Ro<0xC5><0xBE>mitál pod T<0xC5><0x99>em<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>nem.
All trains departing from Prague at 2:30 a.m. are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Labem and around Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Changes are also expected in other areas.
Buses replace some of the cancelled railway lines or extend the section on line 420 from Dob<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xA1> with a link from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk have undergone a change and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice in the Pilsen Region have been adjusted.
Healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I do classic 9-5 with a break of 30min and my only option where to get food is to go next to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I don’t have any movement, I don’t have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry I will buy a maximum of pizza buns and a snack yogurt and an apple.
Q: What healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a meter of snow like you, so unfortunately it is.
These are not trees that you need to see.
Under the snow can hide only the tip of the tree.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I’m not saying it’s the only reason we’re banned from off-piste, but it’s one of them.
Confessions of a Gift about a Relationship with a Bear: I Wasn't Looking Forward to This at All
Since Friday, the Czech show business pond has been living only by revealing the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>d.
They have been together for years, the famous football player even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent fans a comprehensive message explaining why she kept her love a secret from them for six months.
“I dare say that currently there is no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would have missed that Dara caught a bear, that is, sorry, Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>da,” jokes Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech football player.
He said he picked it up, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they are not happy about it.
And here it is.
What we both weren’t looking forward to, but knew would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether it is those who do not care at all and it pops up on them and from the can, or we, whose lives are being dissected in detail.
It’s as if one of you wants to hear an opinion about whether you and your spouse or girlfriend are good enough together, or you insisted that everyone really know the list of your former partners in detail and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's what you want, Dara.
The pair got together in Italy, where Rollins traveled to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>d has been working there for a long time as vice-president of Juventus football club.
They went out with the truth now, waiting for Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>d's divorce to be finalized.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but they have not been married on paper for three weeks.
In any case, to those who rejoice with us and wish us so, we thank you.
We too are just people, we have families, children, a past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband, and just as he loves me, so do I. For better or for worse, Rollins concluded.
Hello, other commenters have probably already said all the essentials, I just confirm that the dormitories are great to start with, my classmates mostly met and made friends during the first semester or two and then found sublease together, which seems to me as the best option, because you know who you will live with.
Apartments usually do not advertise too long in advance, so now you probably can not find much, but it certainly does not hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, be sure to avoid not only Cejla, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, Francuzská, etc., that's a pretty bad address), and some parts of <0xC5><0xBD>idenice are a bit ghetto.
The Veve<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> district, on the other hand, is very student-friendly, the King’s Field, and it’s fine that way, besides, it’s close to most of the BUT faculties (I don’t know where exactly you’re going).
I have never been looking for a rental, but I am a native of Brno, so I can advise Brno as such, if you still lack some information :)
This is an example of “normal” thinking.
Because of what a few doctors somewhere in Poland decided to do, it is actually quite okay that the state does not sufficiently fund some schools.
Either they learn what they want and pay for it from their own or they go according to the state and pay for it by the state.
After all, we cannot let a private actor dominate a piece of education just because he adds a few crowns to a full-fledged state contribution and thanks to that he will be able to learn what he wants in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when it is written by a man who, two days earlier, had expressed himself in a petition for a boycott of the totalitarian state:
So the vote against having an abortion is the same for you as the vote against having a statue stand in the square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloguing / digitization that (even long-time professionals) either somehow throw it away, or write something in the way xxx *** or ... (according to the convention) and note that it is illegible.
The truth is that in this case it is quite readable, so I probably would not recommend it at all.
Personally, I would probably deal with it somehow in a note depending on what program you are using.
If you want to be a regular and diligent student, you can look in some character databases and find the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from some book, I'd guess that the author or printer simply created his own character that fits what's physically on that coin.
PS: Is it by any chance more the Odrysian Empire (kingdom) than the Odrysian?
P.S. Someone has already broken it for you.
Look at this comment with <0xCE><0xA6><0xCE><0x99><0xCE><0x9B>H
Politicians have no idea what will be the "theme" of our Presidency.
This is a much worse problem than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood a text is laughable.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, just some basic knowledge of English is not enough, it is a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, establishing above-standard relationships.
Moreover, it is quite interesting with the English language, after GB’s exit from the EU.
I don't understand the hate on Cejl.
I've been working there for three years and I'm fine.
How many times do I drive from work at 10 pm and never any problem.
That this is a ghetto can only say someone who has almost never entered it in his life.
Yeah, most of the Roma population of Brno live there, but all they do is stand on the sidewalk and park where they don’t have it :D it’s definitely not that I’m afraid to go out on the street in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I would go for it.
There are a lot of apartments there now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slová<0xC4><0x8D>ek (78) without Dada and his mistress Gelemová like a stake in the fence!
Who will he spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit their first candle on the Advent wreath, but not Felix Slová<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw Daddy's wreath, and Lucie certainly has one, said the saxophonist to Blesku, who confirmed to Patras that he often visited her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada was left alone after his departure.
Slovak still doesn't know where he'll be on Christmas Eve.
Recently, we met with Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slová<0xC4><0x8D>ek and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slová<0xC4><0x8D>ek and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we kept talking, so it didn't happen for Christmas.
I really don't know where I'm gonna be.
I buy gifts all the time and I will definitely buy Dad and Lucia something, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the christening of a music video for the Richman Club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slová<0xC4><0x8D>ek, who was glad to meet the wife of Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Saturday Adriana or the singer Kamila N<0xC3><0xBD>vltová.
And he made it clear.
And we are Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt that anyone will defend us and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why that would be a bad argument, so explain it to me.
I don't know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
There are few police officers and they cannot afford it, so firefighters and nowhere else such a high percentage of medically trained people at such a level do not exist.
And the fact that our army is able to defend Ostrava only goes to the heads of previous governments, not the army, it has been asking for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through its worst drought in years.
According to scientists, the water has decreased in mountain and sub-mountainous areas, a smaller amount of precipitation is recorded even in places where there has not yet been a need for moisture.
Climate change is the cause of drought in much of Central Europe.
But the impact is also amplified by the way we manage the land.
What to do about drought?
How can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, it will be like that, I can barely stay on ice in skates, I know what it is to play hockey and the tactics (what I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a big deal.
And whether you are a hockey team "bear Russia" or "Lama China" so to lose by two goals even if you do not have to win the match at all costs is different than when it is compared.
But anyway, what I listen to the Czech commentators, what the referees do not notice whether the men's or women's hockey, it's all strange, but that's probably the case with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And if it were the other way around, it is the same as always, and that the Czech Republic has already lost to Russia more often than won, it would probably be the classic "they lost" vs "we won".
Coronavirus: Number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
A total of 5,766 people were hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
The number of confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic is 1967 at 100,000, 871 at 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
This is the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The daily death toll is 1,132, the lowest since late October.
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is facing an “inevitable” large wave of infections caused by Omicron, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for Britain’s Health Safety Authority, said on television on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their numbers to rise.
So far, no one has died of omicron, but hospitalizations occur about 14 days after the infection and deaths occur about three weeks after the infection.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson had apparently broken the law by hosting a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when a lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One Johnson government minister defended that the quiz was conducted “virtually”, via a computer.
However, it was attended by groups of employees gathered around computers in Downing Street.
In the UK, pressure is mounting to remove Johnson from the premiership.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson’s ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and the media are furious that Johnson and his government were making fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV commercial television editor for the UK: Today, two years ago, Boris Johnson won the overwhelming majority in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the post of prime minister.
It’s amazing how quickly events have unfolded.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is due to hold an election in the spring that could end the 12-year rule of Viktor Orbán.
It will be a European-wide election.
How much can you expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They will probably not be free either, because that was not even the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of the constituencies to profit from it, and does other smaller or larger tricks.
So far, the last one sounds like that, in practice, everyone can vote wherever they want.
This will allow Fidesz to tie voters from the constituencies to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I repeat, they will not be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as it was in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is very different.
Previously, the question was not whether Fidesz would win, but how much and if it would have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by the united opposition.
This is very unusual for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they try to keep the power to play even harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have been doing so far.
Recently, a recording of the Speaker of the Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, Lászl<0xC3><0xB3> K<0xC3><0xB6>vér, leaked to the independent media, telling the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Is this the new approach you are talking about?
Yes, that's one of the news.
It all starts with language.
I was beaten quite often, last time at 14, my mom's parents don't have much patience, neither do I, my dad has it for a long time, but then it blows extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I was angry as a child terribly, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in a convulsion and was all blue, they took me in the shower about 2 times to calm down.
Sometimes they slapped me in the face, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to deal with things violently now, as a child I fought quite a bit, now I hit myself at least in something for the discharge and as a younger I could slap my parents over the arm for example (so as not to get too over the nose), so I never have anything extreme, but I always have this urge.
I'm not able to determine the extent to which it's my explosiveness, but I'm sure that education has a role to play.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think that beating children is just wrong and that my parents should not have done it, especially not at the moment when it was no longer “educative”, but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just shits something, maybe it is not possible to at least slightly defile their children, so I do not blame them.
I don’t know why, but I don’t see why you should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call Kundami those who make laws in such a quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you are not afraid of a loss of income?
Is it really possible to count on the fact that people want and buy the product, and you will have to pay the mortgage from what?
Ko<0xC4><0x8D>ner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the killers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins in the trial of the four accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Ku<0xC5><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xAD>rová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It moved civil society, but also revealed the practices of the accused entrepreneur Marián Ko<0xC4><0x8D>ner and his connection to the leaders of Slovak politics and justice.
How important will this process be for Slovakia?
This is a huge responsibility for journalists.
How is it possible that this petition had an order of magnitude more media attention than the counter-petition of the deans of all medical faculties, which came out a day or two later?
No, they got screwed up and the company bounced back.
On Czech television, Covid was dying six months ago.
The next government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of the repository nowhere
The proposal of Minister Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek needs to be fundamentally revised
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> has come to an end and the law, which was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and authorisation of a deep repository of highly radioactive waste, still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government suspended the discussion of the proposal submitted to the Government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against Deep Repository, but also with the Union of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
The local authorities expect the law to significantly strengthen their options when deciding on the repository, which mayors have been promised since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech atomic law and the European directive.
We expect the new government to revise the proposal in cooperation with municipalities in accordance with its coalition agreement.
The draft law from Minister Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek, which the Platform has at its disposal, is criticized by municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of deciding on the choice of location for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can be really effective only if the municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in the given locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Storage Authority to obtain the consent of the municipalities concerned before initiating a specific procedure.
The submitted proposal of the substantive plan almost completely neglects the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere extras in the permitting proceedings.
The design lacks a system setting of compensations for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a location for storage, its authorization and operation.
According to today's legal standards, municipal representatives do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in search of a place for storage.
Only in certain authorisation procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but the decision is taken by the authority or the minister in whose interest the authorisation is to be issued.
Any action shall not have a suspensive effect on the carrying out of exploration or construction work.
The co-decision requested by the Platform is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those where they have already made progress in allowing storage, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is also another failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by S<0xC3><0x9A>RAO and follows up on the contracts with the lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total sum for these works is to be almost CZK 4 million.
Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Sekni<0xC4><0x8D>ka, deputy mayor of Cejle from Hrádek and spokesman for the Platform against Deep Storage, said: “After the ministers of industry, who only referred to their successors for the settlement of the status of local authorities vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis state authorities in the search for a deep repository of highly radioactive waste, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We would also like to thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for their support, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a crucial building in the same way as directly affected municipalities in selected localities.
The Platform against Deep Storage brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and 16 associations) to push for a change in the state’s approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep storage.
The Platform further advocates that the decision to select a site for possible storage should be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) forced to lose weight fear: he lost 90 kg.
Although he did not need to change his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually frightened by the doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He made his debut in Los Angeles during the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body caused the furniture to crack.
“I put everything in my mouth,” he told AARP in 2018.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
“I’m getting to an age where I can’t afford to sit still anymore,” Goodman told ABC News.
It also depends on which boss and what you want to use the word "boss" in.
If it’s some text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I wouldn’t translate it at all.
If it were a formal text or a university text, I would probably be looking for a way to describe or explain the boss.
There are many types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, that is, and so the "boss" is something like the master/ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) that do not need to be defeated at all in order for the game or level to be completed, but they are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games such as Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player does not directly compete with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can be called so at all?
And then there are the mini-bosses.
It is simply impossible to translate the boss in a one-word way, Czech and other languages do not solve this somehow (only Catalan, which translates the boss as the final opponent, is interesting).
It is simply for the story or game in general significant, computer-controlled, the opponent stronger than all the previous and watching the completion of some level or task.
After the missing Peter from London, he searches for the whole world.
The Czech police are also involved.
The missing woman, Petra Srncová, has been wanted by British police since December 3.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> has been looking for her since December 7.
Through Interpol, he also helps the British police.
Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular because of her.
The whole world is looking for Peter.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," police spokeswoman Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Rendlová said.
"We share information about the case," she added.
The search for Peter has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Uherskohradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>.
Petra worked as a nurse at a London hospital.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such a disappearance is very unusual for her.
Harriet Harman, a member of parliament, was also involved in the search for Petra.
She was involved in putting up leaflets with Petra's face on them.
"We are very concerned about her," she told a news conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already detained one suspect.
It is not clear who he was or what he had in common with Peter.
The Czech Republic is being terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While data in October showed a slight decline in offensive campaigns, attacks intensified significantly last month as the end of the year approached.
We saw a big campaign about Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are aimed at the Czech Republic.
So far, the strategy of the attackers remains the same.
An infected attachment in an email is meant to draw the user’s attention to a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word invoice in the title, this time it was marked as a copy of the correction of the receipt for 11.2021...exe,” said Martin Jirkal from Esset.
Spyware contains features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as email clients Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The malicious code actively searches for the stored login data, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the upcoming holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, the spyware Formbook remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November captured campaigns with global reach.
Compared to October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but it is still worth almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with the extension .exe, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the receipt still appears.
Attachment in Czech can then be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
Security analysts at the Fareit program, which was behind 1.6 percent of the attacks and had no major offensive campaign in the Czech Republic in recent months, have recorded a significant decline and dampening of activity.
The smart girl today who doesn't need oxygen, because oxygen is for vaccinated morons.
The parade in Prague was bigger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the parade along the waterfront and in my experience as a demonstrator, I am not afraid of an estimate of about 10,000 people.
The people in the procession filled the waterfront and the bridge and the opposite waterfront communication.
This means that people really a lot.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously joins the procession of about four thousand demonstrators.
I say that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokry.
That the persistent discontent of several large groups or strata of the population has led them to find common ground.
Only the anti-vaxxers, anti-smokers and so on would not be able to fill or pay for such a large parade.
The actions of the Chc<0xC3><0xAD>pl pes association have an increasing popularity, it reminds me of the Million Moments for Democracy inside out.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and technique.
It's hard to say what kind of movement could be bribed out of this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the flow of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer will become a quarter or more of a dose.
It’s certainly not a left-wing or centre-left movement, you bet.
The tri-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, because it is obvious that we will have to get re-vaccinated every six months.
I am so glad that vaccines have saved our lives.
Genius actions of scientists, of which humanity is rightly proud.
End of the heel, Bulgaria has a new prime minister announcing a change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has tasked Kiril Petkov with forming a new government from the anti-corruption movement We continue the change that won the November elections.
It has already managed to form a broad coalition government that should take office in a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been going on since April, when the previous government lost the elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
The winning parties, however, were unable to come to an agreement on the fight against bribery and the abuse of power, so two early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
The "secret" footage is a global hit.
Over the weekend, there were growing concerns in Britain about the fate of the 32-year-old Czech woman, who has been under investigation by London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago driving home from work to the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, she is also being called by her current employer or a member of parliament representing the part of London where she lived.
“The disappearance of Petra is nothing like her behavior and we’re starting to worry about her a lot,” Lucy O’Connor of the Lambeth Police Department said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman left her job on Sunday around 7:45 p.m. and headed home to Camberwell.
She was last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
According to the British media, she worked as a "nurse assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Association.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," a group of medical facilities said in a tweet.
“We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that could help her find it to contact the police,” the statement continued.
Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák Kocourková (and also the regional pirate councillor) has made it anonymous to the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk amateur painter of children’s rooms Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák (and also to the regional pirate councillor) that he is infringing copyrights with his paintings.
However, the court acknowledged that the paintings of Krte<0xC4><0x8D>ek in the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk rooms do not violate the law.
In <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem there was a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a hatch.
It was a life.
The magistrate referred complaints to the <0xC5><0x98>SD, to which the road belongs, and since it did not react, the hole went further.
In the end, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the RSD “began to deal intensively with the situation.”
