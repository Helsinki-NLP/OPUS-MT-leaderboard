Put it down.

I know what a stapler looks like.
I can't confirm that.
Mary assures me of this.
I got on the wrong bus.
I refused this offer.
Mary had already done what she had to do.
I watched Tom.
Have you reserved a table?
Where did the money go?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like this one.
Use them all.
You were right.
I don't want you to die.
Turn off your cell phone, please.
I'm not rich.
I didn't think you'd understand.
Do you recognize this man?
How about going on a picnic?
We could not buy tickets to the concert until we received money from our friends.
Tom called Mary this morning.
Maybe some other time.
Tom refused to let Mary into the house.
He doesn’t play tennis very well.
I am a Palestinian.
I can’t do it alone.
Tom needs you here.
We are out of oil.
What do you think they want?
People who live in a place can not learn the pleasure of life in the village.
Mary has beautiful eyes.
She gave me a book for Christmas.
I want a cheeseburger, cola and French fries.
She stole the camera.
Welcome to your new home!
There's a problem with my account.
Tom happily agreed.
I think Tom is wrong.
Is everything okay?
You may be the only one who can do it.
Who is not right?
Your singing makes professional singers blush with shame.
You know Tom's lying.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't need a knife.
Oh, my God!
Tom's soaking wet.
He was great.
Tom knows it wasn't Mary who did it.
Esther is a Jewish lesbian.
Last week I was bitten by a dog.
You want me to ask him?
Tom and I are not afraid of Mary.
Try to swim!
You are lucky to have such a good job.
What are you holding in your hand?
We're busy.
It's dinner time.
It is unlikely that Tom will forget how it is done.
You drink?
Will Tom do it with you?
You're not sleeping?
The meeting began at the fifth day.
Mary said she liked to do it.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew that Mary was not busy.
I have only been to Tokyo once.
I got an electricity bill.
What color is his sweater?
I bought a new car last week.
I'm sure Tom will be fine.
He cut his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom would do that.
The presence of all members is mandatory.
Don't you feel comfortable?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree, too.
I'm lucky.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
I wonder if I can do it again.
We have to decide today.
Who are you planning to do this with?
We are satisfied with the decision.
This skirt is cheap.
I saw Tom kissing Mary.
He was standing at the door.
She was crying bitterly.
He repented of his sins.
You always tell me that.
Is that Mary's husband?
Sami will find out.
A witness who has seen everything with his own eyes is worth more than ten witnesses who have heard everything.
Guess who I am.
Tom went back to the hotel.
How easy is it to learn English?
I play tennis for an hour a day.
Tom is finished.
When I came into the room, she was playing the piano.
You're very nice.
Where are your manners?
They have not lost hope.
Tom threw an egg at Mary.
When do you expect to arrive?
Tom took off his shirt.
Tom went to the library.
We need to call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Did Tom tell you where the party was?
Mary is tall.
Why are you so surprised?
It's a chair.
Tom didn’t want to wait.
She filled this vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
All right, I'll bite.
I don't want to anymore.
Do you know what colors she likes?
I don't think Tom's gonna be here tonight.
Tom opened the restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're happy.
I envy your good health.
Yes, with pleasure!
She started playing an old song.
Why do they speak French?
It's a lie.
There are no pyramids in Europe.
It's almost spring.
She speaks two foreign languages.
It's too much.
Tom says I'm very naive.
Why are you telling me this?
Let's go back.
Tom is not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom is very annoying.
Are you afraid?
You ruined my life.
We need to invent a secret language.
Are you planning to stay long?
When are you planning to go to Japan?
My kids are in school.
I packed my suitcase.
I got out of the car.
Tom has a younger brother named John.
Is there anything you would like to buy?
I'm old.
I'm thinking of you.
I just did my job.
Where did all these cars come from?
I live in a giant bucket.
Pour salt on the wound.
She refused to speak English.
Tom didn’t know where to look.
We managed to cross the river.
He obviously loves you.
Why is Tom so popular?
Tom is younger than you.
I am a French teacher.
Tom is very open.
I'm hungry because I didn't have lunch.
I don't blame anyone.
The plane took off at nine o'clock.
Tom is fluent in French.
John caught a tiger and shot two lions.
Don't worry, I'll check it out myself.
Tom wiped himself dry with a towel.
What happened to Tom?
It's a bracelet.
I have plenty of time.
Allow yourself to be happy.
She wants to wait until the wedding.
I'm a little late.
I need facts.
She could not defend herself.
Tom is leaving Boston next month.
Careful, it's still hot.
Let's kiss.
Every year millions of people die of hunger.
I wondered what Tom wanted.
There was an incorrect address on the letter.
This is the last train.
Who will fight?
I found a meteorite.
I'm not happy at all.
It's all in the chocolate.
They moved to a different religion.
I should be more careful.
I jumped them.
Mary sold the car.
Thank you for your hospitality.
What is he planning?
You're the best!
Are you ever going to do that?
We were able to save them.
He is a strange person.
I just cut my hair.
Mary said she had never studied French.
I think I will buy a new car.
It's our own fault.
You're so sweet.
It will cost about fifteen dollars.
I slammed the door.
His theory is worthy of attention.
We're ashamed of Tom.
The help came too late.
It's not a new problem.
The pillow is very uncomfortable.
I wrote these books myself.
She's a tennis player.

Kyoto is an exceptionally beautiful city.
I will be 16 next month.
Do you think there’s a chance this will happen?
Come to terms with your dreams.
What time will your last lesson end?
I'm here to say goodbye, Tom.
I like this dog.
I tried to contact her.
What does she have?
How's the exam?
Where was this book published?
Tom said he wasn't tired.
Tom and Mary are doing it.
We need to help Tom.
It rained all day.
I was upset about that.
Can I have your phone number?
You should stop.
Tom's going to Boston.
Who said you could do that?
Why did you buy a flower?
The clock is 10 minutes behind.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
Speak quietly.
The sun shines during the day and the moon at night.
I got up on her.
You were right before.
I hope Tom can help.
You have the right to be happy.
What is your rating?
I have a problem with my boss.
It's a banana.
Tom will probably be punished for what he did.
Mary is your girlfriend?
London shrouded in fog.
I'm so glad you're here, Tom.
Tom is weak.
I told Tom to come to Australia.
Do you usually travel abroad?
You have to be flexible.
I believe you will win.
She went to the airport to see him.
Step aside.
He's in the kitchen.
Please, don't be angry.
They won't tell us.
Work slowly.
The capital of Brazil is Brasilia.

Listen to his honest opinion.
Aren't you on duty tonight?
Tom never had much to learn.
How's your wife, Tom?
I accept your offer.

That would be unfair.
It's either you or Jane.
If I were you, I'd ignore it.
Tom's gonna be here right now.
These are the most expensive shoes I have ever seen.
It's a Greek name.
You think I'm kidding?

How strange!
Can you read Cyrillic?

I wish you weren't such a fucking asshole.
Did Tom give you anything for me?
I could never have done it without your help.
I always have coffee and snacks for breakfast.
I'm hungry because I didn't eat breakfast.
I'm the best.

I agree with Tom.
I'm a widower.
I read this story in a book.
Does Tom still have a bike?
Keep it short.
Tom is smarter.
It was a hard night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anyone who could do that.
I'm a teacher.
You had fun, right?
I was born in 1997 in Osaka.
You have a beautiful voice.
It is important that you understand.
Tom won’t do that.
I hope Tom understands.
She spends a lot of time on the internet.

You're gonna stop.
She waited for him for hours.
Doctor, I'm sorry.
They made mistakes.

I turned on the TV, the Grand Prix was broadcast there.

You've missed a lot.
I wear boots.
You can count on me.
His book has become an object of criticism.
That would be genius.
I'm very scared.
You have to help her, and fast!
It's much worse.
I'm under a fly.
You didn't waste any time.
Who knows when Tom will do it?
Tom testified in Mary’s case.
I thought you were gone.
Tom won't catch Mary.
May I ask your name?
I wrote you ten letters.
What should we do?
Aren't you going to vote?
You should quit smoking.

You don't look anything like her.
Can you play the violin?

I'll take care of it.
Did you find any errors?

Sometimes I have trouble remembering.
Where's Mom?
He died three hours after the accident.
Do you speak Macedonian?

Very good!
You know the reason?
Check the voice mail.
She speaks three foreign languages.

Tom is not rich, and Mary is rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite pen.
Everyone was late, except me.
Let's stop!

Hi, there.
Please write your name in pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She completely ignores me.

I'm exhausted.
I was born in Osaka, but grew up in Tokyo.
You are very materialistic.
I don't understand, and I'm not used to not understanding. Please explain again.
I share everything.
The options are obvious.
The only person Tom talks about is Mary.
I want you to stay here with Tom.
It was cancelled.
My country is densely populated.
Mary said she was ready.
You have time.

Jump on the creature to kill it.
You have to go.

Do you like Chinese food?
That's why Tom went to Boston.
He retired at the age of 65.
I lost my pen.
I will continue to work.

Let us in.
I'd like some more oil.

You're one of us.
It's very nice of you to help me.
Choose an event that you remember well.
What will you have?
He has a good alibi.

Hello! Hello!
Buy me a bicycle.
The party is in full swing.
Tom is not helping.
Do you agree with us?
Entomology is more than just learning how flies fly!

What do you teach?
Tom's not dead yet.
He looked under the sofa.
I will find a way to do it.
Hey! Don't run by the pool!
They met in the front row.
Tom has good manners.
English is not my native language.
Stop by Tom.
Tom wanted to listen to Mozart.
Tom, what do you want for dinner?
It is foolish to teach that the dead can be counted.
You're wrong.
Tom's car ran out of gas.
I'm running out of money.
Tom has a decent salary.
I'll answer one more question.
I'm going to work now.
Don't believe everything you hear about Tom.
Spring has arrived.
I am looking forward to my birthday.
Not so much!
I can wait if you want.
I am very grateful for everything you have done for me.
Don't talk to me.
Behave yourself.
Tom apologized for being late.
They have twelve children.
How did the exam go?
Can you climb a tree?
You're a smart guy.
Do not open the door to anyone.
The train arrives at the fifth platform.
How many cats are in this house?
I heard you scream.
What about going to the movies?
